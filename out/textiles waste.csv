Recycled cotton company Recover raises $100M in funding led by Goldman Sachs,"Dive Brief:

Taking a step toward creating a more low-impact clothing industry, recycled cotton fiber company Recover has raised a $100 million minority equity investment led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, according to a press release. Goldman Sachs has invested alongside majority shareholders Story3 Capital Partners.

Recover, which creates recycled cotton fibers and blends for new apparel from textile waste, intends to use this investment for global expansion and increased production capacity. It currently works with companies such as Revolve, Lands’ End and Primark, per the release.

“Recover is a leading disruptor in the apparel and textiles space with much-needed sustainable solutions grounded in materials science. We’re excited to invest in Recover’s growth to accelerate scaled production and the continued development of its technologies,” Letitia Webster, managing director and chief sustainability officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Division, said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

Goldman Sach’s investment shows the increasing interest in dealing with a large environmental problem — post-industrial and post-consumer textile waste from the fashion industry — while still creating a way for businesses to produce.

Textile waste in the U.S. largely comes from discarded clothing, with around 11 million tons of textile waste put into landfills in 2018 alone, according to data by the U.S. EPA. Textile production is estimated to release around 1.2 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Recover uses some of that textile waste to create a proprietary cotton fiber and fiber blend, resulting in a more circular system. The company estimates the new funding will help it produce 350,000 metric tons of recycled cotton fiber per year by 2026, per the release.

The new capital values the company at $1.1 billion, according to multiple media reports. Press representatives from the company declined to comment on the valuation when asked by Retail Dive.

Fashion retailers are taking notice of the negative impact of textile waste as well. The RealReal, Rent the Runway, Fashionphile and others are part of a new organization called the American Circular Textiles policy group, seeking to tackle textile waste and reuse, according to Women’s Wear Daily.

The retail industry is viewed by some as inherently bad for the environment, and creating a more sustainable system isn’t easy. Recover’s website states that its recycled fibers can be “recycled for several cycles,” but do eventually degrade over time at varying rates based on what other fibers they are blended with.",,[],"['Dani James', 'Associate Editor']"
Worn Again Technologies launches Swiss textile recycling ecosystem,"Bringing together key industry players across the entire textile value chain, the initiative will support the creation of a circular economy based on Worn Again Technologies’ polymer recycling technology.

To cause a paradigm shift in the fashion industry and realise true circularity requires all members of the value chain to be on the same page and working towards the same goals, Worn Again Technologies (WAT) says.

The Swiss Textile Recycling Ecosystem is a network comprising fabric and textile manufacturers, waste collectors and sorters, as well as retailers, brand owners, and technology providers. All these parties will cooperate to make their shared sustainability vision for the sector a reality.

The partners will provide different types of textile waste to WAT’s demonstration plant, which will process 1,000 tonnes of material per year and is being built near technology scale-up partner, Sulzer Chemtech. After advanced chemical processing, virgin-like recycled fibres, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and cellulose, will be provided to the same industry players to produce new high-quality fabrics.

More precisely, the consortium will be composed of WAT’s main shareholders, Sulzer, Oerlikon, and H&M Group. In addition, Rieter will support short-staple spinning, Monosuisse will take care of PET fibre production, Coop will act as retailer, TEXAID will manage collection, sorting and provide feedstock together with Sallmann (ISA) and Serge Ferrari – all coordinated by Swiss Textiles.

The creation of Swiss Textile Recycling Ecosystem marks a key milestone in the upscaling of WAT’s recycling process technology, the firm says. It also supports its ambition to create a circular economy where non-reusable, hard-to-recycle textiles can be reintroduced into supply chains to become new fibres, textiles, and other products.

The construction of Worn Again Technologies’ first demonstration plant will start this year in Winterthur, Switzerland. It says this represents a crucial step towards upscaling and commercialising the company’s recycling process technology.

“Launching the Swiss Textile Recycling Ecosystem is a vision coming true. This leading group of like-minded organisations will help to shift the fashion industry from traditional, linear product lifecycle models to eco-conscious, circular material management,” says Erik Koep, CEO at Worn Again Technologies. “We believe that zero waste strategies can only become a reality if the entire sector is committed to acting as a whole. We see the Ecosystem as a way to align sustainability efforts across the whole textile value chain and as the next step towards a green fashion industry.”

Torsten Wintergerste, chairman of Worn Again Technologies and division president at Sulzer Chemtech, adds: “We look forward to working together with all members of the Swiss Textile Recycling Ecosystem. Their support is extremely valuable and their trust in our project is much appreciated. The Ecosystem members will support our textile recycling demonstration facility by providing textile waste that can be used as feedstock. The collaboration will also play a key role in scaling up our capabilities and building a network to support the implementation of industrial-scale plants globally.”",,[],"['Beth Wright Has Been A News Editor With Just Style Since', 'After Honing Her Journalism Skills In The World Of Local News.

Bridging the PET waste gap with C-Zyme,"Technology has the ability to tap into vast new sources for recycling PET and is based on a very selective enzyme that will only depolymerize PET and not other materials.

In February this year, Carbios, based in Clermont-Ferrand, France, succeeded in producing both 100% enzymatically recycled white PET fibre and bottle-grade PET from mixed coloured textile waste, using its C-Zyme process.

The significance of this achievement was underlined by Bruno Langlois, the company’s business development and partnership director, at EDANA’s International Nonwovens Conference held in Lyon, France, on June 8-9.

C-Zyme means that virtually all PET that goes onto the market now has the potential to be recycled

“Fibre to fibre recycling is the only way to achieve true circularity and for the pledges fashion brands have already made to be realised,” he said. “Our technology has the ability to tap into vast new sources for recycling PET and is based on a very selective enzyme that will only depolymerize PET and not other materials in waste clothing, such as adhesives, dyes and other polymers.

“The process is low temperature and operates at atmospheric pressure with no solvents. The PET is extracted and separated and the recovered monomers are virgin quality.”

Prior to the C-Zyme process, the waste textiles are shredded and densified to reduce crystallinity and increase the surface area. C-Zyme can then degrade 98% of such a mass in 16 hours.

Langlois pointed out that around 90 million tons of PET is produced each year, with around 27 millions tons going into packaging and the remainder used to make fibres.

Currently, only 13% of textile waste is recycled, and mainly into lower quality applications such as nonwoven padding, insulation or wipes.

Not surprisingly, things are moving fast for the company, whose demonstration plant has been operational since September 2021. Since validating the C-Zyme process, it has subsequently partnered with Indorama Ventures to build an enzymatic PET bio-recycling production plant in Longlaville, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France, with a processing capacity of around 50,000 tons of post-consumer PET waste per year by 2025 – the equivalent to 2 billion PET bottles.

From January 1st 2025, the separate collection of textile waste, which is already in place in some countries, will be mandatory for all EU Member States and the Carbios process will be one of the solutions that will enable this waste to be sustainably recovered and included in a true circular economy model.

“C-Zyme means that virtually all PET that goes onto the market now has the potential to be recycled,” Langlois said. “We are targeting 90-95% recovery of polymers from the textile waste material.”

XDD Debuts 2nd Skin Eco-Friendly Stretch Denim for One-Size Fit,"XDD has developed a new denim fabric called 2nd Skin, which is manufactured to provide jeans wearers with a sustainable ultra-stretch feel with excellent recovery capabilities.

2nd Skin is XDD’s newest “One-Size Fit” collection that can fit a range of differently sized people, as the jeans may be snugger on larger frames and baggier on smaller bodies. The collection is part of the One-Size Fit “story” that the textiles manufacturer launched in April during the Kingpins Show in Amsterdam. Including One-Size Fit, XDD unveiled seven stories at the event, also debuting Vintage Friendly, Black Denim, Raw Denim, Neutrals, Mild Hand Feel and Ecology Denim.

Although it is difficult to make all product fit XDD’s “one-size” standard, this story aims to deliver on that standard by offering the ultra-stretch option. There are two material elements that characterize the 2nd Skin fabric and help cater to One-Size Fit, XDD says.

The first is a spandex fiber from LYCRA® ADAPTIV, which is a patent-pending, adaptive fabric that is designed to adjust to a wearer’s functional needs. This means that when the wearer is at rest, the polymer adapts its compressive holding force to deliver the right fit, shape and control. When the wearer is in motion, the polymer adapts its elasticity to deliver improved comfort in motion and a second-skin effect, allowing the garment to better stay in place on the body. Garments made with fabrics containing LYCRA® ADAPTIV fiber are durable and are also easier to put on and take off.

The second element will be adding EcoVeroTM, a fabric produced from specially processed wood pulp and often compared to silk and cotton. This viscose fiber is certified from Lenzing, providing an eco-softness on skin with 50 percent lower emissions and waste impact than generic viscose, which is also biodegradable and sustainable.

This fabric is suitable for a skinny/slim silhouette, while also being comfortable enough to be worn for an entire day.

To produce the 2nd Skin collection and deliver the One-Size Fit promise, XDD leveraged the Aerate-Max technique, which offers the denim both a natural look and feel, and includes additional details such as eco-friendly finishes like laser treatments.

The manufacturer’s data indicates that the fabric has a 5 percent increase in stretch and recovery capabilities when compared with DualFX technology. This is a new development for the “all day comfort” direction that the industry has taken toward jeans production.

XDD preps to launch new spinning mill in 2024

To maintain its status as a true vertical mill factory that strives to embed continuous improvement in the manufacturing process, XDD will launch its new spinning factory in 2024. The facility, based in Vietnam’s Quang Ngai province, will be located next to the denim mill.

The mill’s purpose is to spin different types of products, particularly TENCEL™ Lyocell™, EcoVeroTM and ModalTM, as well as TENCEL™ x REFIBRA™, but also with T400, Creora® and other cotton products.

In combining its commitment to sustainable fabrics with vintage inspiration, responsible manufacturing processes and waste reduction, XDD aims to further develop collections that can benefit both the consumer and the environment alike. As XDD increases its capacity, the firm aims to keep the quality stable and to maintain the vintage-friendly fabric’s strength.

Generating wealth out of textile waste,"Waste is actually asset - so they say. And moves are afoot to turn waste into assets of various forms in many parts of the world including India. This, in turn, has given rise to recycling of various products, which otherwise we throw out as wastes after their use. Textile recycling, for instance is the process of recovering fiber yarn or fabric and reprocessing the textile material into useful products.

Textile waste products are gathered from different sources and are then sorted and processed depending on their condition, composition and resale value. Clothing recycling, on its parts, is part of textile recycling. It involved recovering old clothing and shoes for sorting and processing. End products include clothing suitable for re-use, cloth scraps or rags as well as fibrous material. Interest in garment recycling is rapidly on the rise, thanks to environmental awareness and landfill pressures. For entrepreneurs also, it provides a business opportunity. In addition, various charities also generate revenue through their collection initiatives for old clothing.

Kolkata-based Footstep Foundation, for instance, has teamed up with FACES and MTC Group, the four decade old company that strives to make a significant contribution towards resource management and conservation by providing raw material in the form of scrap, to recycling industries in India and across the world, to organise a trash to wealth initiative RE-Turn.

It's a mission to develop skill among girls and women to use old clothes to make new household useful products like tablecloth, table mats, coaster, table runners, pillow and cushion covers, bed covers, floor rugs etc. Through this project, not only efforts will be made to create a circular economy but also create a sustainable livelihood renewal initiative.

Mind you that every piece of clothing you are wearing has gone through a complex manufacturing process that uses a high amount of electricity, water and other energy sources. Recycling clothes saves energy by reducing or eliminating the need to make materials from scratch. One has to keep in mind that we can't keep growing more cotton and producing new clothes. To feed a growing population's appetite for consumption, we have to start recycling, or as we like to call it, pure cycling. Cotton, the primary fabric used in t-shirts, is a water-intensive crop and can be destructive for the soil. Given that it's not a food crop, it also takes away precious resources and arable land, which could be used to feed. Interestingly, by some estimates, current cotton farming could fill up land the size of modern-day Turkey.

In India, more than 1 million tonnes of textiles are thrown away every year, with most of this coming from household sources, according to the Indian Textile Journal. Textiles make up about three per cent by weight of a household bin. It is also the third-largest source of municipal solid waste in India.

Therefore, what this Kolkata-based organisation led by a woman entrepreneur Sakuntala Chanda has kicked off, can truly be a game changer, if proper awareness is created and the plan is properly executed. Return of your old and used clothes can be your return to the society and environment.",,[],[]
Fellowmind helps Spinnova transform textile production with Microsoft tools,"Technology provider Fellowmind is helping Spinnova to transform modern textile production by using Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Azure.

Spinnova has developed a technology to make textiles from wood and waste streams without the use of harmful chemicals. The material is biodegradable and recyclable, and its production does not create any waste, by-products or microplastics. In preparation for its global rollout, the company needed to digitise its operations, so sought help from Fellowmind.

“The carbon dioxide emissions of the fibre production we develop are about 65 per cent lower than in the production of cotton from its cultivation to the production of fibre, and significantly lower than in the production of polyester and viscose,” said Sanna Haavisto, information solutions manager at Spinnova.

Fellowmind helped the firm create a complete enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution based on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and Azure technologies that would enable employees to monitor and control its growing operations in real time and based on the right information.

“Of all the system vendors we met, only Fellowmind was able to introduce the new ERP as quickly as we needed,” said Haavisto. “By working together in efficient workshops, we were able to clarify the minimum level of requirements and the key processes that got us started. Since then, the development has been easy to continue, and we are constantly introducing new features as needed.”

The solution enables Spinnova to build more efficient reporting, improve process transparency, and facilitates the planning and monitoring of the business as a whole. Spinnova employees can manage operations with the right information at all stages of any process, react quickly to deviations, and automate steps that were previously manual.

The partnership with Fellowmind has unified Spinnova’s information systems into one seamless entity. As the textile manufacturer continues to grow its business – for example through collaborations with brand such as Adidas and Marimekk – Haavisto believes the ERP solution will provide an excellent foundation into the future.

“The most valuable thing in working with Fellowmind was the experts’ excellent understanding of our situation and key needs,” he said. “We didn't have to wade through hundreds of rows of tables for different requirements. Instead, we were able to exchange thoughts about our needs with Fellowmind's experts, who in turn found the right approach for this project and made it happen.”

Textile recycling service almost ready for launch,"The city is preparing to launch a textile recycling program that will divert tons of clothing and other wearable/fabric items from the waste stream, and generate revenue.

According to the city’s Solid Waste and Environmental Programs manager Chaz Newton, an agreement has been struck with Helpsy, a for-profit recycling company that will manage the program, assisted by WasteZero, which will serve as a “middle man” in moving an estimated 129 tons of textiles annually from Manchester to the Massachusetts Helpsy warehouse.

During the April 14 Board of Aldermen meeting, Newton explained that landfill capacity in New Hampshire is “slowly diminishing,” with an eventual expiration date at the state’s largest landfill, Turnkey Landfill in Rochester, forcing municipalities to find other options.

“For the time being textile recycling is a method to divert material that can easily be diverted,” Newton said.

The process will be fairly simple for residents, says Newton. Using a Textile Recycling widget on the city’s Public Works site, residents will be taken to a Helpsy request form which allows you to request your preferred day of pick up (not your usual trash day, to eliminate confusion, said Newton), along with your address and contact information. On pick-up day, just place items you’re discarding in a plastic bag, clearly labeled “for pick-up” outside your front door. WasteZero will pick up the bags and deliver them to Helpsy.

“Our main goal is to remove items from the waste stream and to recycle,” Newton said.

Based on results in other municipalities that participate with Helpsy’s program, including Hooksett, it is estimated that Manchester could divert 129 tons of textiles per year, which equates to approximately $9,000 in savings (at a projected $70 per ton) and $5,160 in revenue (at a projected $40 per ton).

The program, initially expected to be up and running by the end of April, has been delayed, Newton said. The city is awaiting the finalization of legal paperwork.

“I do not have a concrete date for when the program will be launched,” Newton said on Wednesday.

A national trend

The issue with shrinking landfill space and a glut of textiles in the waste stream is a national issue.

The US Environmental Protection Agency says the main source of textiles in municipal solid waste is from discarded clothing

The recycling rate for all textiles in 2018 was 14.7 percent, with 2.5 million tons recycled. Within this figure, EPA estimated that the recycling rate for textiles in clothing and footwear was 13 percent based on information from the American Textile Recycling Service. The rate for items such as sheets and pillowcases was 15.8 percent in 2018.

That’s where companies like Helpsy come in.

Capitalizing on the practical need for textile recycling, coupled with the financial opportunities – in 2021 the global textile recycling market was valued at more than $5 billion – companies like Helpsy are becoming more common.

Their belief that “clothes aren’t trash” is what motivates them ecologically, and amplifies their B Corp-status. Helpsy’s website reports 95 percent of textiles collected are reused, upcycled, or recycled; 75 percent of items are reusable; 20 percent are recyclable.

Items that can be recycled range from footwear and everyday clothing items, to outerwear, underwear, blankets, sports equipment and accessories (see list below).

Once bags arrived at the Helpsy warehouse items are sorted depending on what it is and their condition, landing in thrift stores around the country or other second-hand international markets. Items that are damaged or too worn get turned into rags for industrial use, stuffing and insulation.

In addition to the new municipal recycling program, Helpsy has designated collection bins already established in Manchester, at St. Paul’s United Methodist Church on Smyth Road; and Comcast on East Industrial Park Drive.

Helpsy is a certified B-Corp, meaning that while it is a for-profit company it also focuses on social and environmental gains. You can read more here from their 2021 impact report.

Items to recycle:

Anything you can wear, sleep in, or dry yourself off with – this includes any type of material composed of natural or synthetic fibers such as products made from wool, silk, linen, cotton, polyester, leather, vinyl, hemp, and rayon.

Designer Athena Gronti Creates Quilt from G-Star Raw’s Waste,"Greek artist Athena Gronti is the latest young talent to turn G-Star Raw denim waste and deadstock into an art object.

Gronti’s “Ariadne’s Thread” quilt is part of the Dutch denim brand’s “The Art of Raw” program, a collaborative project that explores the endless possibilities of denim.

Pulling inspiration from “Ariadne’s Thread,” a Greek myth in which the princess of Crete helped her beloved hero escape from a labyrinth using a thread, Gronti created a textile quilt that showcases the various textures of denim. The fabric is rough in some places and soft in others. Intricate stitching and abstract shapes add dimension.

Gronti combine disciplines such as photography and illustration within her work. Textiles, however, have a sentimental value to the designer as her grandmother was a seamstress, embroidering and using a sewing machine throughout her childhood.

“For me, it’s this parallel that I am the person to hold the beginning of the yarn for the viewer, leading them into the rich history of the material,” she said. “Denim is like the water of textiles to me. It’s crazy, it has so many paradoxes and can really change into such a wide variety of shapes and qualities.”

G-Star Raw launched The Art of Raw in May as a monthly art platform that calls on young designers to channel their creativity by transforming its denim scraps into a work of art using their mode of choice.

Teun Zwets, a 2020 graduate of the Design Academy Eindhoven in The Netherlands, was the first artist to participate. Zwets created “Denim Living,” a chair constructed from a metal frame as a base with denim waste layered on top and laminated with a binder.

Worn Again recycling plant to cut tonnes of annual textile waste,"Worn Again Technologies says the new plant represents a crucial step towards upscaling and commercialising its recycling process technology for the textile and apparel industry.

The plant will be built and operated by the UK firm and will be constructed near to one of its technology partners, Sulzer Chemtech, in Winterthur, Switzerland.

The company hopes its new industrial-scale infrastructure will help validate the closed-loop chemical recycling solution that it has developed alongside strategic partners.

The process obtains polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and cellulose from non-reusable, hard-to-recycle textiles that constitute post-industrial and post-consumer waste. The Worn Again Technologies process purifies the products by removing dyes, contaminants and impurities, a step forward from traditional recycling methods, it says, and as such, delivers high-quality, virgin-like materials that can be reintroduced into supply chains to become new fibres, textiles and other products.

Erik Koep, CEO at Worn Again Technologies, says, “The construction and operation of this demonstration plant are the next major milestones in achieving our vision for textile circularity. We look forward to starting operations soon and see this as the first plant in a global network of processing facilities.”

Torsten Wintergerste, chairman of Worn Again Technologies, adds: “We are delighted to see our technologies being leveraged to create a state-of-the-art textile recycling plant. Building it in Switzerland gives Worn Again Technologies direct access to Sulzer Chemtech’s global R&D facilities and the Swiss textile industry. We will build an ecosystem of partners around this demo plant and drive forward the creation of a circular economy of textiles. Switzerland is an ideal location for Worn Again to realise the demonstration plant with all stakeholders in the shortest time period possible.”

Isko Invests in Waste-Reducing Weaving Machines,"New weaving machines will help Isko’s mission to reduce waste.

The Turkish denim mill announced Friday it is investing in weaving machines manufacturer Itema’s latest rapier machine.

The machinery is enhanced with iSaver, a technology that makes the weaving process more sustainable. The mechatronic innovation eliminates the waste selvedge on the left side of the fabric, allowing for saving in energy and raw materials, halving the cotton waste that typically results from the weft yarn.

Itema is the only weaving machine manufacturer to provide denim mills with a loom specifically designed to weave denim. Fatih Konukoğlu, Isko CEO, said the company saw “great potential” in Itema’s technology to further its own sustainable strategy and share a “determined, long-term approach.”

“Both our companies are leaders in their respective fields, fabric innovation and weaving technology, and this collaboration creates a common ground of excellence that will certainly benefit the whole denim world,” he added.

The technology supports Isko’s sustainable journey and investments aimed at further reducing the company’s environmental impact.

In 2021, Isko inked a licensing agreement for Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel’s (HKRITA) award-winning Green Machine, a one-of-a-kind technology that fully separates and recycles cotton and polyester blends at scale. The Green Machine uses an innovative and ultra-efficient hydrothermal treatment method that decomposes cotton into cellulose powders and enables the separation of polyester fibers from blended fabrics.

One of the most important advantages of this method is that it does not damage the polyester fibers and maintains their quality. Additionally, the closed-loop process uses only water, heat and less than 5 percent biodegradable green chemicals.

Isko is also expanding its R-Two 50+ fabrics made with a minimum of 50 percent pre- and post-consumer recycled blend. The circular approach is being applied to its most popular fabric franchises like Isko Reform, known for its high elasticity, and Isko Pop, which has softness mechanically built into the construction, with a circular twist. Over 95 percent of the collection contains a minimum of 50 percent recycled content, underscoring the company’s focus on minimizing virgin components.",,[],['Angela Velasquez']
Textile recycling tech startup triumphs in Circularity 22's Accelerate competition,"On GreenBiz Group’s Circularity 22 main stage this week in Atlanta, Georgia, four startups from across the circular economy landscape competed for the sold-out crowd’s votes to win Accelerate, the annual fast-pitch competition. Two industry experts, Francesca Whitehead, investor at G2VP, and April Crow, vice president at Circulate Capital, also provided insights and commentary on the startups’ pitches onstage.

Ultimately, textile waste management technology company Sortile captivated the audience of investors, circular economy professionals, government officials and thought leaders, and emerged victorious in the tight race.

Sortile: enabling a new paradigm for textile recycling

Sortile is working to build a more circular fashion industry. Roughly 92 million tons of global textile waste are created every year. And despite brand commitments on sustainability, including textile recycling promises, less than 0.5 percent of the global fiber market in 2020 was made from pre- and post-consumer recycled textiles, according to Textile Exchange. Sortile removes some key barriers for textile recycling, such as the difficult sorting process and lack of data.

""I started my professional career doing research on Latin American retailers,"" Sortile’s CEO Constanza Gomez, who grew up in Chile, told GreenBiz. ""I was able to have a clear view of the amount of waste that was created in the industry. It quickly became a sort of obsession to understand why textiles were not recycled.""

Sortile’s co-founders, including Gomez who gave the successful two-minute pitch on stage, developed a device that can sort clothing by fiber composition quickly and efficiently. It uses a technology called near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an optical imaging technique usually used to monitor blood oxygen levels in brains, muscles and tissue, to detect changes from injuries or disease, for example. But Gomex came up with the innovative idea to use the technology to optimize textile recycling: When combined with Sortile’s proprietary machine learning algorithms, NIRS can scan apparel and identify several fiber compositions with 95 percent accuracy, according to the startup. The device cuts processing time by more than half by eliminating the previously manual process of checking clothing tags to sort materials, at a much lower cost. Plus, this unlocks the data for its B2B customers, who gain more transparency into the stock. Companies that collect clothes (returns or donations) can sell them back to fiber recyclers — saving on disposal costs, diverting material from landfills and helping meet sustainability goals.

""Short term, we can really help propel post-consumer textile recycling,"" Gomez told GreenBiz. ""Many fiber-to-fiber recyclers are hesitant to use post-consumer waste because they do not trust the quality of the feedstock. If you can assure that the feedstock is appropriately sorted then you can propel and scale this industry.""

It's still early stages, but Sortile has a long-term vision

While the company only launched in August, it already has garnered grants, engaged in consulting projects and scored customers. ""We have three paid beta customers, including Goodwill,"" Costanza said onstage, adding that ""the results from our first pilot completely surpassed our expectations. We were able to triple the volume that we're processing and increased revenue per pound by 15 percent. And we're only just getting started.""

Whitehead gave her seal of approval, as well, noting how unique all of the startups’ technologies were, but that the textile value chain was a special interest for her. ""Being able to understand what's in clothing — because so much is a blend, and that's part of the challenge of being able to recycle it — and sorting is also difficult, so having any tools that are able to help is very valuable,"" she said.

What’s next? This win provides validation for the company, Gomez told GreenBiz. The company is also looking ahead to raise its pre-seed funding.

[Missed Circularity 22? Catch up with all our coverage.]

Gomez also said that long term, she wants to change the economics around textile waste: ""By making this a profitable stream for sorters then you change collection incentives and change the focus of only collecting for the second-hand market to collecting all textile waste. Additionally, collection will always be local, but recycling is a volumes industry. Since we collect data on everything that goes through our device, it allows for visibility into volumes which will aid in aggregating and creating consistent volumes which are crucial to scale textile recycling.""

The runners-up: Circularize, re:3D, and StarWalker

The other compelling pitches on the main stage came from more circular economy entrepreneurs from around the world and right from Atlanta.

Samantha Snabes is co-founder of re:3D, which boosts the use of recycled materials in lifesize 3D printing. The startup manufactures a device called Gigabot, an affordable industrial 3D printer that can directly print from plastic waste.

David M. Walker also presented StarWalker Industries, which supplies the community of Atlanta with bottled water (Integrity Purified Water and Positivity Alkaline Water) and provides the largest incentive to return the bottles available. The company is in the process of building a micro bottled water plant and recycling center, fostering a local closed loop system.

In addition, Mesbah Sabur, founder of Netherlands-based blockchain startup Circularise, showed how the new platform can create new transparency and traceability across supply chains. The goal? Help companies verify key product-related data (such as material composition, origin, certification and CO2 emissions) all on a public blockchain, which would allow them to improve ESG performance, demonstrate responsible sourcing and make progress towards a circular economy.",,[],[]
Inside China's plan to clean up its textile industry,"Green clothing brands and efficient recycling systems are only a part of what needs to change for fashion to become less polluting.

With sustainable clothing brands slowly emerging in China, Chinese consumers are gaining eco-consciousness about the source of the fabrics they wear. The budding awareness coincides with Beijing’s ambitious green plan to become carbon neutral by 2060, and recently, it announced a new goal to tackle the notoriously polluting textile industry.

China has been the world's top textile exporter, churning out over 20 billion pieces in 2020 - over half of textiles in the world. In that same year, China produced roughly 22 million tonnes of textile waste, with only 1.5 million tonnes recycled - which accounts for about 20 percent of the total waste.

In April, the Chinese government set a new goal to increase the recycling rate of textile waste from 20 percent to 30 percent by 2030 through a relatively ""more comprehensive"" recycling mechanism and a campaign to raise consumers' and producers' awareness about recycling.

Beijing said it plans to promote low-carbon textile production, encourage using sustainable fibers, strengthen producers’ social responsibility, improve the current textile recycling system and raise investment in research and development for textile recycling technology, among other steps.

How dirty is the textile industry?

A study showed that Chinese textile enterprises account for over 6 percent of the carbon emissions of all industrial enterprises in 2015. Up to 60 percent of the global fiber production goes to the fashion industry, which is estimated to produce about one-tenth of global carbon emissions. In China, textile manufacturing relies heavily on coal-based energy and is estimated to have a 40 percent larger carbon footprint than textiles made in Turkey or Europe.

The textile industry is also infamous for its massive water usage. The production of a tonne of textile requires the use of 200 tonnes of water, with cotton production consuming up to 95 percent. China’s textile industry consumes over 850 Mt of water - approximately 6.3 percent of the total national water consumption. A pair of jeans can consume over 3,700 liters of water and produce over 33kg of carbon.

Textile factories in China also generate over 15 tonnes of hazardous waste during production. Sludge takes up over 40 percent of the waste, but only about one-third of that was recycled. About 28 percent of the waste comes from food or human activities, but only 20 percent of those were recycled, data from 2015 showed.

An expert in China told state media China Daily that the use of each kilogram of recycled textile waste can help reduce carbon emissions by 3.6kg and save 6,000 liters of water.

On the demand side, however, only less than 1 percent of the post-consumption fashion items were recycled in China. Many of the discarded fashion apparels are sent to landfills, incinerators or waste-to-energy plants. And although about 19% percent of Chinese people sell their clothes to recycling stations in an informal practice, the low recycling prices have sometimes prompted informal recyclers to refuse accepting them.

Challenges to a greener system

Post-industrial waste is relatively easier to tackle than post-consumer waste in China’s textile industry, according to Dr Edwin Keh, CEO of the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel and a lecturer on global supply chain operations and sustainability at the University of Pennsylvania.

""Post industrial waste, waste generated in the manufacturing process, is easier to deal with. These are essentially new, unused materials that can be collected and sorted by composition and colour,"" Dr Keh told FairPlanet. ""These materials are relative high value and there are multiple recycling technologies that can be deployed to either mechanically or chemically reprocess these back into yarns or other useful materials.""

The expert added that the logistics for post-consumer waste, however, can be complex and expensive.

""Given the creativity of our fashion industry, there is lot of variety; this will not be easy,"" he said. ""Post-consumer apparel will also be in different states of use. Some maybe reused as is. Others are damaged, soiled or contaminated and cannot be used as is. These will need to be broken down and processed into other useful materials.""

""To complicate matters, most of the garments we wear today are made from blended materials. So there will be a mixture of cellulose, cotton being the most common, protein materials, like wool and silk, and petroleum derived materials like polyesters,"" he added.

What needs to change

Dr Keh warned that a few green fashion brands will not be sufficient in order to significantly slash pollution and waste in China’s textile industry. He believes the 30 percent target is ambitious, but feasible.

He suggested that the government push forward legislation and tax incentives to change consumer behaviour and that businesses experiment with different models, including subscription and rental services.

In some communities in China, people are taking action to encourage sustainable fashion. A zero-waste shop like The Bulk House in Beijing, for example, sells products made from organic materials like cotton bags, while the e-commerce platform JD.com collects donated clothes to local charities with no extra charge.

""For consumers, we need more point-of-sale educational tools and transparency about what our purchasing decisions are doing to our environment,"" Dr Keh added. ""Just like food nutrition labels or energy usage guides on appliances, we need more information.""

Ultimately, Dr Keh believes that they way in which consumers view clothes will have to change, too.

""We are one of the first generations in civilization to think of our clothes as disposable consumables. Our parents and their parents think of clothes as durables. They take care of clothes, they repair clothes, they hand their clothes off to the next generation. We have to change how we look at our clothes.""

The Textile Waste Crisis And What You Can Do,"1. Buy once, buy well… if you can

Affordable, fast fashion has its place—it’s perfect for those on-trend pieces—but where you can afford to, invest in timeless, quality pieces you can #rewear again and again and know they will go the distance. Think capsule wardrobe: a little black dress, white t-shirt and signature blazer. The amount you invest upfront will pay dividends in cost per wear.

2. Support second-hand

Op shops, vintage shops, markets, swap meets and online marketplaces—780,000 tonnes of clothing is donated to charity each year by Australians, so the more of us on board with giving pre-loved pieces a deserved encore, the less of this clothing will end up shipped overseas as part of the second-hand clothing trade. Did you know the overflow from Western World charities are sold to third-world countries where the quality items are resold but the rest—majority of which are of poor standards—is discarded into landfill*? Well, now you do.

Stylist Fleur Egan is a big supporter of second-hand fashion. Fleur talks fashion

3. Care for the clothes you have

Stains, tears, rips, missing buttons and broken zips—with fast-fashion so affordable it can be easy just to cut your losses and buy new. But by spending a little money at your local tailor (or learning to make small repairs) you can save your pieces from a dire fate.

Washing too. Instead of just piling everything into the washing machine or—if you’re really ‘adulting’ breaking it into whites and colour loads—be sure to follow the washing instructions on the label. It’s not there to make your life hard, it’s there to ensure you get longevity out of your pieces. For tough stains, invest in the Vanish Gold Multi Power range. Available at supermarkets, it's the Vanish gold standard of chlorine-free laundry booster powders, removing tough stains better than detergent alone, brightening colours, whitening whites2, removing odours3, and is antibacterial in soaking, which doubles the life of your clothes. The end result? You can love your clothes for longer and keep them out of landfill. Just be sure to check the label for suitability before you wash.

Vanish Gold Multi Power range - the go-to for fashion longevity.

4. Sell your top ticket items

Gumtree, eBay, Facebook Marketplace—there’s always been ways to sell your prized label pieces after they’re no longer serving you. But a new take on this is re-commerce play Airrobe, a platform which allows you to shop, resell, rent or recycle your pre-loved items. This is big business to, with the value of the resale economy expected to double by 2025 reaching US$77 billion ($106 billion).

5. Donate thoughtfully

With that in mind, if you buy well you shouldn’t need to donate as much—currently the average Aussie gives 12.1kgs of clothing to charity per year—but what you do donate is still of a standard where you would wear it. If it’s not good enough to give to a friend, then it’s not good enough to be resold either here in Australia, or overseas4. Also be sure to give your clothes a wash before putting them in the donation bin, and remove any stains with a remover such as those in the Vanish Gold Multi Power range. And if you really want to be sure your donations don’t end up in landfill, bag up your goods for a better cause. Upparel, for example, is an Australian initiative which recycles your unwanted items with nothing tossed or sent off-shore.

6. Rent the runway

Sure it’s nothing new with the likes of Glamcorner, Dress Hire AU and The Volte now regularly exchanged recommendations whenever someone needs a special outfit for an event, but you can now also be part of the movement by offering up your outfits for rent on The Volte as well as Outdress, Rent a Dress and Designerex—peer-to-peer services connecting lenders with renters. It’s also a way to generate passive income with some lenders reportedly making up to $1500 a week, according to The Volte.

7. Look for local

For bonus points when shopping, support companies which use locally sourced materials and manufacture in Australia, as it is likely that less transport emissions are produced. Currently only 29 per cent of respondents to the EY Australian fashion and textile industry survey 2021 sourced some materials locally. This is likely due to having to bulk buy from locally made materials, which isn’t as feasible for smaller labels. So, the more demand created by consumer power for Australian-made textiles, the more likely change will occur.

8. Choose fabrics wisely

Cotton and polyester are the two main textiles used to make clothes, however they’re certainly not equal. Cotton is a natural fibre so it can decompose faster than, say, polyester, which is a manufactured kind of plastic and takes just as long to break down as any other plastic—that being hundreds of years. So where possible, invest in biodegradable fabrics such as 100% cotton, linen and silk, and avoid synthetic fabrics such as polyester, nylon and spandex as much as possible or unless you plan to #rewear those items on repeat.

9. Invest in trans-seasonal clothes

If the pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that we can get away with less clothes than we thought. Just like lockdown, cut down your wardrobe by choosing pieces you’ll get more runtime out of and work through the seasons. Think layering options such as t-shirts and light jackets.

10. Change your shopping habits

Some fashion labels are becoming more sustainable, moving away from the old model of “make, use, dispose” and instead adopting a “make thoughtfully, use for as long as possible, and recycle at the end” plan. These brands are committed to generating little to no textile waste during production by using patterns that will make the most effective use of fabric, as well as using deadstock or leftover fabrics to create their collections so be sure to seek out and support these changemakers where you can.

Whatever change you can manage to make, ultimately it comes down to just being a more conscious shopper and taking better care of your clothes. Don’t buy a piece knowing you’ll only wear it once—always consider the lifecycle of any garment and the final destination.

How North Macedonia's fashion labels aim to reduce textile waste,"Insight

The ever-changing fashion trends end up wasting a lot of clothes... A few companies are trying to challenge that.

North Macedonia’s fashion industry has come a long way in the past few decades. Designers such as Marjan Pejoski, Toni Maticevski, Elena Luka and Risto Bimbiloski have made a name the world over with some of their designs making it to Hollywood.

Their outfits have been worn by the likes of Björk, Rihanna, Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Natalie Gal and Bridgit Mendler at the Oscars, Grammys and other high- profile events.

But what has really caught the attention of fashion enthusiasts is a brand, which is challenging the way textiles are manufactured.

Skopje-based Bastet Noir is a zero-waste clothing label that relies on single mothers as seamstresses.

The company collects pieces of clothes and garments discarded by factories around North Macedonia and then reuses the material to make trendy dresses. And it’s not just that.

As Bastet Noir’s founder Daniela Milosheska explains, the company makes clothes only on orders based on the body measurements of the clients - there is no mass production. This helps reduce waste, which damages the environment and expedites climate change.

Daniele’s story is nothing less than inspirational. She started the company in 2013 as a platform to showcase North Macedonian fashion designers to the outside world.

“At that time I was working with a woman-run studio and the seamstress I was working with became a single parent. As someone who was working hard to provide for her child, I was not only impressed by her strength, but I was also inspired by her tenacity and an iron will to provide her child with better circumstances than she was born in. This made me think long and hard about what kind of legacy I wanted to have. So I decided to make Bastet Noir a socially responsible brand.”

Bastet Noir relies on five women-owned studios where single mothers work as seamstresses to prepare its orders.

Every year, more than 90 million tons of textile waste end up at landfills and dumping sites around the world. Some of the discarded shirts and pants are made of synthetic fibers, which take a very long time to decompose, exposing our natural habitat to irreparable damage.

In this context, a new breed of designers is pushing the idea of sustainable fashion – but they say their business needs a lot of public support to survive.

In the United States, Europe and other high income countries, customers are willing to pay a premium for clothes, which are manufactured in a socially and environmentally friendly way.

But within North Macedonia, the support for such brands is still missing.

Another Skopje-based designer Rosica Mrsik’s brand produces sustainable and authentic fashion collections, which uses organic materials. “The negative side of the local scene is that due to the lack of any support, designers find it difficult to maintain new trends and a constant presence in the market,” she tells TRT World.

There are around a thousand textile manufacturers in North Macedonia, with the largest factories located in Stip, a city in the east.

Textile makers are an important part of the Macedonian processing industry, which employs over 37,000 people and makes up for 10 percent of the country's exports.

But there are multiple challenges that Bastet Noir and other eco-friendly textile manufacturers face.

Challenges and opportunities

Laws and regulations necessary to make sustainable clothing ventures profitable and help them move in tandem with the global trends are missing in North Macedonia.

“The situation regarding sustainability in the clothing industry is more complicated,” says Nikola Eftimov, who has been affiliated with the fashion industry for 25 years, “Textile manufacturers who work with western brands have been dumping leftover fabrics for decades.”

With no regulations on how to take care of this waste, some designers took it upon themselves to reuse them at their own workshops.

Difficulty in receiving online payments is hindering the growth of Macedonian textile brands.

“There are many challenges running a business from North Macedonia. The most important one for us at least is having no access to payment processing systems such as Stripe or Paypal. This is very limiting in terms of expanding your business globally,” says Daniela Milosheska.

Also, a limited access to investment funds can oftentimes leave a founder discouraged and overwhelmed, she says

Designers say for eco-friendly brands to succeed, it’s essential to continuously train the textile workers and keep an eye on evolving buying habits and changing lifestyle trends.

The industry also needs sustainable fashion-conscious followers and supporters, designers say.

Teodora Mitrovska, the owner of highly conceptual London-based brand T*MITROVSKA, tells TRT World: “I think there needs to be both a cultural and an economic push for some real positive change to be seen. As far as I am aware, in North Macedonia, fashion education needs a lot of development from its current state.”

Finding textile materials that sustainable clothing manufacturers can use is an uphill task in North Macedonia.

Emili Pisheva Godjirova, the owner of EMILI Exclusive Design, says to TRT World: “Unfortunately there aren't available materials in North Macedonia that can be used to produce sustainable clothing.”

Latest research shows that pineapple leather is more eco-friendly than traditional leather. Wool is a biodegradable fabric. Linen, better cotton, lyocell and other natural fibres are used in the sustainable clothing industry. However, North Macedonia produces little or no quantity of these materials.

Most of the raw materials are imported from Türkiye, Germany, Italy, Romania and other countries.

“Also there isn't any incentive for the sustainable industry to expand. The issue of raw material can be overcome if we get some support,” Godjirova adds.

Designers feel that the government must do more to support them.

Rosica Mrsik, an internationally established fashion designer, says : “So far, the local fashion scene is promoted either by the designers themselves or by certain individuals willing to organise events, and unfortunately there haven’t been any government initiatives to promote the industry.”

Although there are those who argue that fashion has nothing to do with luxury, people's low budget deeply affects sustainable fashion.

According to Teodora Mitrovska “In North Macedonia, you will find most fashion ateliers doing bridal and evening wear because, due to the low standard of living, most of the people can only afford to pay extra for clothes for special occasions. So, by improving the living standards, people can enjoy new fashion trends.”

"Textile vendors bring recycled, sustainable fabric lines to forefront","Swavelle Group fabrics

HIGH POINT – Suppliers at the recent Interwoven textile show in High Point showcased numerous fabric lines to support sustainability, creating opportunities for manufacturers and retailers to meet consumer demand for environmentally friendly products.

According to the Sustainable Furnishings Council’s 2021 Green Home Furnishings Consumer Survey, 97% of 7,000 respondents reported interest in buying environmentally safe furnishings, and four out of 10 of the 30- to 60-year-old homeowners surveyed said they are willing to pay up to 10% more for these items.

During Interwoven, showrooms including Crypton, Regal Fabrics, Ultrasuede, and Swavelle Group featured fabric lines that incorporate recycled materials, underscoring ongoing innovations in the sustainable textile arena.

Crypton

Crypton introduced the company’s first recycled fabric line in 2021, using natural fibers for performance textiles. The Crypton Performance Cotton fabrics are made in the U.S. at the Crypton Mills at Broad River using 50% to 70% recycled cotton, repurposed from the apparel industry.

“Crypton has a decades-long sustainability initiative that is an integral part of our brand platform,” said Elise Gabrielson, Crypton vice president of marketing. “Our brand is renowned for innovation, and every Crypton product is developed by our scientists to include inherent properties and processes that forward our commitment to sustainable design.”

Kindred by Regal Fabrics

Kindred by Regal Fabrics features a line that includes 50% natural fibers or 100% recycled material. All of Kindred’s sustainable fabrics are available with added performance finish, and two of its 100% recycled fiber fabrics are stocked with its CZero Pureformance finish, a flourocarbon-free stain repellent.

“At Regal Fabrics, we are always doing our best to choose sustainability wherever we can. With Kindred, we got to start fresh with a blank canvas so we were able to commit to sustainability every step of the way,” said Andy Kahan, market manager for Regal Fabrics. “Most important are our new value-oriented performance body fabrics that are 100% post-consumer recycled polyester.

“Unlike fabrics with only partial recycled content, by being 100%, these fabrics offer the full sustainability story and also come with performance protection that is totally free of fluorocarbons.”

Ultrasuede

Ultrasuede has a sustainability goal to continue to increase its sustainability percentage, which currently is at 14% of total fabric composition made from plant-based polyester fiber.

“Ideally, Toray (Ultrasuede’s parent company) will achieve its 100% plant-based composition goal before the end of this decade,” said Leslie Newby, CEO of WorkTheBrand, agency of record for Ultrasuede Interiors division. “Additional R&D is needed to ensure that Ultrasuede fabric maintains performance standards for cleaning, durability, and colorfastness.

“While there may be more than one road on the path to progress, Toray believes future investment in renewable raw materials aligns more completely with its sustainability goals.”

Swavelle Group

Swavelle Group serves retail fabric stores, jobbers and wholesalers, furniture manufacturers, bedding and pillow manufacturers, the RV industry and hospitality design companies and is taking steps towards sustainability in all five of its brands, as well as its workplace. The five brands Swavelle Group markets are Swavelle, TFA, Swavelle USA, Bella-Dura Home and Bella-Dura.

“The Swavelle Group is committed to protecting the environment through investing in sustainable business and manufacturing practices in our domestic mill as part of our corporate social responsibility,” said Barbara Rogers, director of marketing Swavelle Group. “Bella-Dura is proudly made in the U.S. with the only fiber on the market, synthetic or natural, that begins as a by-product and ends its life as a fully recyclable product.”

The yarns used in manufacturing Bella-Dura are solution-dyed and reduce the use of water and chemicals compared to traditional wet process. Rogers notes that this method also uses substantially less energy and produces no harmful industrial waste. Bella-Dura’s fabrics and yarns can be safely and easily recycled and used in a myriad of other products.

“Certified recycled yarns are used in the production of Swavelle USA fabrics,” Rogers told Furniture Today. “Post-industrial, recycled cotton/polyester yarns are made from apparel waste and processed back into usable fibers that are pre-sorted by color. No additional chemicals or dyes are used, resulting in a reduction in water consumption, energy use and environmental pollution.”

Swavelle also participates in a fabric recycling program where textile waste is collected and upcycled for other products to avoid any fabrics ending up in landfills.

“We encourage our customers to send back samples rather than discard them so that they can be reused or recycled as appropriate,” said Rogers. “The use of emerging technologies allows us to control waste in the product development process by encouraging customers to use simulation in the colorwork phase rather than producing numerous samples. This not only conserves material resources but also drastically reduces the time to market and our carbon footprint.”

In addition, Rogers mentioned that Swavelle Group has an internal team working on ways to refine corporate policies and initiatives that reflect sustainability and has a long-term goal to make its domestic mill fully sustainable in seven years.

Inside Future Fabrics Expo: Materials innovation in overdrive,"A key theme for this year’s event is the diversification of the fibre basket — a process that prompts brands to question why they want a particular material for a particular use rather than rely on the predictable rotation of organic cotton, recycled synthetics and bovine leather.

Another theme is the reframing of innovative materials through a broader social and political lens. “There will be a real focus on the people and communities protecting biodiversity, how we involve them in an equitable way and avoid a colonial mindset,” says Amanda Johnston, curator and educational consultant for the Expo. “We want to show the interrelationships between climate, biodiversity loss and material choices.”

In an exclusive preview of this year’s event, Marenzi and Johnston highlight some of the most promising material picks.

Alternatives to animal leather

“The most popular area is always the skin rail,” says Johnston. This year, it features more non-animal skins than ever, including options with no or low plastic, and others made from agricultural waste.

Regenerative agriculture is a hot topic this year and features heavily in the education spaces and seminar series running throughout the Expo. Maison/0, a Central Saint Martins-LVMH creative platform exploring regenerative luxury, is presenting Rewilding Textiles, a guide to the topic.

Companies that prefer to avoid animal leather will have plenty of options. Marenzi highlights Hide Biotech, a protein biomaterial leather alternative engineered from collagen, and Natural Fibre Welding’s bio-based, plastic-free offering Mirium, used by Camper and Pangaia. Ecovative, which formed a cooperative with PVH and Bestseller late last year, is also on the roster.

“Before, people who wanted alternatives to leather were forced to work with plastic, without fully understanding how that contributes to plastic pollution,” says Marenzi. “There’s a far more nuanced conversation around leather and its alternatives now, rather than the broad-brush ‘no leather’ approach of previous years.” The 2022 Expo includes an exhibition space dedicated to plastic-free fashion, led by Siân Sutherland, co-founder of lobbying organisation A Plastic Planet.

Emerging innovators

Natural dyes also take prominence this year, offering new options to replace conventional synthetic dyes and introducing alternatives powered by algae or bacteria. Colorifix and Living Ink are two to check out, says Marenzi. Central Saint Martins graduate Scarlett Yang is a name-to-know here, using algae extract and silk cocoon to create a glass-like material that grows over time and can decompose in water within 24 hours. “Algae and microbial dyes are booming,” she adds.",,[],"['Condé Nast', 'Bella Webb']"
modern synthesis just raised $4.1M to grow textiles from microbes,"Modern Synthesis grows with new investment

Biomaterials startup Modern Synthesis has bagged over $4 million in seed funding to accelerate the development of its microbial textile platform. Founded by Jen Keane and Ben Reeve, the London-based company is growing materials of the future with microbes with the aim of curbing fashion industry emissions and plastic pollution.

According to one of the investors, AgFunder, most of the investment will be used to build a new pilot facility in southwest London, enabling Modern Synthesis to expand its team, increase its capacity, and scale up the production of these materials as quickly, widely, and responsibly as possible.

‘We are excited to be partnering with a group of investors who share our optimism for a brighter material future and bring a wealth of experience from both biotech and fashion sectors to our team,’ said Modern Synthesis via Instagram.

what is microbial weaving?

Modern Synthesis’ patent-pending microbial weaving process uses a bacteria called k.rhaeticus, which is one of the bacteria found in kombucha tea, to ‘weave’ customizable biotextiles and composites. It’s a biofabrication process, meaning the material is actually grown from a microbe; the k.rhaeticus bacteria trail tiny fibers of nanocellulose behind them as they grow to form a dense non-woven fiber. To shape an object, the team creates a scaffold using robotics to place fibers in the desired shape or structure. The bacteria then grow material around those structures to create a strong, lightweight biomaterial.

‘Technically speaking, it’s not really weaving, but it’s a good analogy,’ explains the company. ‘If we talk about our process in the context of traditional weaving: we’re weaving the warp, and the bacteria are growing the weft.’

﻿

the applications

One of the biggest advantages of microbial weaving is that, much like 3D printing, you can grow an object to the exact shape, meaning very little or no waste. In 2018, Keane explored the applications of the biomaterial grown from k.rhaeticus by growing the upper part of a shoe. Modern Synthesis also explored giving the shoe a color by collaborating with bioengineer Marcus Walker, who has used genetic engineering techniques to develop a self-dyeing bacteria that produces both cellulose and melanin. Using this bacterium, Modern Synthesis grew a 100% compostable black shoe colored by a single genetically modified organism (GMO).

Modern Synthesis revealed to AFN that it has already delivered its materials to a ‘key sportswear customer’ for prototyping.

As it moves forward, the startup will continue its mission to replace animal- and petrochemical-derived materials and contribute toward a circular economy by designing out waste.

‘What we’re trying to do is build this new class of materials that is more sustainable but also allows us to design and create in new ways, which is really exciting for the fashion industry,’ Keane told AFN. ‘At the end of the day, we’re trying to build a circular manufacturing system with these microbes. That enables us to leverage agricultural waste and use the microbes as manufacturing units and transfer them into more viable materials. On the flip side, we see the opportunity to have new-class materials that are fully cellulosic, so we can recycle them back into silos and recycling streams.’

Waste and recycling: Commission seeks views on revision of the Waste Framework Directive,"Today, the Commission is launching a public consultation on the revision of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD), including setting of EU food waste reduction targets. The revision aims to improve the overall environmental outcome of waste management in line with the waste hierarchy and the implementation of the polluter pays principle. The public consultation is open for feedback until 16 August 2022. It will focus on the following policy areas: prevention (including reduction of food waste), separate collection, waste oils and textiles and the application of the waste hierarchy and the polluter pays principle. This revision considers several legislative review clauses referred to in the Directive as well as the policy objectives set in The European Green Deal, the Farm to Fork Strategy and the Circular Economy Action Plan .



Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, Virginijus Sinkevičius, said

To achieve the circular economy and climate neutrality objectives of the European Green Deal, we need to make a stronger effort to avoid generating waste in the first place and to make our waste management sector more performant. This is what we want to do with this revision and are working to set for the first time food waste reduction targets. I am looking forward to your views on how to make products more useful and less wasteful at the end of their life.

Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides, said:

The challenges posed to our climate and biodiversity, the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflicts make the transition to resilient and sustainable food systems that protect both people and the planet even more important. Food waste is one of the greatest sources of inefficiency in our food systems. We must step up our efforts to curb such waste. By introducing legally binding targets to reduce food waste, we intend to reduce the environmental footprint of food systems and accelerate the EU's progress towards our global commitment to halve food waste by 2030.

The public consultation will provide insights for the ongoing work on the impact assessment that will accompany the Commission proposal. The Commission invites citizens and other interested parties to express views on the following elements:

Waste reduction and prevention

Food waste reduction

Separate collection systems

Regulatory and economic incentives

The consultation will run until 16 August 2022 and is available here.

Background

The EU waste policy provides a framework to improve waste prevention and management, stimulate innovation in separate collection and recycling of waste, limit the use of landfilling, and create incentives to change consumer behaviour.

The Waste Framework Directive also lays down fundamental waste prevention and management principles based on the five-step “waste hierarchy”. It establishes an order of preference for managing and disposing of waste. Under this hierarchy, preventing waste is the preferred option, and sending waste to landfill should be the last resort.

Coalition promotes circular policies in US textiles,"NEW YORK – A new coalition comprising several circular solutions specialists has been launched in a bid to advance policy in the United States.

Led by the Circular Services Group (CSG) and Resource Recycling Systems (RRS), the American Circular Textiles (ACT) policy group will look to promote mechanisms capable of improving textile reuse rates and mitigating waste.

As one of its members, Rent the Runway’s head of sustainability, Megan Farrell, commented: “To take our collective work to the next level, we need solutions that will help scale textile recycling and reuse once a garment has reached the end of its wearable life. We’re happy to join ACT and drive progress on this important work together.”",,[],"['Chris Remington', 'Friday', 'Thursday', 'Wednesday', 'Monday']"
The Downside Of Fast Fashion,"If I were asked to organize a debate on the complex topic such as the downside of ‘fast fashion’, I’d organize a mind map with simple headings: rethink, rewear, replace, recycle, reuse, re-invent, dump. Then I’d ask the participants to watch what I consider essential viewing on the topic — this video on the role of Prato in northern Italy as a model for how the fashion industry can adapt its whole approach to using fabric waste. I’d also recommend Italics Magazine’s recent analysis on the role of Prato in the Italy-China fashion bond.

I would also suggest CBI’s (Center for the Promotion of Imports from developing countries) in-depth look at the European market potential for recycled fashion, which contains an analysis on the state of play of the circular fashion model, country by country, and hits us with statistics claiming that only about 50% of collected textiles are reused of which only 1% is made into new clothes. Such statistics make stark reading.

Another reliable source for information on the effects of clothing over-production that, above all, gives a glimmer of hope in the midst of the present consumer marathon is McKinsey & Company’s sustainability insights.

Trends, by their nature, come and go

From the Prato video we can see that, until recently, waste and pollution from used fabric was for too long one of the less talked about environmental issues. Not anymore. Starting from the production of yarn, the consensus that the planet cannot and must not go on producing natural fabrics at the present rate is being led mainly by consumers and, consequently, by the fashion producers who know better than most how to read trends. They create them after all!

So, what do we know? Firstly, there is already more than enough natural material already available such as cotton, linen, hemp, bamboo, jute — and from animals, wool, silk, angora, mohair — to feed the fashion industry for decades; secondly, the technology is there to make recycled natural fabrics perfectly safe and suitable for the production of garments; thirdly, the ultimate aim must be the application of the circular rather than the linear economy model to the world of fashion. The Ellen McArthur Foundation makes an excellent examination on the last point in this overview.

When it comes to recycling, clothing cannot come under an umbrella-type description. There can be no room for improvisation, or any effort at reusing fabric is destined to give unsatisfactory results, and even worsen an already challenging situation. They must be collected in separated systems as contamination with other waste material, even fabrics, renders the clothing unfit for recycling. Synthetic or man-made fibres present particular problems in landfills. According to the experts in Prato, it is essential to reduce production of these fabrics as they contain crude oil that will not decompose in landfill, they basically break up into smaller and smaller particles (i.e. microplastics) that eventually end up in the soil, in the water and in the foods we consume and, finally, in our own bodies.

This is a target that cannot be reached without a complete change in our approach to how we consider clothes. To get first-hand information on the situation in my own country, Ireland, I approached Thornton Waste Disposal manager David Duff who suggested that the consumer has the greatest responsibility to promote changes of attitude. Just as the consumption of plastic for wrapping and carrying one’s shopping is being taken on board by the consumer and by legislation with the producers and traders following this trend, so he believes will happen with reusing fabrics.

We have some great examples of the ‘power of one’ to make change, from the top of the pile of fashion influencers as it were. Kate Middleton, The Duchess of Cornwall, wife of the future King of Britain, regularly appears in public in gowns worn on other occasions. Indeed, her children recently appeared at the Queen’s Jubilee celebrations with her son wearing the same outfit his father, Prince William, wore almost forty years ago. The choice was applauded and no longer raised eyebrows unlike some years ago when, here in Italy, the then-Minister for Labor, Elsa Fornero, made newspaper and talkshow headlines in a derogatory manner for wearing the same outfit a few times at public events.

Waste disposal cannot be a shoestring proposal

There’s no going back to the haphazard way of gathering and disposing of waste. There’s too much at stake. If things are to have any chance of changing it will take greater awareness of how recycling works and how essential it is to have correct information feeding into that awareness. Recycling is much more than just selecting the appropriate bin. Duff suggests that while the fashion industry creates products and must make an effort to produce goods of a single clean material type, or easily separable parts, it is the purchaser — be it wholesaler, retailer or consumer — who has the responsibility of knowing how to dispose of them and the obligation to the environment to do so. In some cases, people in developed counties use recycling as a cheap way of getting rid of what we no longer have any use for.

The question we have to ask before we recycle clothing by putting it into the clothes banks is simple: is this piece of clothing suitable for someone else to wear? If the answer is no, then it is not recyclable. Duff’s conclusion is sharp and hard-hitting. Developed countries are trying to reach higher and higher recycling targets and they do so by exporting their materials to other counties. Everything is then counted as recycled. Obligations fulfilled. This is the flaw in our systems. Only what can be reused should be counted.

Out of sight and doing damage

One article on the topic at hand that had the impact of a kick in the stomach of the developed world and that I strongly recommend reading is “Dead White Man’s Clothes,” which asserts that 85% of fast fashion ends up in landfills in developing countries, such as Ghana, and that fashion industry waste is directly contributing to climate change.

Most of the clothing that is put into textile banks is exported to the developing world. If the clothes are of good quality they are providing a very important industry there in the second-hand clothes trade, and providing people with affordable clothing. It would appear from Ghana’s situation as referred to in the article that 40% is unsuitable and is ending up in landfills there instead of landfills or incinerators in developed counties. The landfills in developed counties are highly managed and highly regulated facilities. They have to adhere to strict environmental rules and the risk of pollution is greatly controlled and reduced. Landfills in developing countries are often the opposite but there is no longer space or time for finger pointing. The developing countries produce both high- and low-quality goods because there’s a market for both. And the market changes and reinvents itself so rapidly that growth in textile production and consequent waste will increase too.

Reading up on current trends, I found this very interesting website on ethical clothing and a list of Italian brands that have this mission. They give a concise definition of what constitutes an ethical brand and list 15 of what they consider Italy’s best Planet Friendly Fashion Houses. How are they judged? They are companies that in their production positively impact the three key pillars of People, Planet, and Animals. Personally I think that we are a long way from a sustainable solution. When will it become fashionable to see the ‘stars on the red carpet’ wear the same clothing time and time again? When will we see people buying clothing because it is made well and not because it was so cheap or it was at an unbelievable discount? The industry knows that we are all suckers for discounts.

Because of its role as leader in the fashion world, Italy has to shoulder much of the burden of squarely addressing the issue of fashion waste and its long-term consequences. Not an easy or cheap dilemma to tackle. Maybe we need a generation that is willing to make more personal sacrifice than many of us are comfortable with for the sake of the well being of the planet. It’s not easy to think of issues in the abstract but, as the activists love to put on their placards, there is no ‘Planet B’.",,[],"['Frances Fahy', 'Camilla Valerio', 'Gina Ledonne', 'Zachary Vogt', 'Matias Nestore', 'Born In Galway', 'Ireland', 'Frances Graduated In English', 'French', 'History Maynooth University.

"What Are You Wearing? History, Complexity and a Lot of Art.","FABRIC: The Hidden History of the Material World, by Victoria Finlay

“What are you wearing?” It’s a question that typically invokes designers, brands and trends. Little consideration is given to the materiality of what we wear. The textiles in our lives tend to operate with inappreciable fanfare — often serving as artistic intermediary. In her latest book, Victoria Finlay gives them their due.

“Fabric: The Hidden History of the Material World” teases out the stories behind the materials — exalting them as builders of civilizations, instruments of advancement and keepers of sacred tradition. Just as she did in “Color: A Natural History of the Palette,” Finlay provides an exhaustive exploration that spans the breadth of the globe over the course of centuries. It’s a tall order, to be sure — but she delivers, and does so with deft cultural consciousness. Additionally, she writes of these materials with such wonderment — such reverence — that one cannot help believing in the “hidden magic” she insists is spun into each fiber.",,[],['Raissa Bretaña']

Alpine Group to tackle period poverty using textile waste,"Alpine Group, which supplies brands including Sweaty Betty, The North Face and Under Armour is partnering with Transformation Textiles on the Dignity Kits programme which uses pre-consumer textile waste to provide each woman with adequate supplies to manage her period, from rural Africa to refugee settings.

Alpine Group says the initiative to tackle period poverty has so far positively impacted over 100,000 women in several countries and is additionally set to support a minimum of an additional 250,000 women in the next five years through the UN Commitment Maker Programme, part of the UN’s 2021 Generation Equality Forum, which was held in Paris last year.

Alpine Group has pledged to further increase the positive social impact of the initiative by committing to:

Supply a minimum of 50,000 Dignity Kits every year.

Train 3,000 women through the Dignity Kits/Training Centre program.

Supply the components of an additional 50,000 Dignity Kits each year to organisations working to support the local manufacturing of Dignity Kits and Women’s health, combating period poverty over the next five years.

Alpine Group also created a training centre through a strategic partnership with For Her Dignity, training recruits to become eligible machine operators and cutting technicians to secure long-term employment within the sewing industry: offering opportunities and long-term job security.

LVMH PRIZE 2022 : RÓISÍN PIERCE’s radical lace designs.,"The final of the ninth edition of the LVMH Prize took place at the Louis Vuitton Foundation on Thursday, June 2nd. Among the eight finalists of this ninth edition is the Irish designer Róisín Pierce, whose all-white collections turn lace and embroidery into wearable radical and romantic sculptures.

Róisín Pierce

NUMÉRO : What is your first memory about fashion? RÓISÍN PIERCE : I cannot pinpoint my first memory exactly, but my mother was always creating around me so my introduction to clothing making would have been quite young. I remember just knowing making clothes was what I wanted to do from a young age. I’d say it was in my early teens when I had this big urge to learn all I could about construction. I learned about it from almost every source I could, from patterns books, taking some garments apart and going to pattern design classes in local schools. Why did you decide to become a fashion designer? Because I felt I had something new to say and a unique design point of view. I wouldn’t have started my brand if I didn't feel I had it in me to continually design something new with each season. It’s funny because although the pieces are designed in all-white, each piece is constructed very differently; it has a thought process. A piece is not just created to sell, but created to do something new. It’s a commitment to contemporise craft while honouring its roots. Which designers (living or not) inspired you and why? I love the brand and designer Issey Miyake. His approach transcends generations, formed around a desire to empower women and transform luxury. His pleats provide ease and wearability, beautiful pieces which do not crease or become damaged from packing and travelling. His brands and sub-brands encompass different aims and undertake different surface explorations, achieving recognition and admiration within and outside of the industry. Not only are his textures commercialised and accessible, but Miyake also cares deeply about artisanal tradition, for instance, preserving the practice of washi paper bonding. He represents a meaningful, considered, and innovative approach to design, which is also reflected in my brand. Like Miyake, I’m also interested in preserving craft.

What is your professional background? My professional background is in textile design and design development, working for luxury womenswear. Before that, I studied textile design, which was quite a free and explorative course. I think the combination of the two is evident in my collections as they’re textile-based and explorative, yet occupy a luxury space due to the craftsmanship and artisanal techniques. Where does your interest in Irish lace and European craftsmanship come from ? Well I have a strong interest in my home country’s textiles. From the craft itself to the history and its cultural significance, it’s all deeply interesting and I feel a connection to it. I want to renew the skills and crafts within a sustainable practice that will be appreciated by a new generation so it lives on. Traditions and craft have been handed down to us for centuries across textiles, design and embroidery. These skills, however, and the intrinsic value they create, are waning – I want to help put the importance of preserving these skills on a global stage while also being able to interpret and develop them in modern ways. One of my favourite crafts is Clones Irish Lace which soared during the famine, as it didn’t require much in the way of materials or tools and. Many lace schools were set up so that people could earn funds for their families. These beautiful pieces were born out of such sadness. This seems to be a recurring theme with Aran knits and other clothing and textiles that were produced at the Irish workhouses for women known as the Laundries. These beautiful things were often made from the painful history of Ireland's past - it’s like wearing a little piece of our history and remembering how far we have come. Furthermore, what is interesting about exploring this dedication to tradition within Irish crafts is the connection between artisanal skills and the role of women’s work, which often symbolised far more politically- and religiously- charged realities. The legacy of Irish lace is a dichotomy. It remains a symbol of female oppression because women interned in the Magdalene Laundries were forced to participate in its manufacture, however it also represents freedom and empowerment, as Clones Lace helped families escape poverty and famine. The history is almost an emotion to me.

How did you know it was the right time to launch your own brand? Why did you want to express through it? After working for other brands, I felt there wasn't enough focus on creativity, or design development which I found quite frustrating. A brand shouldn’t exist just to sell last season's dress in a new colour. My brand was born from a desire to explore and create the new. What really excites me and drives my work is this possibility of touching new, unexplored ground. Irish traditions and the historical significance of Irish crafts and its impact on the country as a whole is something that fascinates me. I have a burning desire to explore. This is why I really like to have quite a lot of variation within each design, allowing space for showcasing a new method of creation and the possibilities of textile manipulation. My collections are very much process-led, letting my fabric manipulations guide and inform the final piece. I never really know what I’m going to create, it's like stepping into the unknown each time. Through this approach, I am able to employ different processes, resulting in design that changes while still feeling part of an overarching narrative. My brand is dedicated to innovating textiles through sustainable methods, combining hand and machine work with zero-waste sensibilities. This dedication is borne from a desire to preserve traditional textile techniques while subsequently exploring new innovations. I want to share joy with the collections, with the new textures and sweet hats. I felt it was clothing I had been searching for. In 2019, you won the first Chanel Métiers d’art prize at the Hyères festival, what did you learn from this partnership? It was such a valuable insight into how other houses create couture. It was very insightful to learn about many of the Métiers' areas of expertise, and being shown some of their handcrafted methods and techniques was amazing. As I have spoken about before, my work is about a slower practice, and an artisanal approach, so to see how it has been done and continues to be done traditionally was wonderful. It was also great to see how each of the three Métiers I worked with went about working on my designs, how they go about creation and see how design is structured in these couture houses and how each step of the process is delegated to each individual. The partnership also showed the importance of craft and provenance. I have a great appreciation and admiration for houses which invest in craft, uphold the tradition, and keep production in Paris. It’s oh so very rare and a perspective mirrored within my own work and process.",,[],['Propos Recueillis Par']
"XDD Textile Debuts Closed-Loop System, Upcoming Spinning Mill","XDD Textile, a vertically integrated fabric producer based in Hong Kong, is making strides in circularity.

The company launched a closed-loop system using the XDD Sewage Recycle Process. Through the system, the company collects garment waste and stock from local factories, as well as its own cut waste. It then dissolves and regenerates the fiber and re-spins the yarn before moving to the fabric production process. Overall, the system regenerates 10 to 15 percent of all waste collected. XDD is certified in both the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) and Carbon-Zero programs.

Many supply chain partners are looking to closed-loop systems keep products in use for longer while lessening their environmental impact. In 2020, Turkish denim mill Isko signed a licensing agreement for the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel’s (HKRITA) award-winning Green Machine, a technology that fully separates and recycles cotton and polyester blends at scale. The closed-loop process uses only water, heat and less than 5 percent biodegradable green chemicals.

A year later, it joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Jeans Redesign project, which established a set of durability and recyclability standards such as keeping a minimum of 98 percent cellulose fibers by weight, including easy-to-disassemble materials and phasing out metal rivets. It also partnered with Swedish research and development company MoRe Research, a part of Rise Research Institutes of Sweden, to continuously develop new, sustainable technologies that look to waste and cellulose-based materials to close fashion’s production loop.

Similarly, Hong Kong-based denim manufacturer Crystal Denim debuted Second Life fabric, a recycled and circular denim fabric innovation that recycles pre-consumer cut waste from industry peers into new fabric for a closed-loop denim process. The fabric is certified with Recycled Claim Standard (RCS), and includes full traceability so brands know exactly where their denim is coming from. The Wash Minus- range also uses water-efficient washing processes that recycle more than 80 percent of the water used.

In line with these efforts, XDD Textile is also focused on boosting its capacity with a new spinning mill set to open in 2024. Located beside its denim mill in Vietnam, the factory will work with Lenzing materials including Tencel Lyocell, Ecovero, Modal and Tencel Refibra. In the future, it aims to incorporate Lycra T400.",,[],['Liz Warren']
Global fashion industry to be revolutionized by sanitization technology,"An eco-friendly technology that effectively sanitises clothing could help protect the environment by dramatically slashing waste, researchers believe.

The patented technology – created by University of the West of Scotland (UWS) and Advanced Clothing Solutions (ACS) – was initially developed to disrupt ‘fast fashion’, through offering retailers and brands an alternative, environmentally friendly solution for sanitising used clothing and accessories.

Scottish Enterprise will financially support the project, which will bolster ambitions through supporting the development of a state-of the-art ‘sanitisation chamber’ – designed by researchers at UWS. The chamber will be installed at ACS’s automated fashion fulfilment facility on the outskirts of Glasgow.

Dr Mohammed Yaseen, of UWS’s School of Computing, Engineering and Physical Sciences, said: “This revolutionary technology has real potential to disrupt the fashion and textile industry and offers huge environmental benefits, which could see a significant reduction in landfill waste from clothing.”

After rigorous trials the system has been shown to effectively kill a vast range of germs and viruses, such as E. coli, S. aureus and coronavirus, which can remain on clothing and fashion accessories. It is now being successfully trialled on PPE, making it safe to reuse, which could significantly reduce environmental waste from PPE products.

Anthony Burns, Chief Operating Officer of ACS Clothing, said: “At ACS, we are known for helping retailers to grow their sustainable and circular fashion ambitions by providing a complete rental and resale service, managing the entire process from our purpose-built facility. However, introducing circularity and reuse of PPE has presented an interesting but not insurmountable environmental opportunity.

“Every piece of PPE presents a sustainability and recycling challenge. Many items were initially deemed single-use because knowledge of sterilising these items wasn’t available. With sterilisation technology, we hope to reverse much of this single-use problem. We are delighted to have put our partnership with UWS to good use to help develop revolutionary eco-friendly sterilisation technology that can drastically reduce landfill waste from clothing, textiles, and PPE products.”

Dr Yaseen added: “The eco-friendly solution uses ozone gas to decontaminate fabrics, which subsequently helps to reduce the use of water and avoid negative environmental impacts from detergent use.

“The success of the project is undoubtedly due to the strong partnership between UWS and ACS, initiated through Innovate UK’s Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) programme. Our KTP Associate, Dr Emmanuel Epelle, has been central to the project’s success.”

Glasgow-based ACS prolong the life of used or damaged garments for some of the country’s biggest brands, through their sustainable textile repair, refurbishment, and cleaning service.

Forty percent of clothing purchased online is returned, with less than half of it being resold and the remainder ending up at landfill sites, or being burned. Through extending the lifetime of a garment by three months, its carbon footprint is reduced by 10% and a pre-owned purchase, or a rented garment, saves 1kg in waste, 3,040 litres of water, and 22kg CO 2 . ACS clean around 45,000 garments each week.

The revolutionary technology, which is the result of a knowledge exchange project, through UWS’s KTP programme, could help to drastically reduce landfill waste from clothing, textiles, and PPE products – offering far-reaching environmental benefits.

Knowledge Transfer Partnerships are a flagship programme from Innovate UK and form a collaboration between a business, an academic institution, and a graduate. The graduate is employed by the academic institution as a ‘KTP Associate’ who works full-time at the business involved, under the guidance of an expert academic team. This three-way partnership forges strong ties between industry and academia and helps to deliver solutions to real-world problems.",,[],[]
"Ensure organic waste from slaughterhouse, fish markets do not reach landfills sites: DPCC to MCD","In a bid to prevent fires at dumpsites and the subsequent deterioration of air quality in the national capital, Delhi's pollution control body has directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to ensure that organic waste from slaughterhouses and fish markets do not end up in the landfill sites.

It has also asked the MCD to ensure that industrial as well as electronic waste, including lithium batteries, is not dumped at the landfill sites.

The organic waste dumped in a landfill produces methane when it rots. In hot weather conditions, methane catches fire spontaneously and the blaze spreads as it feeds on combustible material like textiles and plastics.

In an order issued on June 10, the pollution control body asked the MCD to install methane gas detectors (on downwind side) at the dumpsites so that areas with high methane concentration can be identified and preventive action be undertaken.

''Further temperature at windrows to be monitored with non-contact infrared thermometer (as used for monitoring human body temperature under COVID circumstances) and records be maintained for any major deviations. The temperature is to be in the range of 35 degrees Celsius to 59 degrees Celsius. Treated leachate/water to be sprayed on the waste when rise in temperature is observed,'' the order read.

Delhi has reported five massive fires at its landfill sites this year -- three at Ghazipur and two at Bhalswa.

The fire that broke out at Bhalswa on April 26 kept on raging for more than 10 days, exacerbating the already polluted air in nearby areas.

Earlier this month, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai had launched a nine-point action plan to prevent incidents of fire at landfill sites.

The plan involves construction of a peripheral road around the dumpsites to facilitate movement of vehicles, patrolling teams and fire tenders and a four-metre high boundary wall with barbed wire fencing to prevent unauthorised entry into the dumpsites.

As part of the plan, the MCD has been directed to involve an agency for segregation of waste being dumped at the landfill sites to prevent unauthorised entry of ragpickers.

Perforated high-density polyethylene pipes will be installed to prevent the accumulation of the highly flammable gas and a dedicated surveillance squad will keep a strict vigil over the activities going on at the dumpsites.

Modern Synthesis raises $4.1m to grow fashion textiles from microbes,"Disclosure: AFN’s parent company, AgFunder, is an investor in Modern Synthesis.

UK-based biomaterials startup Modern Synthesis has raised $4.1 million in seed funding to support its microbial textile platform that aims to make the fashion industry more sustainable.

Investors in the round include AgFunder, Collaborative Fund, Acequia Capital, Petri Bio, Ponderosa Ventures, Possible Ventures, IMO Ventures, Taihill Venture, Parley for the Oceans, Climate Capital Collective, and former Jimmy Choo CEO Pierre Denis.

How it works:

Modern Synthesis’ microbial textile tech leverages bacteria to transform sugar from agricultural waste into nanocellulose, a biodegradable material valued for its abundance and its strength. The goal is to replace animal- and petrochemical-derived materials, helping the fashion industry lower its carbon footprint.

The startup’s “ microbial weaving ” process mimics the warp-and-weft technique of traditional weaving to create a customizable biomaterial in roughly 10 to 14 days.

Staff at Modern Synthesis create a scaffold, using robotics to place fibers in the desired shape or structure. Genetically modified bacteria grow around those structures to create the final material.

Similar to 3D printing — and unlike traditional weaving — pieces can be designed to shape, which means no scraps of leftover material and therefore no waste.

So far, Modern Synthesis has been able to build the upper part of a shoe using this process. The company says it has delivered its materials to a “key sportswear customer” for prototyping.

It plans to eventually leverage microbes to displace a variety of animal- and petrochemical-derived leathers, textiles, and films.

Why it matters:

Instead of trying to create an exact replica for a material like leather, Modern Synthesis says it is focused on developing an entirely new kind of material – and in the process, build out an entirely separate category for materials.

“What we’re trying to do is build this new class of materials that is more sustainable but also allows us to design and create in new ways, which is really exciting for the fashion industry,” Modern Synthesis co-founder and CEO Jen Keane tells AFN.

The startup is one of a few trying to create this “new class” of materials. New York-based Bucha Bio said much the same thing in 2021 about its leather-like biotextile made by fermentation, and MycoWorks recently bagged $125 million in Series C funding to further develop its fungi-based leather alternative [disclosure: AFN‘s parent company, AgFunder, is an investor in MycoWorks.] Keane previously spent time as a creative resident at another well-known biomaterials startup, Bolt Threads.

That said, a 2021 report from the Material Innovations Initiative (MII) found that even if the biotextile space hits its projected $2.2 billion market by 2026, it will still only represent about 3% of the materials market – with 69% animal-based materials and petroleum-based items making up the rest.

Beyond demand, one of the biggest challenges facing the market is a lack of supply. “There are currently more interested investors than suitable investment opportunities,” said MII’S report.

That presents a fairly wide window of opportunity for companies like Modern Synthesis – and a new way for brands to think about sustainable clothing.

The bigger picture:

Modern Synthesis isn’t just focusing on alt-materials.

“At the end of the day, we’re trying to build a circular manufacturing system with these microbes,” says Keane. “That enables us to leverage agricultural waste and use the microbes as manufacturing units and transfer them into more viable materials. On the flip side, we see the opportunity to have new-class materials that are fully cellulosic, so we can recycle them back into silos and recycling streams.”

More than 70% of the fashion industry’s greenhouse gas emissions come from upstream processes such as raw material production, preparation, and processing.

How it’ll spend the funding:

Most of Modern Synthesis’ seed capital will go towards building its pilot facility, which will allow the company to make more materials.

The planned site in London will house a lab, as well as sampling and pilot production capabilities. It’s on track to being operational by Q3 2022.

The funds will also enable the company to build its team simultaneously to increasing capacity.

“Our goal is to get these materials out in the world as quickly, widely, and responsibly as possible. And to do that, we need to leverage as many R&D resources as we can to speed up that process,” says Keane.",,[],[]

Recycled cotton company Recover has completed a $100 million fundraise, Home Textiles Today reports, thanks to an investment led by Goldman Sachs with participation from majority shareholder Story3 Capital Partners. Based in Spain, the fourth-generation family-owned company was founded in 1914 as a textile producer, before pivoting in 2006 to focus on converting textile waste into recycled cotton fiber for an end product that results in low operating costs and a minimal carbon footprint. With the new capital, the company plans to expand beyond its current manufacturing centers in Spain, Pakistan and Bangladesh, adding an additional location in Bangladesh and a new facility in Vietnam this year before shifting its focus to Asia and Latin America. As part of the deal, Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s managing director and chief sustainability officer Letitia Webster will join the board of directors at Recover, which is now valued at about $1.1 billion.

Luxury carpet and rug company Stark has acquired Minneapolis-based residential and commercial flooring provider Intersource, which will now be known as Intersource by Stark. Following the deal, the company’s showroom will remain in International Market Square, with plans to move into a new space in fall 2022. With both companies focusing on trade residential and commercial sales—specifically with a core client base of interior designers and specifiers—the acquisition allows both brands to expand their offerings through newly combined labor and resources. The move is Stark’s third buy of a regional floor-coverings company within the past year and a half—after the March 2021 purchase of New Jersey–based J&S Designer Flooring and the July 2021 purchase of Florida–based floor covering company Crystal Tree Carpet—and comes amid a period of growth that’s seen the company launch e-commerce venture Ashley Stark Home among other new collaborations and product offerings.

Builders are more backed up with projects now than they were a year ago, according to a new member survey conducted by Associated Builders and Contractors. The organization’s backlog indicator notched upward from 8.8 months in April to nine months in May—a projection that is up one month entirely from May 2021. Though they have plenty of work, contractors are losing some of their optimism. The survey indicated that confidence in future sales and staffing levels was declining slightly, and expectations around profit margin were taking a significant hit. According to ABC’s chief economist Anirban Basu, contractors will continue to face challenges surrounding the cost of delivering construction services due to the ongoing volatility of materials prices and supply chain delays—a factor that feeds into the survey’s less-than-ideal profit margin projection.

Habitat for Humanity International announced that it is dedicating more than $25 million in funding toward the goal of increasing the number of Black homeowners in the U.S., The Wall Street Journal reports. The nonprofit organization has set a goal of creating 3 million new Black homeowners by 2030 and will distribute funds to 1,100 local affiliates across the country. As part of the plan, Habitat for Humanity will also provide financial coaching to prospective homeowners and will back efforts to change laws in neighborhoods where multiunit homes are prohibited—a common obstacle for lower-income families seeking housing. According to chief executive officer Jonathan Reckford, the initiative is designed to target the historic and systemic discrimination preventing Black families from buying homes—in the first quarter of this year, the Black homeownership rate was 44.7 percent, while the white homeownership rate was 74 percent.

Rental costs are climbing quickly, rising by 5.2 percent in the year through May—a pace that’s keeping inflation high and making the transition to homeownership more difficult for renters, The New York Times reports. Since housing costs comprise a large part of the overall inflation index, they’re contributing to high prices even as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to tamp inflation down—as a result, the market is likely to remain stretched for the near future. “Rent growth and occupancy are off of Everest peak and back at base camp, but we’re still a long way from the sea,” Igor Popov, chief economist at listing site Apartment List, told the NYT.

Amazon has gone to great lengths to recruit influencers from TikTok and bring them on to its own selling platform, Insider reports, including offering various creators between $2,000 to $9,000 per month (on top of standard commission rates) to create content on its live shopping feature, Amazon Live. As the article outlines, making the jump to Amazon was challenging: According to leaked documents and the experiences of participating TikTok users who spoke under condition of anonymity, many found it difficult to draw audiences from their native platforms to Amazon and also disliked that they had to spend their own money on products they bought and promoted in the live videos, rather than Amazon covering the costs.

Etsy has announced the launch of a new Purchase Protection program for both buyers and sellers on its platform, TechCrunch reports. The new feature rolls out on August 1, making buyers on the online marketplace eligible for a full refund for purchases that don’t match their description, arrive damaged or don’t arrive at all. Additionally, the company announced plans to invest at least $25 million in a program that will cover refunds on behalf of sellers for qualifying orders of up to $250, at no additional cost to sellers. The news comes just a few months after more than 14,000 of the platform’s sellers went on strike following Etsy’s announcement that it would be increasing transaction fees from 5 percent to 6.5 percent. According to the company’s launch announcement, the Purchase Protection program was the result of feedback from buyers and sellers.

The High Point Market Authority has released its biannual Style Report, a compilation of product insights from Spring High Point Market compiled by the 2022 Style Spotters—a group of designers chosen to expound on their favorite findings for the report. This season’s report placed a heavy emphasis on products and brands focused on sustainability and craftsmanship, with findings split into three categories: Behind the Scenes offers a glimpse at the story behind a product or brand; On the Scene features stories centered around a style, product category or other aesthetic theme; and Must Be Seen celebrates a beloved product, collection or brand.

Vancouver–based home brand Sundays is now available in the U.S. Courtesy of Sundays

Vancouver–based home brand Sundays has launched its offerings in the U.S. Founded in 2019 by Moe Samieian Jr., Sara Samieian, Barbora Samieian and Noah Morse, the company’s direct-to-consumer furniture and home decor products function individually or together as a curated room collection, with an array suitable to the bedroom, living room, kitchen, outdoors and more.

Interior designer and collector Kelly Wearstler and designer Hagit Pincovici have teamed up for the launch of Third Nature—a line of collectible furniture, sculptures and objets d’art. The collection began with Pincovici’s desire to reconnect with nature during the pandemic, at which time she began collecting dead plants found in her urban neighborhood and casting them in bronze in her Milan studio. Together with Wearstler, the pair developed custom furniture and decor items inspired by Pincovici’s original bronze designs—sculptural objects for the home such as a bench, console, chair, mirror and sculpture, all of which draw influence from the geographic similarities of each of their hometown cities, Los Angeles and Tel Aviv, respectively.

Chez Laurence, the series hosted by circularity design expert Laurence Carr, will return to EarthxTV for its second season, debuting on June 18. This season, Carr will highlight companies and organizations in the built environment, architecture, furnishings and design-related industries that have incorporated circular processes to reduce their environmental impact. Interviewees will include CEOs and executives from companies such as Moore & Giles, Verellen and the Sustainable Furnishings Council.

Showhouses

The Kips Bay Decorator Show House Dallas has announced the location for its third annual designer showhouse, selecting a property at 9250 Meadowbrook Drive in Old Preston Hollow. The 12,470-square-foot single-family home includes five bedrooms, eight bathrooms, an elevator, a four-car garage, a pool house apartment and more. In September, the residence will open to the public for tours to benefit local charities Dwell with Dignity and The Crystal Charity Ball.

Paragon Textiles Finds Hot Used Clothing Markets,"Paragon Textiles is among those in the used clothing brokerage business, buying, sometimes repairing, then selling what thrift shops don’t want, and shipping them mainly to Africa and South America. At least that’s how Paragon Textiles CEO and owner Murtaza Haji got started in the 1990s, selling a few containers at a time.

Today the company works from a 42,000-square foot warehouse in Los Angeles, Calif. and procures, not just from secondhand shops, but also buys overstock and returns of a few retailers. Sometimes Paragon deals directly with the stores, and sometimes through brokers.

“We process and ship overseas to microentrepreneurs that start small clothing shops. Some leave their day jobs where they made the equivalent of a few hundred U.S. dollars a month. They realize they can buy product and make more money, selling one bale at a time,” Haji says.

The most ambitious small buyers and sellers earn up to thousands a month, according to Haji.

Paragon recycles, or else sells as wearable clothing, 97% of what it receives, most coming from thrift shops in roughly 40,000-pound bales; the Paragon team has no idea of what’s in them until they open them.

Paragon sorts it all, and it’s a complex process. First, workers separate in men’s’ ladies’, and children’s clothes, and by size, pulling out what’s not ripped or stained.

This usable clothing is the largest part of the mix and is what goes to the two main overseas markets. Some of the rest is cut into cleaning rags sold to U.S.-based companies that make wipers in bulk and supply them to end users. A small remainder is converted into other items, for instance unrepairable sweaters are shred and the fibers are used in India to make recycled yarn, clothes, or carpets.

Paragon’s gross revenue is only 20%, and it incurs 10 to 15% overhead expense.

“So, if we make 5 to 7%, that’s it. But it’s a comfortable living because of the volume,” Haji says.

He got his start when a cousin visiting him in LA from Congo in Africa propositioned him to find used clothing, sell, and ship to him overseas. Haji dabbled in unchartered territory, learning more from a friend with a clothing business in Canada who asked him for help finding LA suppliers of used clothes, and at the same time teaching Haji about the secondhand textiles market.

This was the start of a decades-long journey focused mainly on establishing and nurturing relationships to build a solid network.

“The first steps are to find a strong buyer in your overseas market and a good supplier with quality merchandise. You also need an established relationship with a freight forwarder who does transcontinental shipping,” he says.

Another key lesson in exports is you have to be diversified.

“There are a lot of ups and downs and political and economic instability in some of the regions where we work. But if business in one country is slow, we move product elsewhere.

And you have to find what’s in demand. Buyers pay ocean freight costs and duties, so you have to send what they want,” Haji says.

In his strongest market, that demand is for quality clothes—not raw materials or garments needing repair.

Paragon’s sister company, Casa de Ropa in Chile, warehouses what Paragon sends and distributes it to local microentrepreneurs, mainly women. Casa de Ropa helps them determine their target customers and recommends what they should buy.

“She takes bales home and might clean the clothes. She takes them to the flea market, displays and sells them,” Haji says.

Haji gambles sometimes in that if she seems serious, he sends her the product for a down payment, and almost always is paid back the balance.

“They are responsible and determined. So, we support her; slowly she grows. We no longer have to finance her because now she has a strong business. They come back and stay loyal because you put your neck out and trusted her, and now she is grateful to you,” Haji says.

Paragon’s model and merchandise work, he figures, because his brand represents America in the eyes of consumers. They see what intrigues them on social media and in Hollywood movies they watch on Netflix.

“What attracts them could be a t-shirt or other garment displaying a photo of Madonna or Michael Jordan, or the words “Nike” or “Florida … They love American fashion,” Haji says.

Born Primitive, a fitness apparel brand, sells overstock to Paragon at a deep discount.

“With Paragon’s help, we now have the ability to liquidate our inventory in a way that makes a positive social impact in less-privileged parts of the world, while also contributing to our company’s sustainability goals,” says Bear Handlon, owner and CEO of Born Primitive.

Paragon’s proposition struck a chord with Handlon, taking him back to an earlier day.

“We started our company out of our garage, and we went to countless events trying to sell t-shirts from a card table for the first few years. When I think about the people who will be purchasing our goods to make a profit for their own small businesses, it really comes full circle for me. They will essentially be doing what we did but in a totally different part of the world.”

Only recently has Handlon’s apparel business grown to the point where he is challenged to forecast precisely, and as a result ended up with overstock.

But overstock and return textiles inventory is common, especially for mid-sized and large retailers, where merchandise builds in their warehouses, often eventually making its way to landfills or getting burned.

“That's where we come in, giving another option, says Kay Litwin, Paragon Textiles manager of Partner Relations and Social Responsibility.

Paragon now retrieves about 10,000 to 20,000 pounds a month from a total of three retailers, which, like thrift shop finds, are shipped overseas. Litwin is trying to expand the retail end of the business – now only 5% of the mix – to build out Paragon’s model.

“Some people say, you are selling to these poor women? But for our overseas entrepreneurs, relying on donations would not be a long-term solution,” Litwin says.

“You need to assist countries in creating a sustainable economy rather than flood them with donations. Now these women can build a company and participate in a global market.”

What’s driven Haji?

“It’s like a two in one. As a private company if we do not make money, we can’t do what we are doing. But the beautiful thing is we are also doing a lot of good for the environment and helping entrepreneurs overseas.”",,[],[]
"Timmins holding household hazardous waste, textile collection","Single-use propane cylinders are just one of the many hazardous items the City of Timmins will collect during its annual household hazardous waste and textile collection event Saturday.

""You can’t really reuse those, so these are going to go where they should,"" said Marie-Eve Proulx, a resident who works to be eco-friendly.

During last year's collection, 54 tonnes of products that are unhealthy for the landfill were dropped off by residents, down from 70 tonnes the year before.

""It’s really important to bring these materials to be diverted properly and so that they’re either recycled into new materials or they’re properly brought into end of life, and so these materials don’t belong in our landfill. They don’t belong down the sanitary system because our wastewater facilities are not designed to treat these things,"" said Christina Beaton, the city's environmental coordinator.

Pesticides, batteries, electronics and paints are some of the other items that will be collected at the Archie Dillon Sportsplex on June 11 from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.

""If you're unsure about what you can bring and what we will accept, you can check out the Timmins Recycling waste wizard,"" Beaton said.

A total of 5,000 pounds of textiles were amassed also amassed last year and Proulx appreciates that she is not the only one who cares about planet earth.

How 3 Clothing Processers Are Reducing Textile Waste,"The clothing industry is a huge energy and water hog that accounts for about 4% of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions. While the slow fashion movement is starting to disrupt the industry, there is a dire need for ways to reduce textile waste. We identified three companies that are working to keep textiles out of landfills.

FABSCRAP: Collecting & Recycling Pre-consumer Textiles

Fabscrap processes pre-consumer fabric in the New York City and Philadelphia fashion industries. The company works with designers and entertainment companies to recycle and reuse fabric waste from the design process. This is a very small part of the waste associated with the clothing industry, says company founder Jessica Schreiber. But her company is not big enough to handle textile waste from the manufacturing process.

After Fabscrap picks up textile waste from its customers, volunteers sort it into the following categories: landfill waste, fabric that can be upcycled, or fabric that must be downcycled. Schreiber stressed that most textile waste is downcycled into shoddy. (Shoddy is low-quality material that manufacturers use for mattress stuffing, insulating, carpet padding, and other non-clothing purposes.)

Schreiber explains that most fabric consists of blended materials, in other words, a mix of synthetic and natural fibers. Because it’s too difficult to separate those fibers, clothing made of blended material is likely to be downcycled. Unless the fabric is made of a single fiber type, such as 100% cotton, it’s very hard to recycle old clothing into new clothing.

Fabscrap picks up 5,000 to 6,000 pounds of textile waste weekly, or approximately 260,000 pounds annually, and has over 8,000 volunteers to help with sorting. The company rewards volunteers with 5 pounds of fabric per work session. Fabscrap sells reusable fabric in its physical stores in New York City and Philadelphia.

Goodwill: Reusing Clothing Directly & Recycling the Rest

Goodwill Industries is a worldwide nonprofit organization that helps people improve their lives through job training, employment opportunities, and more. Some local Goodwill chapters also provide hot meals, financial literacy training, and childcare. You may be most familiar with the nonprofit through its regional thrift stores that sell inexpensive used clothing and home goods.

In 2020, the regional Goodwill Chapter of Greater Cleveland and East Central Ohio helped more than 819,000 people. It also deferred 18 million pounds of goods donated to its Goodwill stores from landfills. Four million pounds of those goods Goodwill either dedicated to an aftermarket program or recycled.

If clothing items don’t sell at a Goodwill store, the nonprofit offers them at its outlet stores where it sells textiles by the bin at just $1.59 per pound. Textiles that don’t sell at this second market are sorted into categories — rags, clothing, or linens — and baled. The aftermarket retailers who buy these bales often send the material to other countries where they are used to manufacture shoddy or downcycled into rags.

The Goodwill staff that we talked to stated that Goodwill prefers donations of undamaged textiles that it can sell in its stores. However, Goodwill does have this multi-step process to avoid the waste of any usable textiles.

ForDays: Circular Economy Fashion & Collecting Unwanted Clothing

Sustainable clothing brand ForDays works hard to close the textile waste loop by selling zero-waste clothing and accepting clothes for recycling.

ForDays reuses all of its manufacturing fabric waste in new ForDays clothing. The company also recycles the used ForDays clothing that customers return. It becomes fabric that ForDays uses to create new clothing collections. In addition, the company accepts clothing from any brand in any condition. To donate clothing, purchase a $20 Take Back Bag, fill it with clothing, and receive the $20 back as credit towards your next ForDays purchase.

ForDays clothing is zero waste because it is designed to be recycled. It is 100% organic cotton with minimal elastic and is easy to disassemble for recycling. When the company receives donated clothing made of blended material, it sells the fabric to manufacturers to make shoddy.

“At ForDays, we strongly believe that all fashion businesses must take responsibility for what happens to clothes after our customers love them and wear through them,” says ForDays CEO Kristy Caylor. “Our goal at ForDays was to figure out how to make participation in the circular economy an easy, seamless, and rewarding experience for all fashion lovers.”

Currently, ForDays accepts clothing for recycling only from the United States. The company has plans to expand the recycling program into Europe

How Consumers Can Help Reduce Textile Waste

While these are just a few of the many approaches that communities and companies can take to reduce textile waste, consumers must play a part too. Each of us can strive to buy secondhand, which means we are giving textiles a second chance. We can also reduce our overall clothing consumption and only purchase items we know we’ll wear many times. We can support sustainable clothing brands, buy quality clothing made of natural fibers, and care for it properly so it will last.

The rise of the ‘guiltwashers’,"At the beginning of this century, life in the world of textiles was simple but concerning. Production was growing, consumption was expanding, and globalisation was happening at an alarming pace, with almost all textiles made using conventional methods with little focus on hazardous chemicals or water and energy consumption.

And then, when a few enlightened individuals extrapolated what impact this ‘business-as-usual’ would have on the planet, we saw the birth of the ecotextiles movement.

Initially, there was a common cause, as those who wanted to avert escalating negative impacts sought to find lower impact alternatives and there was a collective understanding that our industry had to either reduce production volumes or negative impacts per unit to slow or reverse environmental damage.",,[],"['Phil Patterson', 'Friday', 'Thursday', 'Wednesday', 'Monday']"
"Mitumba trade is merely ‘waste colonialism’, Greenpeace insists","By John Kamau More by this Author

When Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu launched a county government-run apparel factory, she got orders to make uniforms for chiefs and assistant chiefs.

While Kitui County Textile Centre also made face masks during the Covid-19 pandemic, a new report says East African countries are being coerced into accepting used clothes rather than grow their industries.

Confronting what Greenpeace calls “waste colonialism”, and which in East Africa comes in the form of mitumba trade, has become tricky – and the reason Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition party presidential candidate Raila Odinga had to “clarify” what he meant when he appeared to bad-mouth the business.

Greenpeace recently visited Kenya where its researchers found a horrifying picture.

“Vendors at Gikomba market in Nairobi told me they are often disappointed when they open the bales because nearly half of the clothes are unusable. Their quality is poor, or they are broken or soiled and are nothing more than textile waste,” said Viola Wohlgemuth, a circular economy and toxics campaigner at Greenpeace Germany.

Before Kenya became one of the dumping sites of western-generated second-hand clothes, the debate over mitumba would have probably been nationalistic.

Greenpeace, an international lobby, is now raising its voice and arguing that textile waste is often disguised as second-hand clothing and exported from the Global North to the Global South, to avoid the responsibility and costs of dealing with the problem of disposable wear.

“While these exported used clothes and even brand new overproduced ones are mostly reported and recorded as ‘reused’, nearly half of them end up in dumpsites, rivers or are burnt in the open,” the lobby says.

Before the liberalisation of the markets in the late 80s, thanks to the push by the US for African economies to implement James Baker’s free-market plan, the textile industry – though struggling – was still vibrant.

The thinking then was that developing countries would only achieve growth by adopting free market policies.

But this opened floodgates as cheap second-hand clothes found their way into the market, killing the entire textile sector.

About 85 per cent of Kenya’s textile industries closed shop by the mid-1990s.

And Kenya is not alone. Some of Africa’s major producers of cotton – Mali, Burkina Faso, Chad, Togo and Uganda – now have thriving second-hand markets and no garment industries.

Mitumba business is regarded as an avenue by western nations to offload their waste into developing countries – which all end up in dumpsites.

Greenpeace, in a report titled “Poisoned Gifts” says: “With mitumba continuing to drive the demand for used clothes, this has been at expense of locally made products and local textile industries.”

But the main poser is that most of the second-hand clothes sent to Africa are waste. At Gikomba market, it is normal to find waste disguised as clothes.

Greenpeace says between 30 and 40 per cent of mitumba is of such bad quality that it cannot be sold. This means 55,500 to 74,000 tonnes of it is textile waste. This amounts to 150–200 tonnes of textile waste a day.

But banning the second-hand clothes is still difficult, especially for nations on the continent which signed the African Growth and Opportunities Act (Agoa) in order to penetrate the American market.

Agoa, a brainchild of former US President George W Bush, was initially marketed as a scheme to enable countries in Sub-Sahara to export textiles to America.

Attempts to stop the offloading of used American garments to Africa have been followed by bullying since part of the Agoa deal is that the countries could export new clothes to the US and in return allow Washington to export back used clothes.

While donation is said to prevent surplus clothing from going to landfills in western countries, the second-hand clothing business is also believed to be disrupting the emergence of budding textile industries in developing countries.

When Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania attempted to stop the importation of second-hand clothes and apparel from the US in 2015, the Donald Trump administration issued an ultimatum on February 23, 2018 in which they were bullied to rescind the decision or face new tariffs.

Pressure had initially come from United States Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles (SMART) Association, a group of 40 used clothing exporters.

“The move to curb incoming used clothing is a barrier to US trade, which goes against certain requirements under Agoa,” the group argued.

It added that the move threatened 40,000 sorting and packing jobs in America.

As a follow-up, the Office of the US Trade Representative threatened to remove four of the six East African countries included in the Agoa Act.

While Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania backed out under pressure – after a meeting held in Kampala – Rwanda refused and introduced a tariff of $4 per kilo on imports of used clothing in 2018.

Washington responded by putting tariffs of 30 per cent on Rwandan clothing. Rwanda stopped further imports form the US and started building its textile sector.

“We are put in a situation we have to choose. You choose to be a recipient of used clothes or choose to grow our textile industries. Making the choice is simple,” Rwandan President Paul Kagame said.

In one of its brochures, SMART justifies the export of used clothes.

“Clothing and household textiles make up 6.3 per cent of the waste stream or the equivalent of 81 pounds per person thrown away annually in the US. Nearly 95 per cent of used clothing and textiles can be reused and recycled. You can help reduce the amount of clothing and textile products going into landfills by reusing or recycling these materials,” it says.

While it adds that recycling textiles saves the environment from tonnes of harsh chemicals, Africa has no recycle capacity and they all end up in the continent’s landfills.

SMART also argues that textile industries in developing countries “can make more money producing clothing for export to wealthier nations in Europe and North America than selling them locally”.

While Rwanda refused to be bullied by the US, the world’s largest exporter of used clothing, it is Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania which continued to be the mitumba outlets.

The trade is organised by charities and organisations that collect the clothes – mostly for free – and sell them in their shops.

The funds, ostensibly, are used to help the poor. Yet, the same donations are later sold in bulk to wholesalers and exporters, killing industries in developing nations.

It has turned into a multimillion-dollar business.

Years ago, Prof Anyang Nyong’o – current Kisumu governor – warned Kenyans against accepting used clothes.

“When new clothes are expensive because our import substitution industries are high cost, and cannot produce clothes cheap enough for our workers, there is a tendency for us to rationalise the situation and say: ‘Let us import second hand clothes cheap enough for wage earners’,” Prof Nyong’o said.

“This is a false argument. We need to make it very cheap for those in textile industries to import the latest state-of-the-art technology in the making of textiles which will cheapen production per unit.”

Greenpeace says some mitumba sent to Africa have no value and end up as waste.

“Either they are not adequate, sizes that don’t fit, or not useful due to the local climate, their quality is poor, or they are broken or soiled and exporting is just a cheap way to get rid of them,” it says.

There is no data on how many bales of clothes contain waste but traders encounter them all the time.

According to the Greenpeace report, an estimated 40 per cent are of such poor quality that hey are deemed worthless on arrival, ending up in landfills.

“The Global North undoubtedly has a waste problem and is perpetuating a legacy of waste colonialism,” Greenpeace says.

5 Key Takeaways From The 2022 Global Fashion Summit In Copenhagen,"After two years online, the Global Fashion Summit – which sees key industry figures meeting to drive forward fashion’s sustainability efforts – returned in-person at Copenhagen’s Royal Opera House this week. Previously known as the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, the new rebranding reflects the increased ambition level of the event.

“We want to make a bigger impact, accelerate the impact and the only way [to do that] is to go together,” Federica Marchionni, CEO of the Global Fashion Agenda, the non-profit behind the summit, tells Vogue, pointing to this year’s theme, ‘Alliances For A New Era’. “I hope we’re giving an example to the industry on how we can cooperate, and that more alliances are made to tackle specific actions.”

With major players including Gucci-owner Kering, Burberry and Nike in attendance alongside representatives from the United Nations Fashion Industry Charter For Climate Action and other NGOs, the summit represented an opportunity to tackle difficult subjects and discuss what still needs to be done to achieve a more sustainable future for the industry.

Below, see five key takeaways from this year’s Global Fashion Summit.

Shein’s new $50 million fund to tackle clothing waste proved controversial

While alliances may have been the theme of the summit, an unexpected agreement between Shein and The OR Foundation proved to be the biggest talking point. There was an audible gasp in the room when Liz Ricketts, co-founder of the non-profit that works with the community at Kantamanto Market in Accra, Ghana – the biggest second-hand clothing market in west Africa – would be receiving $15 million from the ultra fast fashion brand as part of its new $50 million fund to tackle clothing waste.

Many at the summit considered it an extreme case of greenwashing, although it raised questions over whether fast fashion brands should be paying for the devastating environmental impact they’re causing. “If Shein is willing to say that they do play a role in this and give money to clean it up – I don’t know who else should pay,” Ricketts later said.

More voices need to be included in the conversation

A running theme of the conference was the need for more voices to be included in the conversation, particularly when it comes to those who work within fashion’s supply chain in the Global South. “We need to work with the supply chain; their voices need to be heard, manufacturers’ voices need to be heard,” Nikhil Hirdaramani, director of apparel manufacturer the Hirdaramani Group, commented.

Legislation is coming

Another key topic was the importance of legislation that’s coming down the pipeline in accelerating change. The EU launched a draft of its Textiles Strategy earlier this year, which includes a mandatory extended producer responsibility scheme that would make brands legally responsible for their textiles waste, while a new Fashion Act, which would force brands to commit to Science-Based Targets and disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, as well as their energy, water, material and plastic usage and chemical management, was proposed in New York in January.",,[],"['Condé Nast', 'Emily Chan']"
Recycling Itself Cannot Fix the Plastics Issue,"The Royal Statistical Society (RSS) in England announced in December 2018 that the winning International Statistic of the year was 90.5%. This number represents the proportion of plastic waste that had never been recycled based on a paper titled, “Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made.” RSS executive director Hetan Shah stated that the statistics captured the zeitgeist of 2018. If anything, the statistic on plastic appears to have captured an ever-increasing concern about plastic waste.

Only 9.5% was recycled?

This global figure is poorly understood. It does not distinguish between countries. Despite that, the current U.S. plastic recycling number is coincidentally close to the 9%. The global figure also does not distinguish between types of plastic --- whether it’s a plastic beverage bottle or a cell phone case or a bike helmet. Instead, it is a calculation of all plastic that has been generated since 1950, or 8300 million metric tons (Mt). From that number, it subtracts the amount that is still in use, or 2500 Mt as well the amount that was were discarded or incinerated, or 5700 Mt. It also states that about 600 Mt were recycled.

At first glance, the numbers do not add up. If a total of 8300 Mt generated and 5700 Mt was discarded or incinerated and 2500 Mt is still in use, that only leaves 100 Mt unaccounted for, not 600 Mt. This discrepancy can be explained because plastics cannot be recycled endlessly. Depending on the source, plastic can be recycled as many as ten times or as few as 2-3 times. Of the 600 Mt of plastic that was ever recycled, most of it has since been discarded or incinerated.

Further, most plastic packaging is not recycled into the same product. For example, in the U.S., only a small amount of PET is recycled into food and beverage bottles. The primary end market is fiber. Similarly, less than half of HDPE is recycled into bottles. Pipe, lumber, lawn/garden and other outlets take the remainder of the recycled HDPE. Given that, while still conserving resources, much of plastic recycling is not circular.

What is plastic waste in the U.S.?

More recent reporting questions whether recycling is even at 9%. The Last Beach Cleanup estimated that 5-6% of plastic is recycled. Given that the public wants to recycle more packaging, this figure can be disheartening. However, it should be put into context because plastic is more than just packaging and yet most people only think about packaging.

Of plastic wastes, about 38% was in durable goods. EPA defines durable good as products with a lifetime of three years or more. This includes items such as appliances, furniture, carpets, consumer electronics, sports equipment and luggage.

Another 21% was in nondurable goods. Nondurable goods are products with a lifetime less than three years – but not packaging. Nondurable goods includes plastic plates, cups and cutlery; disposable diapers; clothing and footwear; and trash bags. Disposable diapers and trash bags are unlikely to be recycled anytime soon. In looking at textiles, EPA found that significant amounts were reused but those numbers were not included in either the generation of waste or the recycling figures.

The last 40% of plastic waste was containers and packaging. Containers and packaging is what we generally consider to be recyclables. The container and packaging recycling rate is higher at 13.6% according to the EPA with PET and natural HDPE bottles topping the recycling rate at about 29%.

Is it recyclable?

While plastic bottles are almost always recyclable in the curbside bin, confusion stems from messaging about other plastics. The public is often directly to their local municipality to obtain information about what can be recycled. The following chart shows what the largest cities in the U.S. accept.

Bottles & jars Rigid caps & lids Rigid plastic food containers Rigid plastic non-food containers Rigid plastic house-wares Bulk rigid plastics New York City X X X X X X Los Angeles X X X X Chicago X X X Houston X X X X Phoenix X X X X Philadelphia X X X X

But given the limited attention spans, most people access recycling information from labels on packaging. Unfortunately, the recycling symbol, characterized by a triangle of chasing arrows, which is useful for paper and cans instead causes additional confusion with plastic. Rather than using the recycling symbol to indicate that a material is recyclable, plastic packaging uses a resin identification code (RIC) with numbers ranging from one to seven. Because the public understands the recycling symbol for paper and cans, they often mistakenly assume that the symbol indicates that the packaging can be recycled in their curbside bin.

However, eliminating the RIC from plastic packaging is not easy. Many states require the RIC to be on packaging. This is slowly changing with Washington, Oregon and California changing requirements in 2021.

Plastics in the environment

Part of the reason for plastic waste representing the zeitgeist of our time is that people are disturbed by how frequently plastic is found in the environment and the attendant harm it may cause. Twenty years ago, Bangladesh became the first country to ban single use plastic bags after they were found to exacerbate flooding by clogging up the drainage infrastructure. South Africa, where the plastic bag was facetiously dubbed the “national flower,” quickly followed. In total, 94 countries now have plastic bag bans and another 54 have imposed taxes, partial bans or other restrictions on plastic bags.

A significant portion of the plastic that is improperly managed can make its way into the ocean. Reports suggest that up to 2.75 Mt of plastic waste is dumped into the oceans annually from rivers around the world with eight rivers in Asia and two in Africa representing 93% of the total.

Awareness of plastic in the marine environment continues to rise. In 2009, Oprah Winfrey hosted Fabien Cousteau, grandson of the famed ocean explorer, Jacques Cousteau discussing the great Pacific garbage patch, formed by ocean currents, consisting mainly of plastic debris. And Blue Planet II, narrated by David Attenborough, highlighted the problems with ocean debris showing animals directly affected by exposure to plastics.

Compared to other materials, plastic is the primary material in the environment. According to the Ocean Conversancy’s beach cleanup data for 2020, plastic makes up the vast majority of material taking up seven of the top ten spots. Plastic grocery bags takes the 6th spot and straws and stirrers, a frequently banned item, takes the 7th spot. Plastic beverage bottles (#2) and plastic bottles caps (#5) would exceed cigarette butts (#1) if taken together. Seeing plastic in the environment triggers outrage in the public and a strong desire to rectify the situation.

And increasingly, the public is finding out that what goes around comes around. Research indicates that people are consuming up to five grams of microplastics each week through water, shellfish, beer, salt and other foods. This has been compared to ingesting approximately a credit card’s worth of plastic every week.

Plastic exports

Many of the countries that contribute to ocean plastics were destinations for plastic recyclables from the U.S. Given that processing recyclables is anticipated to result in some material loss, concerns rose that this material could enter the environment. Environmental organizations pressured U.S. waste management companies to stop exporting plastics recyclables. Most made commitments to end plastic exports from North America. However, Canada and Mexico are still common destinations.

Looking beyond recycling

Manufacturers select plastic packaging over other materials for a variety of reasons. Plastic is flexible and lightweight and inexpensive. These factors may provide environmental benefits that are more important than recycling. Environmental factors include such things as climate change implications, acidification, and water consumption.

In 2020, Sphera conducted a life cycle analysis for Ball Corporation of common beverage containers to evaluate which had the best environmental footprint. In comparing multiple environmental impacts, the non-carbonated PET bottle had the lowest impact. Should these factors outweigh recycling when considering packaging?

What is the solution to preventing plastics from entering the environment?

To protect the environment, a multi-prong approach is necessary to deal with plastics. Recycling alone cannot prevent plastics from entering the environment. And keeping plastics out of the environment is more important than recycling.

Just like with plastic bag bans, many organizations are reconsidering the necessity of plastic products. The U.S. Plastics Pact developed a list of problematic and unnecessary materials which members have committed to take measures to eliminate by 2025. These include non-reusable, non-recyclable, non-compostable plastic cutlery, stirrers and straws, PVC, polystyrene, black plastics and plastics with PFAS.

For plastics that continue to be made, efforts can be focused on making plastic recycling more circular. Minimum content mandates for plastic packaging helps maintain the circularity of the material. California’s AB793 from 2020 does this in a tiered fashion starting this year with a 15% requirement. In 2025, the requirement jumps to 25% and in 2030, it jumps again to 50%. Similarly, New Jersey’s new minimum content law passed earlier this year requiring recycled content of 10% by 2024. And earlier this year, the Northeast Recycling Council (NERC) shared a draft model legislation for minimum content. These efforts will increase demand, pulling recyclable plastic into circularity, rather than the alternative markets that are currently prevalent.

But recycling, by itself, cannot fix the issues. As noted, even if recycled, plastic cannot be endlessly recycled. When it reaches its end of life, it will need to be managed appropriately to keep it out of the environment. Environmentally sound solid waste management systems need to be supported to ensure the protection of our oceans and ecology. Until the other 90.5% of plastics can be recycled, waste-to-energy and landfills are necessary to protect our oceans.",,[],[]
"FibreTrace, Säntis Textiles partner on global traceable fibre technology","FibreTrace hopes its new partnership with global company Säntis Textiles will enable it to become the leading physical and digital transparency solution for recycled and circular textile solutions.

Meanwhile, Säntis Textiles plans to use the partnership to develop a unique traceable ID for its RCO100 fibres, yarns, and fabrics. The RCO100 technology works by taking pre-consumer industrial waste and post-consumer cotton garment waste to produce 100% recycled cotton yarns without the use of chemical processes or regenerated fibres.

The collaboration is said to be rooted in both companies’ approach to delivering quality and integrity at scale, to future proof supply chains and to provide the end-consumer with the chance to choose a transparent and sustainable supply chain.

Säntis Textiles creative director Annabelle Hutter explained: “With an increased appetite from brands around the globe wanting to adopt more circular approaches, we are keen to support ongoing steps towards enhancing the longevity of the industry as well as the planet for the greater good of future generations. A core part of our growth strategy is developing fibre tracing technology for our one-of-a-kind recycling technology, RCO100, so we’re delighted to be working with FibreTrace who are leaders in this field to help to develop this. This project, alongside many others, are going to help shape the future of textile circular solutions.”

Ambitious policy makes California a crucible for investments in organics collection and recycling,"Listen to the article 13 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Editor’s note: This is the first in a multipart series exploring the market effects of California’s sweeping organic waste reduction law, SB 1383.

California has enacted its most ambitious waste policy in decades, SB 1383, and the results could have implications for how organic waste is collected and managed far beyond the state.

SB 1383 is a key component of the state’s effort to mitigate short-lived climate pollutants such as methane. To do so, California's Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) is requiring a 75% reduction in organic waste disposal by 2025. The lengthy regulations underpinning these targets contain numerous complex provisions around newer efforts such as procurement and edible food recovery. But the most visible change is already occurring along curbs and alleys throughout the state, as local jurisdictions must now facilitate comprehensive organics collection for all residents and businesses.

The organics collection and processing requirements of SB 1383 are an immense undertaking, with CalRecycle in 2018 — prior to the current inflationary environment — estimating the policy could cost potentially $20.9 billion in the 12-year period leading up to 2030. At the same time, the agency anticipated a potential $17 billion economic benefit and thousands of new jobs created over that period.

All told, it’s estimated the state will need to keep 27 million tons of organics from going to disposal annually by 2025, and 18 million tons of that is not eligible for edible food recovery. The pandemic hasn’t helped local jurisdictions’ efforts, leading Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign a bill last year providing some leeway in the enforcement process.

The onus of this law falls on local governments, and the law imposes hefty financial penalties for noncompliance. Many local jurisdictions are having to implement double-digit rate increases to pay for new or expanded collection programs and new infrastructure. Even Bay Area cities with more established collection programs are still working to catch up with all of the law’s requirements. Jurisdictions are weighing choices about collection and processing that will stick with them for years to come. The need for hauling and recycling solutions has also kicked off major changes throughout the California waste and recycling industry.

Over the past year, Waste Dive has spoken with dozens of waste and recycling professionals, state and local officials, and other stakeholders to learn what SB 1383 will mean for them.

Companies have been investing many millions of dollars into composting infrastructure, anaerobic digesters, pre-processing equipment and more to meet the requirements of new or amended contracts. Sensing a shift in the competitive landscape, some owners have sold their waste businesses to larger competitors or taken on new investors to better position themselves, while other composters and waste companies are entering the California market for the first time thanks to new contracts.

Through it all, CalRecycle and the law’s supporters have maintained strong optimism that not only can this be done in their state, but, if successful, it can spread to other parts of the U.S. and be adopted by national waste companies that have not yet scaled organics recycling up to its full potential.

“We are going to be the business case. We are going to be the case that proves this,” said CalRecycle Director Rachel Machi Wagoner. “They will take this other places if they see it making money for them. It has to be proven out first.”

By the numbers 20% Amount of California’s methane produced by organics in landfills 2020 Target date to reduce organic waste disposal by 50% from a 2014 baseline (not achieved) 2025 Target date to reduce organic waste disposal by 75% and increase edible food recovery by 20%

The climate case for reducing organics waste

California waste and recycling professionals are accustomed to adapting to an ever-growing list of new state laws. AB 939 of 1989 set a 50% waste reduction target by 2000, kicking off a wave of curbside recycling and yard waste programs. More recently, AB 1826 of 2014 mandated commercial organics collection, and AB 1594 of 2014 eliminated the option of counting as diversion the use of green waste for alternative daily cover in landfills.

Still, SB 1383 is considered among the state's most substantial waste policies in decades due to the speed of its enactment, the urgency policymakers feel in addressing climate issues and the complexity of what’s being required. While a variety of state and local organics recycling policy drivers already exist around the country, this will be the first mandatory statewide push outside of Vermont, which has less than 2% of California’s population.

The law, signed by then-Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016, originally looked for a 40% reduction in methane levels from a 2013 baseline by 2030, among other targets. Data from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory — collected for the California Air Resources Board from 2016 to 2018— found landfills were the largest methane emitters in the state. While debate continues in the waste industry about the most accurate way to measure these emissions, it’s become increasingly clear to certain state and federal policymakers that keeping organics out of landfills is a climate priority.

A recent report from the U.S. EPA (which has its own nonbinding food waste reduction goal) said keeping organic waste out of landfills can have a direct effect on mitigating climate change, given that more than 15% of human-related methane emissions in 2019 came from landfills, and methane is many times more potent than carbon dioxide as a mechanism for trapping heat in the atmosphere.

In addition to potential economic benefits, CalRecycle has also estimated the potential methane reductions driven by the law could be worth $40 million to $100 million per year in 2030, if not more. Overall health benefits to the state's residents could be worth at least $4.8 billion from 2019 to 2025, or potentially even greater based on a more recent report.

In California, the state estimates that “organics like food scraps, yard trimmings, paper, and cardboard” are about half of inbound landfill volume. The latest state reporting shows an estimated 52% of the 77.4 million tons of waste generated during 2020 ended up in landfills, with an estimated 12% of the overall amount managed via composting, anaerobic digestion or mulching.

Thus, to achieve the state’s methane reduction goals, SB 1383 mandates the collection and recycling of organic materials in addition to preliminary reduction and food recovery efforts.

Two paths to compliance

The SB 1383 regulations allow two approaches to meeting these organics collection requirements. The first is source-separated collection across three color-coded bins (gray for residual waste, blue for recyclables, green for yard and food waste). The second is mixed waste collection, where organics are commingled with MSW and possibly recyclables in one or two bins. While CalRecycle is still reviewing data about which approach each jurisdiction is planning to take, Machi Wagoner and many others say the three-bin system is far and away the most common choice.

Nick Lapis, director of advocacy with SB 1383 backer Californians Against Waste, said it’s “not accidental” that source-separated collection programs such as the one in San Francisco were the inspiration for this policy and are generally considered the easiest way to comply.

“The regulations allow mixed waste, but I cannot imagine any mixed waste system realistically meeting the requirements,” said Lapis, whose group specifically hoped to see mixed-waste collection banned. “The point of the bill was to set up source-separated composting programs around the state. There are pathways to compliance through mixed waste, but it’s intentionally a high hurdle.”

Machi Wagoner and others at CalRecycle say the regulation does not favor one approach or the other, but they note source separation is a more “proven” approach, with more compatible processing infrastructure and the potential to produce higher-quality commodities. Yet some believe collecting mixed waste that's processed to recover recyclable and organic materials is key to achieving SB 1383’s big-picture disposal reduction and climate targets.

“If you really want to make a dent, I think mixed-waste processing has to be part of this equation,” said Eugene Tseng, an environmental engineer, attorney and teacher who thinks all options in the waste management hierarchy need to be utilized. “They're never going to achieve that 75% goal with only source separation.”

Citing the broader list of target materials in the regulations — “food, green material, landscape and pruning waste, organic textiles and carpets, lumber, wood, paper products, printing and writing paper, manure, biosolids, digestate, and sludges [from the mixed waste stream]” — Tseng views some form of mixed waste sorting as inevitable if the law’s targets are going to be fully achieved.

Those taking the mixed waste approach must send material to a verified “high diversion organic waste processing facility” that has to prove a 75% recovery rate by 2025. CalRecycle said no list of designated high-diversion facilities is currently available, but so far, only a handful in the state are expected to qualify.

“What we are really looking for is [for] these new technologies to demonstrate success, and if they can demonstrate success, they can be part of our system,” said Zoe Heller, deputy director of policy development at CalRecycle.

Recyclers and local officials throughout the state have a wide variety of opinions on the best collection and processing methods for meeting the law’s mandates, and it appears likely to remain an ongoing discussion. In the meantime, at least one thing is clear: Achieving the organics diversion goals statewide may be among the local industry’s most complex tasks yet.

How much will organics processing need to grow?

As California’s jurisdictions and haulers ramp up their efforts to collect organics, one key question is where all that material will go.

The state already has a more robust organics processing infrastructure than many others due to decades of green waste composting and several well-established municipal food scrap programs. Jurisdictions are due to file capacity reports to CalRecycle in August, but existing data and interviews reveal differing opinions on whether the current infrastructure can accommodate the significant growth expected in organics collection and the additional complications that are predicted to come with that growth.

Some estimates indicate California may see as many as “90-110 new or expanded in-state recycling and remanufacturing facilities,"" beyond the current network of facilities, in order to achieve the law’s goals. The potential shortfall in processing is greatest in the southern part of the state, where dozens of new facilities are likely needed.

“One of the characteristics of organic waste is that it can’t be exported [long distances effectively]. We’re forced to have to process it in the state. So it’s monumental, as far as the change that’s going to be needed statewide for us to be able to successfully divert this material and process it into these organic products,” said Heller.

This expectation has driven interest and investment in a range of new capacity options, with many people looking for more in the future, but others anticipate that capacity at existing organics processing facilities will be sufficient.

In 2019, Matt Cotton — principal and owner of Integrated Waste Management Consulting — published a report for CalRecycle that found plenty of processing options for the expected volumes of organics SB 1383 will generate. At the time, the report found more than 160 permitted composting facilities and more than a dozen anaerobic digestion facilities accepting about 6 million tons of material, with existing permitted capacity for roughly another 4 million tons.

While the need has grown since that time, as more communities start up programs, more facilities have also come online, and Cotton remains optimistic about current availability. In his report, and since then, Cotton has also sought to dispel the notion that jurisdictions can’t ramp up their collection efforts due to a lack of capacity. He has found that organics recyclers are willing to invest in expanding permitted capacity when they have more guaranteed feedstock, and he said a key consideration is how far jurisdictions are willing to send their material and how much effort they want to put toward finding a solution.

“If every single jurisdiction aggressively went after 1383 [collection programs], we’d have a capacity shortage,” said Cotton, “but that’s not how it’s going to happen.”

The Fight Against Food Waste — Malibu Magazine,"Organic Waste Defined

The City’s Municipal Code defines “Organic Waste” as solid waste containing material originated from living organisms and their metabolic waste products, including food, green material, landscape, and pruning waste in addition to organic textiles and carpets, lumber, wood, paper products, printing and writing paper and manure, as well as biosolids and digestates.

The new law states that grocery stores must participate in an edible food recovery program by 2022, diverting up to a quarter of disposed-of edibles to food banks, while restaurants greater than 5,000 square feet in size and large events must comply with the requirements by 2024. It also requires cities to purchase products such as compost and mulch to create new markets for organic waste byproducts. Finally, it mandates that CalRecycle, the state agency overseeing organic waste recycling, adopt regulations including requirements aimed at meeting a minimum goal of 20 percent of edible food that is currently thrown away be recovered for human consumption by 2025.

How Organic Waste Recycling Works in Malibu

Public Works oversees the Malibu Garbage Disposal District (GDD) which covers portions of the City of Malibu and County incorporated territory. All properties within the GDD are automatically enrolled for services and property owners pay service fees as part of their annual property taxes. The waste hauler for the Malibu GDD is Universal Waste System.

The current service fee for basic service is $180 per refuse unit per year. The service level and the amount charged is based on the land use codes assigned to the property by the Los Angeles County Assessor, with one refuse unit equivalent to a single-family home.

Answers to Common Customer Questions Concerning Organic Recycling

Where do citizens place organic waste?

In the current green recycling cart. Customers should place all yard and food waste in the same container that they use for yard waste. “As part of the outreach and education, we prefer to have all recyclables and food waste/yard waste placed in the carts lose and not bagged,” said Denise Kane, Public Sector Solutions specialist for Waste Management.

How do customers get food waste from the kitchen to the disposal cart?

“Utilize a portable, reusable container with a tight fitting lid to collect kitchen food scraps. It can be plastic, metal or ceramic,” Kane said.

What about odors caused by organic recycling?

“If you are concerned about odors – baking soda is a great option,” Kane explained. She suggested that customers follow these 3 easy steps. 1) Fill a reusable container - sprinkle the container lightly with baking soda to absorb odors – then fill and store where it works best. 2) Empty contents into your green organics cart prior to service. 3) Rinse & Repeat – sprinkle lightly with baking soda to absorb any residual odors.

Are residents’ bills going to increase because of the Organic Waste Disposal Program?

“There is always a chance for rate variables that include inflation and cost of doing business,” Kane said.

How will the organic products be recycled?

Recycling of the organic waste will be managed by the County to render compost and renewable natural gas, Kane said.

Can I request a waiver?

Commercial businesses and multi-family property owners may request waivers from the City of Malibu if any of the following apply: 1) Legitimate and cost-prohibitive space constraints. 2) Organics (green waste and food waste) are managed on-site",,[],['Holly Bieler']

‘80% of textile in dry waste can be repaired or reused if collected separately’All these years, many of us used to dispose of our clothes — they either end up in aor are sold again to the poor.Now, a new initiative has been launched to make better use of used clothes so as to reduce the burden on landfills and ensure such clothes reach the poor free of cost.Hasiru Dala’s used clothes collection drive is on atand JP Nagar wards on a pilot basis. Residents are seemingly happy to handover old clothes tovolunteers who visit their homes twice a month.“It is a very good initiative. It ensures old clothes reach the needy or recyclers, not the landfills along with all types of waste. I am very happy to handover old clothes to Hasiru Dala volunteers,’’ saidV, a resident of Domlur.According to Hasiru Dala volunteers, about 4-6% of all collected dry waste in the city is textile waste.“A 2018 study by Hasiru Dala showed more than 80% of all textile waste in the dry waste collection system can be repaired or reused if collected separately, preventing it from ending up in landfills and open dumpsites,’’ saidHasiru Dala.The used textile collection project aims at reducing the quantity of cloth waste that ends up in the landfills.“We are doing this by setting up a separate collection and sorting system for textiles instead of collecting it with daily dry waste, to be able to get better quality textiles that are soiled by getting mixed with the regular dry waste collection. This allows us to find places where repairable and reusable clothes can find a new life; collecting regularly in large quantities will also help us talk to recyclers and cloth aggregators to take the non-reusable clothes collected in this manner,’’ he said.He noted that the project leverages existing(DWCCs) and their connection within wards to set up the collection system. “Citizens give their dry waste to DWCCs. We are sending a separate vehicle for collecting cloth waste regularly. Using the DWCCs already established collection and handling system, we are able to find markets where these clothes will find a new home, and provide employment to a new group who are working in collection, segregation, repair and management of these textiles,’’ he said.The project at Hasiru Dala has been conceived in partnership with CAIF (Circular Apparel Innov­ation Factory).The volunteers of Hasiru Dala are also happy with the response from the residents. “I have distributed pamphlets and made announcements through the public address system about the days our vehicle visits their respective areas to collect old clothes. We have collected 500 kg of old clothes till now,’’ said A Krishna, a volunteer.of Hasiru Dala said the collection drive was launched at Domlur and JP Nagar wards on a pilot basis for six months.“We will think about extending it to other areas based on the success of this initiative at Domlur and JP Nagar,’’ said Shekar.",,[],['Y Maheswara Reddy']
UNStudio uses a historic textile archive to create an immersive spatial installation,"Within the Isola Design District, themed around 'Together as One' at the ongoing Milan Design Week, the idea behind most of the showcases is to explore the potential of 'waste' in creating sustainable futures. Some of the robust contemporary solutions that we saw around product design and biomateriality are born out of things the world deems discarded; new stories that rethink conventions are seen in exhibitions such as No Space For Waste, and Materialized. One more such presentation is Dutch architectural firm UNStudio’s Future Perfect, an exhibition which delves into an extensive textile design archive to create a collection of '(extra)ordinary objects'.

A visualised closer look at the details of the exhibit, Future Perfect Image: © UNStudio

UNStudio was invited by Fashion Research Italy Foundation (F.FRI) and YACademy to explore potential design opportunities created by combining patterns from the archive with outdated products left over from manufacturing of Object Carpet and Kvadrat, two collaborators of the project, in addition to Cesare Roversi and DeltaLight. Future Perfect is a three-phased investigation that started with a six week design studio with designers to develop one product, and a spatial collection. The designs culminated into a physical presentation of the collections, on view at the Salone del Mobile, where visitors can get a ""glimpse of how fashion patterns can be transformed into an immersive spatial design and how outdated carpet and textiles can take on completely new forms and functions"". The third phase will include the product development of the collections as well as the scaling up of the concept into a meticulous detailed methodology.

In a conversation with UNstudio’s Senior Architect, Melinda Matuz, and Interior Architect Caterina Micucci, STIR discovers more about the process behind curating Future Perfect.

Zohra Khan: Could you describe what was presented to you as the design archive of F.FRI?

Melinda Matuz and Caterina Micucci: Fashion Research Italy Foundation and YACademy invited UNStudio to lead a design studio working with young designers coming from interior, architecture, fashion, and textile design backgrounds to explore the design potential of the F.FRI’s historic fashion archive and collection at the famous Silkin Factory in Milan. UNStudio had the freedom to draw inspiration from more-than-30,000-piece collection and has developed the Future Perfect concept to unlock its potential and highlight the value of the collection by taking an unconventional approach to bring fashion heritage, design and sustainability together.

We visited the archive numerous times, analysed the collection and spoke with F.FRI about the material, what drives the collection and its core values. The prints, textile prototypes, experiments and heritage albums stored in the collection all bring different values when taken as design inspiration. Understanding the development of these highly experiential prototypes was one of the main drivers for our concept.

Zohra: What were some of the leftover products that were extracted from the manufacturing processes?

Melinda and Caterina:Working with outdated products is an essential part of the Future Perfect concept. The chance to give new purpose to the leftover, out of production collections of different products, together with the inspiration from F.FRI’s historic fashion archive gives a completely new meaning to design. We aim to keep the properties of the original products and intertwine them with interpretations of these fashion patterns. The range of products to be used in the concept is not limited to textiles; we imagine Future Perfect being implemented in anything from textile to furniture, visual merchandising, ceramics, interior, and lighting design. The Future Perfect Design Studio and exhibition at the Milan Design Week, however, is concentrated on working with carpets and textiles based on our collaboration with Object Carpet and Kvadrat. Out-of-production collections of textiles and carpets were used to design a spatial installation as a visual interpretation of the concept. At the same time, the teams of designer developed two collections: one on the product scale, another on the spatial scale using Kvadrat textiles and Object Carpet carpets.

Zohra: Could you talk about the aesthetics of the historic prints which you worked with?

Melinda and Caterina: For both the design studio and the exhibition, we landed on working with textile patterns designed in the 1930s, which are part of the historic album collection of the archive. The geometric patterns, in some case combined with floral, natural forms, captured our attention in terms of their layers, scales and hidden dimensionality. When analysing the patterns, we aimed to enhance their spatial properties through our design; the patterns then move from decorative ornament to become the driver of the design.

Zohra: What have you anticipated people's response to the collection would be?

Melinda and Caterina: We would like to surprise people with our installation and invite them through a journey where they can understand the value of designing with leftovers while additionally bringing fashion heritage into spatial design. The immersive spatial experience is meant to trigger an emotional reaction and hopefully bring more consciousness about the real meaning of working with heritage patterns and sustainability. The beauty of the installation is in its simplicity which combines the original values of our inspiration and mediums, and creates a completely new meaning.

"Arklow donates 100 bags of clothing and textiles at first collection day for Donate, Don’t Waste initiative","Students from St. Mary's College, Arklow at the launch of Donate, Don't Waste at St.Mary's College, Arklow.

Students from St. Mary’s College were joined by Community Resources Network Ireland (CRNI) on Wednesday to welcome the first clothes and textile donations of the new Donate, Don’t Waste initiative.

Some 100 bags were collected and weighed for the East Region of Saint Vincent De Paul charity shops.

Christine Costelloe, CRNI’s Circular Textiles Research Lead, said: “We are so grateful for the participation of St. Mary’s College and the Arklow community in the pilot project.

“Through this collection, the students and community members contributed to important research that will inform national policy on the separate collection of textiles.”

The campaign was set up to understand the behaviours towards clothing and textiles through a survey, to share information on where and what to donate, and to make donations easier through community collections.

The donation point in St Mary’s is one of two collection points set up in Arklow by the Donate, Don’t Waste Campaign. The next community collection is taking place on Wednesday, June 1 from 10a.m.–3p.m. at the Arklow Recycling Centre.

This collection is being hosted by Wicklow County Council and the project’s technical partner, Clean Technology Centre at MTU. The bags will be again be collected and weighed for Vincent’s de Paul charity shops in the east region.

H&M Foundation project helps build traceable plastic waste supply chain in India,"Together with an ecosystem of partners, the non-profit H&M Foundation launched the Saamuhika Shakti initiative in 2020 to address the gaps in the system that keep Bengaluru waste pickers in poverty and exclusion. Now, plastic waste collected by informal waste pickers is becoming a valued resource in the fashion and textile industry, providing a higher income and recognition as an integral part of the circular value chain, the organisation says.

It adds buttons partly made from the plastic waste are now featured on garments sold worldwide. The buttons are traceable down to the source of the waste along with names of the workers, social security, salaries and working conditions at the aggregation centre.

“Waste management and material recycling are fundamental components of a circular economy, but in order for it to be truly sustainable, it needs to include the very group of people that upholds this value chain in India – the informal waste picker community. If challenges related to waste pickers’ lives and the waste sector can be addressed, waste pickers have the potential to be a key player in a global circular system – and could not only contribute to the health and state of our planet, but also uplift themselves out of poverty. We call it inclusive circularity,”says Maria Bystedt, strategy lead H&M Foundation.

Saamuhika Shakti aims to equip waste pickers to lift themselves out of poverty through a holistic ecosystem of organisations. Eight local partners are working together to support the waste picker community in various aspects – that the plastic waste pickers themselves have identified – such as safe working conditions, access to social services and good quality education, water and sanitation, up-skilling or access to alternative jobs, innovations in waste management streams that are inclusive and provide livelihoods to the waste pickers, a shift in the way the population think about waste pickers, as well as increasing economic opportunities, H&M Foundation explains.

Related

The four-year programme (2020-2023) is funded by H&M Foundation with more than $11m and is said to have impacted around 20,000 plastic waste pickers, including their families.

With the fashion and textile industry working to shift business models from linear to circular, sustainable materials are in demand, and recycled plastic plays a vital part in creating a regenerative industry. H&M Group has now become a business partner with the social enterprise Hasiru Dala Innovations, placing orders for millions of buttons partly made from recycled PET bottles (rPET) sourced by waste pickers in Bengaluru. This has extended the social impact of Saamuhika Shakti and will further benefit the waste picker community by creating jobs and income opportunities. It is a stand-alone business partnership which is not subsidised by the funds from the non-profit H&M Foundation.

The buttons are partly made from post-consumer PET waste collected primarily by informal waste pickers in Bengaluru, who segregate the waste and sell the PET to Hasiru Dala Innovations which has received “Guaranteed Member Status” from World Fair Trade Organization. The PET waste is then flaked and washed and provided to two of H&M Group’s button suppliers in India. The buttons are traceable down to the source of the waste along with names of the workers, social security, salaries and working conditions at the aggregation centre.

Shekar Prabhakar, co-founder and CEO of Hasiru Dala Innovations, adds: “Saamuhika Shakti were looking at how an economic intervention could also be brought into the programme and that is how they reached out to Hasiru Dala Innovations and facilitated the business relationship with H&M India.



“We are a for-purpose social enterprise that focuses on creating better livelihoods and entrepreneurship opportunities for waste pickers and informal waste workers. We provide this fair trade guaranteed plastic waste supply chain to the make these buttons – which creates opportunities for waste pickers to access the end-user market that would have been difficult to do by themselves. It’s not just about recycling – it’s about how we can create social impact through the process of using recycled waste. I think what is innovative is that this is a collaborative effort where multiple actors are focusing on the same community.”

Novozymes extends the lifetime of textiles with sustainable innovation,"Consumer and regulatory demands for more sustainable clothing and textiles are growing and the fashion industry is rising to the challenge. Now Novozymes offers biopolishing for manmade cellulosic fibers (MMCF) including viscose, modal and lyocell. This helps enhance the quality of fabrics, making them look new for longer and extending their lifespan.

COPENHAGEN, DENMARK – June 7, 2022 – MMCF is the third most used textile fiber in the world after polyester and cotton. Yet it lags behind polyester and cotton with a market share of around 6 percent , mainly caused by quality issues such as the fabrics developing fuzz and pills after only a few washes. This makes the garments look worn and impact consumers’ perception of quality and sustainability.

With Fiberlife® Novozymes offers a world-first family of biopolishing that minimizes fuzz and pilling in viscose, modal and lyocell. Biopolishing uses enzymes to remove loose fiber ends, leaving a clean, new-looking surface, which lasts for at least 60 washes. It can also improve print quality in daily wash and wear.

“$1With Fiberlife®, MMCF fabrics are given the wash and wear durability that consumers demand, prolonging the time the garments look and feel new. This is a better solution for the fashion and broader textile industry, consumers, and the planet,” says Dina Lipp, Global Marketing Manager at Novozymes.

Biopolishing for increased circularity

Circular fashion starts with sustainable production, free from waste, water pollution, emissions, and chemicals. Novozymes’ biodegradable enzymes support this by reducing the use of water and chemicals in the production.

“At Novozymes, we want to create forward-thinking solutions for the textile and fashion industry. That is why we have been working intensively on making MMCF biopolishing possible for viscose, modal and lyocell. We see a big potential for textile manufacturers to extend the longevity of MMCF fabrics, ultimately offering consumers longer lasting garments made of fibers from nature,” says Pedro E. G. Loureiro, Global Business Development Manager at Novozymes.

Buying clothes that last longer is central to minimizing the environmental impact of the fashion industry. Fiberlife® can help textile producers improve on quality and sustainability while strengthening the connection towards a growing number of eco-conscious consumers.

The global nonprofit Textile Exchange is the driving force behind climate action on textile fiber and materials in the textile industry. Its new Climate+ Strategy aims to guide the fashion and textile industry towards CO 2 reductions of 45% by 2030 while reducing water consumption.



MMCF fibers are sourced and produced mainly from renewable wood and can support the shift from oil-derived synthetic fibers. By extending the quality and lifespan of MMFC textiles, Fiberlife® can help the fashion industry to further reduce its environmental footprint.

How biopolishing works:

Biopolishing is an environmentally friendly process that uses enzymes to extend the lifetime of cotton, viscose, modal and lyocell.

Biopolishing uses enzymes to remove excess fibers from the fabric, leaving a clean surface.

This improves dyeability and creates longer lasting textiles.

This improves dyeability and creates longer lasting textiles. The microfibrils that protrude from cellulose-based fibers are microscopic hairs from the fibers of these fabrics. They lead to fuzz and pilling, which makes the fabric surface feel rough and trap dirt to reduce cleanness. Both the trapped dirt and the microfibrils themselves make colors and whites look less bright.

Textile mills polish cellulose-based fabrics before, during or after dyeing.

Edwin Keh on the Future of Sustainable Fashion Research and Solutions,"On May 19, Earth.Org had an online conversation with Edwin Keh, the CEO of The Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA), an organisation dedicated to the research, development and technology transfer in the fashion and textile industries, including sustainable fashion research and solutions. He has extensive experience working with supply chain operations as well as holding multiple IPs which won several international invention awards. Some ongoing projects HKRITA is currently involved with include a partnership with the H&M Foundation that sees old garments turned into brand new clothing.

—

In the fireside chat, we talked about several topics, including:

The current unsustainable business model and supply chains in the global textile and fashion industries, and the subsequent environmental and social implications.

The biggest drivers of the growing fast fashion culture and mass production, such as financial incentives and shifting labour intensive processes to developing countries (often in the East).

The areas in which we can target to alleviate the ongoing fashion crisis, whether the responsibility lies with producers and manufacturers or with consumers.

The scale and capabilities of textile recycling today, and other potential solutions or opportunities to reduce apparel and textile waste in the first place.

Current projects and collaboration happening at HKRITA, including the award-winning Garment to Garment recycling system (a small-scale, demonstrative model that turns post-consumer garments into new ones adopting a mechanical treatment that does not require any water or chemical), the Green Machine that recycles blend textiles into new clean and wearable fibres, and the Open Lab – where researchers and industry partners can share ideas and technologies, and experiment in real time.

How to direct sustainable fashion research and development ideas into the marketplace.

Edwin believes that tackling the fast fashion crisis is not a technological challenge, but one that is systematic that starts with the business model. There needs to be a fundamental and behaviour changes to reduce mass production and consumer demand. Today, people treat clothes as a “disposable commodity”. We should bring back the culture of treating clothing as long-term and functional investment, almost like heirlooms. He is also inherently optimistic about the future of the fashion and apparel industry, and that humanity will not be extinct because of our fashion choices. But, greater investment and changes are needed, and quickly, to rapidly reduce the damages and impacts to the environment.

Hyosung to Present Its Ocean Protection Initiative at Outdoor Retailer,"SUSTAINABILITY Hyosung to Present Its Ocean Protection Initiative at Outdoor Retailer

Hyosung will present its Ocean Protection Initiative at the summer edition of the Outdoor Retailer trade show in DenverJune 9–11.

The South Korea–based fiber manufacturer that provides innovations and solutions to the textile industry aims to turn ocean trash into treasure with this initiative, which begins with the development of Hyosung’s MIPAN regen ocean nylon and regen ocean polyester, both made with ocean waste.

MIPAN regen ocean is Global Recycled Standard certified, made from 100 percent recycled nylon made from discarded fishing nets and other reclaimed nylon waste. Hyosung’s process to produce the yarn includes collection, chemical recycling and creation. Hyosung awaits its Ocean Bound Plastic certification in the near future. The OBP certification was created to transparently certify that plastic waste was properly collected and managed.

Hyosung will also present a broad assortment of fabrics and concept garments at the Outdoor Retailer Summer Market that were developed by Hyosung’s Fashion Design Center to help developers and designers conceive garments made with innovative fibers, including creora regen, a GRS-certified 100 percent recycled spandex; creora bio-based spandex made with 30 percent dent corn; MIPAN regen robic, 100 percent recycled high-tenacity nylon; and regen xanadu, a mechanical-stretch fiber made from a blend of PET and corn-based materials.

“Cleaning up our oceans is of critical importance to Hyosung and many of our brand partners,” said Hyosung Global Marketing Director—Textiles Mike Simko. “Our ocean-based recycled-fiber offering will allow brands to develop eco-friendly products that align with their sustainability needs and also help provide them with a meaningful story their consumers can connect with.”

Getting ESG right for the textile industry,"Environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments are top priority for all business stakeholders. Companies have been presented with clear and rising expectations from these stakeholders – from investors to customers – to be proactive while managing ESG risks and opportunities as part of their overall business strategy. In fact, this interest has reached a tipping point with the stakeholders demanding that business leaders improve sustainability practices that benefit not only the bottomline but also generate a wider societal impact.

These demands are supported by studies that suggest stakeholders view ESG achievements as a critical part of corporate performance. Businesses with better ESG delivery are also likely to have performed better on traditional parameters. This is why ESG efforts are being ramped up, with sustainability working into all stages of the supply chain, from eco-friendly raw materials and waste recycling to educating suppliers. This is a reality across all sectors, and the textile industry is no exception.

The textile industry has long been known as a major polluter, which is what has sparked the urgency to become sustainable, improve worker safety and ensure the right of consumers to make informed choices. The textile supply chain spans across sourcing, manufacturing, processing, fabric care & packaging that produce dangerous effluents. All of this must be kept in mind while designing and implementing mitigation plans.

To that end, the launch of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme was a significant step forward. Under the policy, producers are given a significant responsibility – financial and physical, for the collection & disposal of post-consumer wastes and it has raised the ESG standards across the industries. This has taught us that ESG innovation is key to solving the world’s sustainability challenges.

A SOCIAL AGENDA

It’s not just regulatory, but also cultural factors that are motivating companies to advance an agenda that places sustainability, social good and inclusion on the same pedestal as profitability and growth. Key to this approach is the need to use corporate capabilities to solve real problems on the ground.

At the post-consumer stage, again, the EPR plays a significant role. It’s a commitment made by the producer to facilitate a reverse collection mechanism and recycling of end-of-life, post-consumer waste. The environment benefits through the recovery of resources embedded in the waste with them circling back into the system. It also ensures against greenwashing – an unfortunately common practice through which a company projects itself as environmentally conscious purely for marketing purposes but without making any real impact through its sustainability efforts.

THE CARBON EMERGENCY

The textile industry has taken the lead in delivering real impact, focusing on reducing or balancing its carbon footprint. A critical part of the ESG initiatives is responsible sourcing and farming. This spans regenerative organic farming to eco-friendly textiles creation and packaging.

Textile industries should emulate the manufacturing process that follows the harvest including recycled water, sustainable energy and efficient operations to produce eco-friendly textiles, and lastly the packaging including recycled plastic. The efforts stretch well beyond sustainable production and recycling of materials. There is also a marked shift from traditional power sources to renewable energy.

Every industry must have a long-term ESG vision. In fact, the very future of the textile industry depends on how it will use resources, recycle products, minimise waste and deliver community impact. How the industry responds to this imperative will determine its shape and nature in the years to come.

From recycled clothing destined for landfill to the latest 'streetwear',"A section of The Terrace has been repaved with tarmac strengthened by fibres from recycled clothing. Pictured: Councillor Laurie Foon, third from left, with teams from Usedfully, Fulton Hogan, WSP NZ and Scion.

A road in central Wellington has been paved with asphalt made with recycled clothing textiles – a New Zealand first and a step towards a circular economy for the city.

It’s part of a Wellington City Council-led trial, in partnership with Usedfully, Scion and Fulton Hogan, reusing the untapped resource of unwanted clothing and textiles.

A section of The Terrace, between Ghuznee and Buller streets, is the first piece of road to be laid with Strength-Tex, which uses 500 kilograms of used textiles, conserves about 11,700kgs of carbon equivalent emissions,and 568,500 litres of water.

Textile waste is one of the country's fastest growing waste streams – an estimated 220,000 tonnes of potential fibre in the form of textiles going to landfill every year. In Wellington, it made up 5.3% of waste sent to the Southern Landfill during its last audit in 2018.

A circular economy lengthens the timeframe of products by reusing or repurposing them. Cellulose recycled from textiles is currently imported for use as an additive in road asphalt to strengthen it. Instead of importing it, this project is an opportunity to redirect textile waste from landfill.

ROSA WOODS/Stuff Cellulose recycled from textiles is used as an additive in road asphalt to strengthen it.

Usedfully chief executive Peter Thompson said in a statement Strength-Tex was the first of a number of industrial scale solutions developed from unwanted textiles.

Councillor Laurie Foon said it was part of the transition to a low-carbon, circular economy – and other projects were in the pipeline.

The council’s economic wellbeing strategy is “regenerative by design”, getting the city closer to zero carbon and zero waste by diverting waste from landfill, and lowering the city's emissions.

Usedfully is on a mission to create a viable textile recycling solution in New Zealand to help divert 220,000 tonnes of textiles from landfill each year.

Other projects included the salvaging of lights, carpet tiles and doors from the old Central Library, intended for use in the new one or to be given to community groups.

Demolished concrete – such as that from the earthquake-prone flats on Nairn St, empty since April 2017 when City Housing tenants moved out – is taken to CentrePort to be crushed and made into gravel to be used at the port, and for footpaths around the city.

In Newtown, kit-set bus stops made in Spain from recycled plastic are being built. “The great thing about them is that you can set them up, take them down, and set them up somewhere else,” Foon said.

WCC/Supplied In Newtown, kit-set bus stops made in Spain from recycled plastic are being built.

The modular platforms are part of the bus and bike improvements between Newtown and the waterfront. The footpath-height, accessible platforms will allow people to get on and off buses safely and cross new bike lanes to the footpath, reconfigured to make different sized platforms, and eventually be recycled.

Five new bus platforms are being assembled along Riddiford St and Adelaide Rd between Mein and Hall streets and the Basin Reserve this month.",,[],['Kate Green']

PATAGONIA & HEIQ LAUNCH JOINTLY DEVELOPED NEXT GENERATION MINT-BASED TEXTILE ODOR CONTROL TECHNOLOGY,"ZÜRICH, June 15, 2022 /CNW/ -- HeiQ and Patagonia take their long-standing research collaboration to the next level and announce the launch of a jointly developed odor control technology for textiles, HeiQ Fresh MNT - renewably sourced mint oil-derived textile technology to control malodor development on textiles.

The long-standing research partnership between Patagonia and HeiQ resulted in yet another innovative solution for a problem on many textiles – malodor. Inspired by Patagonia's determination to continuously improve the chemistry used on all their products, the two pioneers announce the launch of HeiQ Fresh MNT, next generation sustainable odor control based on essential mint oil derived from a renewable and sustainable source.

The similar environmental and social philosophy shared between Patagonia and HeiQ was the backbone for the two brands to embark on an intense research partnership since 2015. Patagonia gives the ideas and sets the principles, HeiQ uses its expertise in specialty chemical formulation and application to textiles to create finishings that outperform the market in terms of sustainability and functionality.

Next Level Sustainable Odor Management

HeiQ Fresh MNT is the latest addition to the HeiQ Fresh family of sustainable odor management technologies, complementing the company's mineral-based HeiQ Fresh HAX and the bio-based HeiQ Fresh FFL. HeiQ Fresh MNT uses a renewable and responsibly sourced mint oil-derived textile technology to control malodor development on textiles, providing fabrics with a long-lasting odor control capability that keeps garments smelling fresh and wearers feeling clean and comfortable all day long. Based on test method ISO17299-3A using isovaleric acid, treated synthetic fibers more than double the odor control efficiency versus current industry standards.

HeiQ Co-founder and CEO, Carlo Centonze, says: ""Our partnership with Patagonia has always been productive as they constantly stretch our innovative capabilities. It therefore comes as no surprise that we were able to discover the powerful properties of mint as an active ingredient for our next generation odor control technology. HeiQ Fresh MNT is further confirmation of our dedication to enhance people's lives with sustainable innovation. With odor control you need to wash less, saving water, detergent, energy, microfiber and prolong the life of garments. We can all now look forward to a fresher smelling society with natural, reliable and durable odor control.""

Patagonia as first mover

Patagonia, as the development partner, is the first to commit to the technology and will start to upgrade its products in the near future.

Laura Hoch, Material Innovation Engineer from Patagonia, says: ""HeiQ is a valuable innovation partner and we're really excited about this technology. Not only does HeiQ Fresh MNT keep garments fresh in a sustainable way, it performs even better than what we currently use. We have been relentlessly testing this technology and lining up the supply chain to bring products enhanced with HeiQ Fresh MNT to the market as quickly as possible.""

Baldwin TexCoat G4 for Graniteville Specialty Fabrics,"Baldwin Technology has announced the installation of its state-of-the-art TexCoat G4 finishing system at Graniteville Specialty Fabrics, a recognized leader in the production of specialty coatings and coated fabrics. With Baldwin’s cost-efficient and highly sustainable spray finishing technology, Graniteville Specialty Fabrics has been able to increase production efficiency, and minimize chemical and water waste.

Based in Graniteville, South Carolina, Graniteville Specialty Fabrics produces coatings and coated fabrics that are resistant to water, fire, UV and weather for the military, marine and tent markets, and others. The company excels in developing and sourcing custom coatings, and creating specialized technical solutions to meet specific, and often unique, end-user requirements. The installation of Baldwin’s TexCoat G4 is part of a major facility upgrade to maximize production efficiency and capacity in the durable water-repellent finishing and coating line to meet growing customer demand for advanced engineered products.

With extensive sustainability benefits, unprecedented tracking and process control, and Industry 4.0 integration, the TexCoat G4 provides consistently high-quality fabric finishing, with no chemistry waste, as well as minimal water and energy consumption. The system utilizes non-contact precision-spray technology, ensuring precise finishing coverage with the exact amount of chemistry for reaching the optimal performance of the fabric. Changeovers (pad bath emptying, cleaning and refilling) are significantly reduced, resulting in substantial chemical conservation and increased productivity.

“We are pleased to be a key partner in Graniteville Specialty Fabrics’ modernization project,” said Rick Stanford, Baldwin’s Vice President of Global Business Development, Textiles. “The team reached out to us, and it was clear that the TexCoat G4 was the right tool to help them minimize waste and increase productivity.”

Doug Johnson, Graniteville Specialty Fabrics’ Executive Vice President of Development and Technical Services, said the company needed to increase its productivity and sustainability, without sacrificing fabric quality and performance.

“Anytime you change from a traditional process like padding, it is human nature to be a little sceptical,” said Johnson. “Baldwin organized production-scale trials for us at a nearby TexCoat-equipped factory. We took the finished fabric and scrutinized the look and feel and performed a battery of tests in our lab to American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists spray-rating and hydrostatic-head standards. The results were impressive. Moreover, when we commissioned our TexCoat, we duplicated and exceeded the fabric performance realized during the trials.”

"Inspired by spiders, one Japanese startup is inventing a new generation of textiles","(CNN) Five times stronger than steel , spider silk's unique qualities were recognized by the Ancient Greeks — and more recently, scientists have looked at applications from medicine to engineering.

Now,one Japanese startup, Spiber , is exploring how spider webs could transform the textile industry. The biotech company started by making a spider silk replica in the lab and has since spun out its fabric range to include more sustainable alternatives to wool, cashmere and denim, says Kenji Higashi, head of business development at Spiber.

The company's trademarked fiber, Brewed Protein, has been used in limited edition collections with brands including Japanese streetwear label Sacai and outdoor apparel specialists The North Face Japan.

Currently scaling up production and getting ready for a full commercial launch of its textiles, Spiber hopes its technology will help to ""solve some of the big global challenges that we're facing,"" says Higashi.

Fermenting fabrics

Spiders create webs by spinning liquid protein into silk. Although silkworms have been bred to produce silk for thousands of years, spiders are cannibals which makes them impossible to farm.

That's why friends Kazuhide Sekiyama and Junichi Sugahara, Spiber's founders, decided to create a synthetic material that is molecularly identical to spider silk. The duo began experimenting as students at Keio University in Yamagata Prefecture in 2004, and founded the company in 2007.

Spiber studied ""thousands of different spider species,"" as well as other silk-producing species, and compiled a database of silk varieties, says Higashi.

The Brewed Protein polymer powder is fermented with water, sugar, and specially-designed microbes. After being refined, this powder can be processed into a variety of fabrics, such as leather, silk, or spun yarn.

Having successfully produced the spider silk alternative, the team went on to develop a range of Brewed Protein fabrics by altering the protein sequence, says Higashi.

Spiber's fibers are made by fermenting water, sugar and nutrients with specially modified microbes in steel tanks, similar to those used in beer making, to produce protein polymers. The polymers are fed through a nozzle and spun into a fiber, says Higashi.

It hasn't been an easy journey, though. In 2015, Spiber partnered with The North Face Japan to produce a limited-edition run of 50 ""Moon Parka"" jackets to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the moon landings.

But during the design process, the team discovered that spider silk shrinks when wet, and had to modify the protein to make the fiber suitable for an outdoor jacket.

It took four years ""to produce a garment that met their standards,"" says Higashi. The parkas retailed for ¥150,000 (worth around $1,400 in 2019) and the small collection sold out.

A recycling revolution

Spiber uses robotics in its factory to help with the production of its spider silk-inspired fiber.

Higashi says Spiber's biodegradable textiles are predicted to generate just one-fifth of the carbon emissions of animal-based fibers once they are in full-scale production, according to a life cycle analysis conducted by the company.

Spiber wants to reduce its environmental impact further, though. The company currently uses sugarcane and corn for its fermentation process — crops that use large volumes of land and divert food resources, says Higashi.

To resolve this, Spiber is developing a process called ""biosphere circulation"" that will convert discarded garments made from natural materials like cotton into the sugars needed for fermentation.

Around 40 million metric tons of textile waste is produced every year and most of this goes to landfills or incinerators: keeping these textiles in the loop could create a more sustainable alternative, says Higashi.

Global expansion

Spiber isn't the only company taking inspiration from arachnids. In 2016, Adidas incorporated AMSilk's Biosteel fiber in a sneaker and in 2017, California textile innovator Bolt Threads unveiled its spider-silk-inspired thread, Microsilk, in a gold dress designed by Stella McCartney.

In addition to its collaborations with The North Face Japan, Spiber's Brewed Protein has been used by Japanese designer Yuima Nakazato for several of his collections, and streetwear brand Sacai for a limited-edition T-shirt range. Higashi says Spiber is exploring opportunities in the automotive industry, too.

In 2021, fashion designer Yuima Nakazato showcased a collection at Paris Fashion Week Haute Couture that featured a blue, shiny textile made from Brewed Protein fibers and silk.

According to the company, Spiber has raised around ¥100 billion ($783 million) from investors including finance firms Carlyle and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, along with grants from government organizations and startup development funds.

This funding will allow the company to expand beyond its pilot plant in Yamagata — opening a small plant in Thailand later this year, and a larger facility in the US next year in a partnership with food processing multinational Archer Daniels Midland Company. Higashi says this will enable production of thousands of tons of Brewed Protein over the next few years.

Higashi says scaling will help bring the price of Brewed Protein down and allow Spiber to expand beyond the high-end designer market.

""We have the means to create solutions to enable more circular fashion,"" says Higashi. ""It's our mission to bring those solutions to the world.""",,[],"['Rebecca Cairns', 'Cnn Business']"
The carbon cure: how to cut our waste emissions,"Emissions from waste treatment have fallen dramatically, but official figures hide the true impact of our rubbish and the considerable savings to be made from reducing, reusing and recycling more of it.

Greenhouse gas emissions from waste management plummeted 73 per cent between 1990 and 2020, according to the UK government’s latest data. The waste management sector is now responsible for around 4 per cent of the country’s emissions (17.6MtCO2e of 404.5MtCO2e) compared to 8.5 per cent in 2000.

The progress is impressive, with landfill tax driving waste out of holes in the ground – a treatment that sits at the bottom of the ‘waste hierarchy’ and produces the potent global warming gas methane. But where has all this waste gone, with its accompanying emissions?

There have been improvements in the standards of landfilling, changes to the types of waste going to landfill (such as reducing the amount of biodegradable waste), and an increase in the amount of landfill gas being used for energy. More rubbish is now recycled, and food waste has been reduced, with more of what is left ending up at anaerobic digestion plants to create energy.

Yet a lot of residual waste historically landfilled now ends up in energy-from-waste (EfW) facilities. According to government figures, these accounted for just 0.3 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), which is 1.7 per cent of waste treatment emissions in 2020. Meanwhile, landfill accounted for 17.6MtCO2e. That is not the full picture –it is only a tiny part of it, as 95 per cent of the emissions from EfW are not included in waste sector emissions, they are listed within ‘energy’ instead. That 0.3MtCO2e is only from incinerators that do not create energy.

It is a quirk of the accounting system used by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and followed by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). This skews what is going on, as emissions are reported under the waste category, rather than the effect our managing waste has on climate change. The approach sends the wrong message to people dealing with waste, according to Dominic Hogg, founder of consultancy Equanimator, which recently published a report on the topic (‘Problems in the reporting of GHG emissions from ‘waste’’). It almost invites the waste sector to be indifferent as to where rubbish goes as long as it’s not a landfill, he explains.

So why does this matter? What is the full emissions footprint of managing our waste, and what is being is done to reduce it?

Between 1990 and 2019, emissions related to incineration ballooned from 1.66MtCO2e to 5.6MtCO2e. Most of the increase has been since 2010. Still, waste emissions, including EfW, landfill, as well as other limited sources like composting and anaerobic digestion, have fallen from 90MtCO2e in 1990 to 32MtCO2e in 2019. Good news – but not quite as good as the figures in the opening line of this article suggest.

Burning waste is, by and large, better for the environment than burying it. How much better is hotly debated. A 200kgCO2e saving per tonne of waste is often cited, but that was in a 2014 report by the Green Investment Bank using data from just three plants. Tolvik Consulting, in its annual statistical release on EfW in 2020, reckoned the figure was closer to 50kg, with EfW and landfill creating 0.27tCO2e and 0.32tCO2e per tonne of waste, respectively.

So EfW wins. Yes, but only over landfill. “Modern plants are far from the polluting monstrosities of the past,” wrote Colin Church, CEO at the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (IOM3) recently, but “burning waste also produces carbon dioxide [...] so allowing it to be freely emitted in the long term is incompatible with Scotland’s desire to reach net-zero carbon emissions”.

Church has just finished an independent review of whether Scotland’s approach to residual waste management aligns with its carbon reduction ambitions, concluding that it does not. He recommends the country gives no further planning permission to incineration infrastructure as there will be overcapacity from 2026/27. Wales introduced a moratorium on EfW builds last year.

The UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC) is now including the “increasing importance” of EfW emissions in its assessments and benchmarking of the waste sector within national carbon budgets. The committee cannot afford to “hide” EfW emissions in the energy sector, explains Professor Chris Hilson, an expert in environmental law at the University of Reading. “Otherwise their advice might be to just build more EfW to solve waste emissions. The waste sector might look rosy using that accounting, but falsely so,” he adds.

Church recommended Scotland follow suit. Defra, meanwhile, is mindful of the carbon implications of simply shifting waste out of landfill and into incinerators in the long term, but ministers are not yet worried enough, say campaigners. As Church noted at the launch of his report, EfW is less damaging in climate change terms than landfill now, but “over time that will change and that’s why it’s important now to be thinking how to [...] avoid that balance becoming unsustainably bad”.

There are three ways to do this: make the process more efficient, capture more CO2 (which the CCC has also recommended), and ensure less waste from fossil sources is burned. “Every facility can reduce its carbon impact by removing plastic before it gets burned. It is a bit of a no-brainer,” says Church.

Speak to the waste companies that run EfW plants and they say they don’t want to be burning plastic. They – and the public – could do more to separate recyclable waste out first. Twenty-five per cent of residual waste is easily recyclable, according to Defra, which is launching a raft of policies to ensure more materials are recyclable and recycled. This could have considerable carbon benefits.

Take plastic, which is being billed as ‘the new coal’ by some NGOs. Too much plastic is being produced, used once, then burned. “By 2050, the production and disposal of plastic could generate 56 gigatons of emissions, as much as 14 per cent of the Earth’s entire remaining carbon budget,” wrote the Centre for International Environmental Law in 2019. Plans to expand production could make limiting temperature rises to below 1.5°C “impossible”.

Recycling more is no silver bullet, as discussed below, but it will certainly help: for every tonne of polymer recycled in a ‘closed loop’ rather than incinerated, around 4tCO2e are saved. Yet these savings are also hidden in waste emissions accounting. “Recycling tends to show up in the waste sector only by its absence, in that it leads to lower landfill and EfW emissions,” explains Hilson.

Recycling also has a positive impact that comes from other sectors not using virgin materials. “A lot of the benefits of how you manage your waste system are around ‘avoided emissions’,” explains Lorna Pannett, associate director at consultancy Ricardo. These can’t be counted when reporting waste sector emissions (it would constitute double-counting) but they shouldn’t be forgotten – as many suggested they were at the COP26 climate talks.

Pannett has been working with the Environmental Services Association (ESA) on a net-zero plan for the waste management sector. For the first time, they have calculated the emissions impact of all services provided by the recycling and waste management sector. Their final figure was 35.8MtCO2e, or 8 per cent of all UK emissions (double Defra’s figure of 4 per cent, but in line with CCC’s). Recycling processes account for the biggest chunk of these emissions, followed by landfill, then EfW and transport.

The ESA has now produced a plan to achieve net-zero by 2040, with three decarbonisation priorities: a transition to zero-emission vehicles and fuels, removal of organics from landfill and plastics from EfW (ensuring carbon capture, use and storage), plus investment in new, efficient recycling infrastructure that will help meet the government’s 65 per cent municipal recycling target.

Ricardo also estimated the avoided emissions: all 49.9MtCO2e of them, of which 44.8MtCO2e are from recycling. This swallows the sector’s entire Scope 1 and 2 emissions (those arising from its own operations and from energy purchased). As Ricardo noted in its technical report, there is a “very compelling narrative here for the waste and recycling sector to convey” in relation to the UK’s net-zero aspirations.

David Wilson, an independent consultant and visiting professor in waste management at Imperial College, London, has been researching this topic in detail. “If we focus mitigation measures just on the waste sector doing its thing better, we’re completely missing the point of the contribution it could make,” he says. How big this carbon contribution could be is unclear. Whether it is 5 or 40 per cent, it is certainly significant.

New recycling technologies may also play their part. The UK government estimates that up to 31 per cent of waste currently landfilled or burned could be recyclable in the future. For example, there is a lot of attention around ‘advanced’ or ‘chemical recycling’ to tackle hard-to-recycle plastic that traditional mechanical recycling cannot deal with. The term covers a broad church of approaches, including solvent purification, chemical depolymerisation and thermal depolymerisation, but there is limited transparency of these processes and their impacts.

Critics argue that some are incineration by another name because they are “carbon intensive and toxic”. Supporters say it’s an essential technology to help recycle more of what’s currently burned. Some technologies “have promise”, Eunomia consultants concluded in a ‘state of play’ report in 2020, but evidence available demonstrates “possibility rather than viability”.

Expect further debate too around the carbon pros and cons of chemical recycling as businesses attempt to scale their approaches. A March 2022 report by consultancy CE Delft, for the Dutch Minister of Environment, showed mechanical recycling of mono-materials and solvent-based purification/depolymerisation saved similar amounts of carbon when compared to incineration. These also had far higher plastic-to-plastic yields than pyrolysis and gasification (it shouldn’t be forgotten either that to produce one tonne of recycled plastic by mechanical recycling, you need 1.4 tonnes of plastic input). If you try to recycle mixed plastics, emissions savings start to fall, data showed.

Technology isn’t the only factor in emissions that can be avoided by recycling. Materials easily and efficiently recycled many times are far better than those that are downcycled once before dropping into the two bottom rungs of the hierarchy (think of crisp packets turned into traffic cones). Of course, the best kinds of materials are the ones you don’t need at all, notes IOM3’s Church.

The role of resource efficiency in reducing emissions and achieving net-zero is often lost in the hype around recycling. Recent global polling shows people still consider recycling the most effective action they can take to reduce emissions. It isn’t, by a long chalk (please don’t stop recycling though). Policymakers have focused almost exclusively on recycling when it comes to waste. When it comes to carbon, policies home in on operational emissions (reducing energy and vehicles emissions). This has left resource efficiency as the Cinderella of carbon reduction strategies.

Research by Green Alliance shows that improving the use of resources in the construction, vehicles, food and drink, electronics and appliances, and clothing and textiles sectors, could save nearly 200MtCO2e between 2023 and 2032. Some 79.1MtCO2e of those could come in construction through design to reduce material inputs, increased reuse of materials, and switching from high- to low-carbon materials. An 80 per cent reduction in avoidable household food waste could bring another 17.3MtCO2e, while a rise in reuse of electronics to 32 per cent offers 10.2MtCO2e.

How to achieve those is something that continues to vex ministers and officials.

Between 2013 and 2019, government actions prevented just 17,200 tonnes of waste in England per year. For context, the latest waste figure for England was 187.3 million tonnes, so actions taken had “virtually no material impact”, noted Green Alliance. The next waste prevention plan is due to be published soon, but proposals, which rely heavily on voluntary agreements, have been widely criticised.

Defra is also consulting on long-term resource efficiency and waste reduction targets, which should see focus on the top of the waste hierarchy. The plan is to cut residual waste by 50 per cent by 2042, but this excludes ‘major mineral wastes’ – inert wastes from construction, demolition, excavation, and mining activities. These are hard to tackle, but offer considerable carbon savings potential: construction, demolition and excavation created 137.8 million tonnes of waste in the UK in 2018, five times that from households.

Continued use of weight as a metric in resource policies also appears outdated in a world focused on net-zero. Consider Scotland, for example, which has been measuring lifecycle impacts of its household waste since 2011. Data from this year’s report shows where we are on waste emissions and how far we must go. Landfill emitted 244,300tCO2e and incineration 171,300tCO2e (the highest recorded), while recycling ‘offset’ waste carbon impacts by 538,100tCO2e. However, at 5.97MtCO2e, embodied carbon impacts from material production are by far the greatest contributor.

That is the “untold story” here, says Jamie Warmington, principal consultant at Anthesis. Millions of tonnes of waste is lost and reproduced every year because we are not recycling it back into the system, reusing or reducing it in the first place. This is linear winning out over circular thinking and it is about much more than diverting waste from landfill.

Herman Miller’s cheapest task chair exudes the cozy charm of a knit sweater,"Many know Herman Miller for its sleek mid-century collaborations like the Eames shell chair. Others know it for modern performance chairs like the Aeron, filled with materials and adjustments to support your body for hours at a computer.

Now, the historic American furniture brand is attempting to combine the best of both traditions. The new Zeph is an office chair that gives a nod to classic Eames lines while offering the option to slide back and recline. This approach isn’t simply a captivating design exercise; it’s also how Herman Miller has produced its cheapest task chair in history. Because the Zeph launches this August for $495. Inspired by budgets Developed in collaboration with the German design studio Studio 7.5, the chair was imagined from its earliest days to be more accessible than many of Herman Miller’s other offerings. Studio cofounder Carola Zwick is a professor at the Weißensee Academy of Art in Berlin, where students work on the sort of cheap, stiff chairs she says you may remember from elementary school. “German [educational] institutions are really poor,” says Zwick. She watched as students—too young and invincible to worry about their bodies—went heads-down on their final thesis projects, largely in front of computers. “We saw them having problems. They’d have these flow moments, when they’d completely focus on graduation work, but they’d get back pain.”

With that problem already planted in the studio’s mind, Herman Miller reached out with a convergent request: to build an entry level task chair. Many of Herman Miller’s chairs built to keep you comfortable at a desk for very long cost upwards of $1,000. (The Aeron technically starts around $1,195, though you can often find it for hundreds less.) [Photo: Herman Miller]Zwick turned to the seamless molded aesthetic of Eames-era Herman Miller products, because these molded products tend to be easier to produce. But hard-shelled chairs generally don’t move. So, Studio 7.5 began a year-long study of how they could start with a hard shell, but design it to pivot as you lean back. It’s a simple idea that was tricky to execute. Zwick pulls up a series of videos showing how they iterated on a simple mechanism to make this task possible, which functions like a spring-loaded teeter totter. As you lean back, the spring loads with your weight, so that when you’re ready to lean forward, it pushes you back with a natural assist. A secret to getting the comfort and cost quotients right was to not just place hard pivot points under the chair, but to build that entire under-seat mechanism to bend, complying to your weight. Fewer joints meant cheaper production, and a more natural feel. Once Studio 7.5 was happy with their model, they 3D printed the chair, flew to Herman Miller, and the two teams spent the next three years figuring out how to actually build it on an assembly line.

Wrapping work in color A shell chair has a clean presence for offices, but Herman Miller and Studio 7.5 had noticed—even before the pandemic—that office chairs were making their ways into more homes, and so they wanted to make the chair softer and more colorful. Their solution was a high tech yarn doily, much like your grandma may have knit. Wrapping over the seat, its expressiveness bucks the approach of Herman Miller’s typical office furniture. “To be frank, we haven’t done that since the Eames era,” says to Ben Watson, president of Herman Miller and chief product officer of MillerKnoll, The knit offers a homey feel, but the mechanized production process means there’s nearly no waste, compared to cutting and patterning fabric onto the chair. Each topper fits perfectly. Zwick notes that the team was also concerned about the impact of yarn dyeing on the environment, so they chose a process that required less water. The catch was that this method offered fewer color options than they wanted, but Studio 7.5 found a workaround. By knitting two colors side by side, they could fool your eye just like impressionist painters, blending new colors in the process.

“We [knitted] lines and looked from a distance to see how the mixture would look, and we got really good at that,” says Zwick. “And so we didn’t stop until we got a real palette without any gaps. We were able to create a box of crayons.” In person, these textiles are metameric, meaning that depending on the lighting, and your position to them, the colors will shift. This array of color will give corporate environments more expression than we’ve come to expect from a crisp office space. “That used to be a no-go in the furniture industry. You wanted fixed colors,” says Zwick. “But it’s so much more organic . . . everything gets more vibrant.”

All-in-all, the Zeph is a fascinating remix of Herman Miller’s history, and an enticing option for shared workspaces. Because you don’t need to use adjustment knobs to sit in the Zeph, it’s perfect for hot swapping desks. The caveats are that, no, it’s not designed to be as comfortable for eight-hour work as options like the Aeron (the team chuckles in acknowledgement when I suggest we should all be standing and walking around more, instead of designing chairs that promote our lethargy). And second, while you will be able to buy the chair for $495 when it launches this summer, upgrading the design to include arms and the yarn wrap pushes the price to $645.

European Commission Launches Call for Evidence on Revisions to Key EU Environmental Frameworks,"The consultations invite stakeholders’ views on the Environmental Liability Directive and the Waste Framework Directive.

In May 2022, the European Commission (Commission) issued public consultations in relation to the proposed revision of two of the EU’s key environmental frameworks. The consultations on the Environmental Liability Directive (ELD) issued on 12 May and the Waste Framework Directive (WFD) issued on 24 May mark the latest in a series of steps that the Commission is taking to revise and strengthen environmental controls in the EU, following on from the EU’s 2019 Green Deal.

ELD

The ELD was adopted in 2004 to establish a framework of environmental liability, based on the “polluter pays” principle, to better prevent and remedy environmental damage in the EU. Under the ELD, operators have a legal responsibility to prevent and restore any environmental damage caused by their activities, with the intention that this responsibility encourages operators to develop practices that minimise the risk that their activities will cause such damage.

Under the ELD, the Commission is required to carry out an evaluation of the impact of the ELD before 30 April 2023. This requirement, combined with the European Parliament’s May 2021 adoption of a resolution calling for the EU rules on liability of companies for environmental damage to be strengthened, led to the Commission announcing the commencement of this evaluation process in November 2021. The call for evidence lasted until 27 December 2021 and elicited public responses from a number of industry groups and other stakeholders.

The Commission views this public consultation as the next step in the process, offering stakeholders from across Europe and the globe the opportunity to answer a questionnaire to provide their input on how the ELD should be updated.

The public consultation will be open until 4 August 2022, and the Commission will use its results — alongside information gathered from the call for evidence, the European Parliament’s May 2021 resolution, and data from Member States — to inform its adoption of a proposal to revise the ELD by the 30 April 2023 deadline.

WFD

The WFD, initially adopted in 2008, is intended by the EU to introduce “measures to protect the environment and human health by preventing or reducing the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste and by reducing overall impacts of resource use and improving the efficiency of such use”.

Similar to the consultation on the ELD, the consultation on the WFD follows an earlier call for evidence (in this case, issued in January 2022). Rather than a specific driver for an evaluation coming from the currently enacted legislation (as in the case of the ELD), the WFD consultation process has been initiated because of specific issues that the Commission wishes to address. In particular, the Commission is seeking to tackle the increase in waste generated over the last decade in the EU and improve recycling of waste. To further these aims, the Commission is considering introducing regulatory measures to:

Reduce waste generation. These measures could include introducing targets for waste reduction, expanding the role of extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes, improving the separate collection of waste by amending certain derogations in the WFD, and introducing minimum requirements for segregation and collection of waste to facilitate collection of used items so that they can be re-used or prepared for re-use or recycling.

Reinforce the “polluter pays” principle by expanding EPR schemes to other categories of products (including textiles) and improving enforcement of EPR requirements, in particular for products sold via e-commerce.

Set targets for waste oil collection and regeneration.

The public consultation closes on 16 August 2022, and the Commission has indicated that it intends to adopt a proposal for a directive in Q2 2023.

Latham & Watkins will continue to monitor developments in this area.",,[],[]
Your Clothes Can Have an Afterlife,"Many people donate used clothing. But clothes and other textiles that are too old or worn can still have an afterlife in other products. Credit: Supakorn Limteerayos/Shutterstock

Only about 15% of used clothes and other textiles in the United States get reused or recycled. The other 85% head straight to the landfill or incinerator. This wastes scarce resources, contributes to climate change and pollutes waterways.

In a new report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Facilitating a Circular Economy for Textiles, scientists recommend strategies to address this problem. The circular economy referenced in the title is one in which materials remain in the economy longer through repeated reuse, repair and recycling, and are finally discarded only as a last resort.

The report is based on a three-day workshop held at NIST in September 2021 that brought together manufacturers, industry associations, recyclers, waste managers, researchers, policymakers and several major fashion brands that share the goal of increasing circularity in the textiles industry.

“Textiles are one of the fastest growing categories in the waste stream,” said Kelsea Schumacher, an environmental engineer working with NIST who co-authored the report. “But there are a lot of opportunities to reduce waste in this sector that would bring big economic and environmental benefits.”

The report defines textiles to include clothing, shoes, bedding, towels, upholstery fabrics and carpeting. However, the main type of textile in the municipal waste stream, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is discarded clothing. On average, each person in the United States discarded roughly 47 kilograms (103 pounds) of textiles in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available.

Many people donate used clothing. But clothes and other textiles that are too old or worn can still have an afterlife in other products. For example, they can be cut and resold by industrial rag manufacturers. The fibers can also be separated and recycled back into new textiles or used as stuffing for upholstered furniture and car seats or home insulation material.

The authors of the report compiled data from multiple sources to create a flow diagram that shows what happens to textiles in the United States after they are donated or discarded.

One obstacle to greater reuse and recycling cited in the report is that consumers lack information about how to dispose of their used textiles. For instance, many people don’t realize that they can recycle them. Cities and towns often have textile recycling drop-off centers that can be found with a quick internet search.

For more tips on how to donate and recycle used textiles, see Kelsea Schumacher’s blog post.

But consumer knowledge can only go so far. The report recommends other improvements that businesses and governments can undertake to increase reuse and recycling of textiles. These include better sorting and grading technologies, advanced labeling and digital product identification, advanced recycling processes for certain synthetics that are not currently recyclable, standardized terminology and classifications, and better data collection.

NIST undertook this effort as part of its larger circular economy initiative, which until now has focused mainly on ways to keep plastics circulating within the economy, rather than ending up in landfills or polluting the environment.

“Circular economy is about more than just recycling,” said NIST materials scientist and report co-author Amanda Forster. “It’s about keeping products in their useful form for as long as possible, then when you can’t use them anymore, finding a way to recycle them that preserves as much of their value as possible, and only sending them to the landfill as a last resort.”",,[],[]
Epson to launch new direct-to-fabric printer,"Epson to launch new direct-to-fabric printer

By Wayne Robinson | 14 June 2022

At PacPrint, for the first time in Australia, Epson Australia will present applications and samples on its new Monna Lisa ML-8000 direct-to-fabric textile printer, which it says is the new standard in textile image quality.

Direct to fabric: New Epson Monna-Lisa ML-800 to be released at PacPrint

According to Epson the ML-8000 is a “next-generation” digital textile printer with high print quality, productivity, stable operation with minimal downtime. It says it allows easy operation for “an affordable price”, making it “the ideal printer” for companies looking to move into local, onshore digital printing and production.

Epson says digital printing has become increasingly popular with fashion and textile designers, as they strive to meet the increased demands for short runs and fast fashion while under pressure from public criticism to ease environmental burdens. The ability to deliver digital designs for digital print on demand enables businesses to offer their customers a faster turnaround, without having to rely on mass shipments of stock crossing continents, much of which result in higher waste streams due to analogue printing. As such the new Monna Lisa ML-8000 represents an opportunity for all kinds of print businesses to enter the fast growing digital textile printing sector.

The ML-8000 is the new entry model in the Monna Lisa series, it comes with eight of the latest PrecisionCore printheads. Epson says the ML-8000 “packs the power and performance of the latest world-class Epson inkjet printing and manufacturing technologies into a single package”.

Epson says the Monna Lisa series “combines performance and usability to meet the needs of the digital textile market for flexibility and sustainability”. With its eight PrecisionCore printheads, the ML-8000 reaches typical print speed of 155

square metres per hour at 600x600 dpi – 2 pass. Maximum print speed is up to 250sqm an hour at 300x600 dpi, 1 pass. Resolution is up to 1200 dpi, print width up to 180cm, with up to eight colours.

The Monna Lisa ML-8000 is produced with Epson’s print partner Robustelli, which has a history of textile design and manufacturing in Italy’s Como province.

The ML-8000’s image quality is enabled by Epson’s high quality printheads. Epson says its exclusive Microweave and lookup table technologies reduce banding and graininess, and advanced new Multi-Layer Halftone Technology, which randomises the halftone dot pattern on each layer, reducing image degradation caused by dot misalignment. Dynamic Alignment Stabiliser technology also ensures stable print quality, by controlling waveforms on each printhead chip, for higher dot placement accuracy and more uniform dot density on each pass.

The ML-8000 also features symmetrical colour alignment for “consistent colour overlap order” during bidirectional low pass printing, and Accurate Belt Position Control (ABPC) technology automatically detects the belt feeding distance to ensure precise fabric feeding. The result, says Epson, is optimal quality and speed, with “superb reproduction” of colour gradations, fine details and complex geometric patterns.

Stable operation with usability is realised with the advanced cleaning mechanisms and automated adjustment functions. A fluff blower system removes fluff from the fabric surface before it enters the printing area and an ink mist extraction system helps prevent ink mist from adhering to the nozzle surface.

Nozzle verification technology detects missing dots that indicate nozzle clogging, and adjusts ink delivery to maintain image quality and reduce printing errors. An “easy-to-replace” fabric wiper roll continuously wipes the printhead nozzles clean automatically, reducing daily manual maintenance work. Accuracy of printhead alignment technology allows the user to replace the head “quickly”.

Thanks to an automatic calibration function by an RGB camera, operators can carry out printhead replacement including adjustments in as little as 30 minutes.

Epson’s Remote Monitoring System (24/7 monitoring) enables a quick response to potential problems, reducing downtime and service calls.

Ease of use is enhanced by a 9-inch LCD touch panel that displays current printer status, operating instructions, and regular maintenance procedures, and by hot-swappable, dual 10-litre or 3-litre high-capacity ink cartridges that allow

uninterrupted production.

Epson Genesta inks are available in Acid, Reactive, Disperse, and Pigment formulations in a degassed vacuum-pack. They are Eco Passport certified to meet globally recognised standards for environmentally friendly textile printing. In addition, the Acid ink is bluesign approved and the Reactive and Pigment inks are Gots approved by Ecocert.",,[],[]
"Textile waste is a growing problem — and Canada still isn't doing enough to solve it, experts say","At Paul Long's clothing store Anián, each garment gives new life to used wool.

The fabric is recycled from discarded clothing from landfills and rag houses — warehouses full of second-hand clothing — in southeast Asia and Africa that eventually lands in Vancouver, where Long's team uses it to create new garments.

Long estimates his business kept 136 tonnes of textile waste out of landfills abroad in 2020 — around the weight of a blue whale — and he's hoping to make even larger strides in recycling in the future.

Textile waste, which comes from the manufacture of clothes and their eventual disposal into landfills, is one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world.

While there are signs that governments are taking the problem seriously by providing more sustainable disposal options, some people in the recycling and textiles industries say Canada still lacks a lot of the infrastructure to properly re-purpose clothes — and that there is still too much reliance on other countries to break down our garments for us.

Long says the model of his business is ""a step forward into understanding and reducing our textile waste,"" but much more can be done.

""One day I would love to be able to, you know, set up a rag house here in British Columbia in the Lower Mainland, be able to cut off that whole sort of circular global supply chain and go straight from our own consumption to our own uses,"" he said.

Reduce, repair, donate

Textile waste is growing in large part due to increased sales of cheaper clothes and the trend of ""fast fashion"" that's leading to more garments being thrown out. On average, people are buying three times more clothes than they did in the 1980s, according to the City of Vancouver.

Metro Vancouver residents throw out around 20,000 tonnes of textiles each year, which is equivalent to the weight of 44 T-shirts per person, according to Karen Storry, a senior engineer with the regional district.

Much of that waste can be re-purposed. For a fourth year, Metro Vancouver is rolling out its Think Thrice Campaign to encourage residents to reduce how much clothing they buy, repair what they have, and donate instead of throwing away.

Storry says people might not know they can recycle even badly damaged clothes.

Across the region there are over 40 facilities collecting clothing that is ripped, stained, or worn out, according to the Metro Vancouver Recycles database , which has a map and lists drop-off locations.

""There actually are markets for your holey socks. And there actually are a lot of markets for your ripped jeans,"" said Storry.

B.C., she says, is a hub for sorter and grader facilities that sort through worn clothing — which can come from as far away as Manitoba and California — and find a new purpose for it.

Over two million pounds of rags made from used clothing are shipped across Canada every year from Trans-Continental Textile Recycling in Surrey, B.C. (Shawn Foss/CBC News)

What ends up in the landfill?

One of six such facilities in the province is Trans-Continental Textile Recycling in Surrey, which sifts through more than 18 tonnes of clothing that comes from collection boxes or thrift stores daily, according to founder Patricia Penrose.

Garments deemed unusable — for example, clothes with mould or covered with oil or paint — are sent to the landfill. They also include shoes with holes — though a single shoe without a hole can be recycled and potentially matched with another odd shoe in different markets.

Penrose encourages British Columbians to recycle as much as possible.

""The most important thing is not to throw anything away and to send it to a facility where the most items can be made use of,"" she said.

Of the material the facility salvages, over 900 tonnes a year is turned into wiping rags and sold across Canada, Penrose says.

But most of the textiles are sold to markets abroad. They include old winter jackets, the insulation of which is cleaned and recycled in eastern Europe. The fabrics of sweaters with holes are separated and also re-purposed abroad, Penrose says.

'Shifting the problem over to other folks'

But critics say sending unwanted clothing to markets abroad isn't a satisfactory solution to textile waste.

""We're really just shifting the problem over to other folks,"" said Sara Blenkhorn, who works with the Leverage Lab to help businesses improve their social and environmental impact.

In recent years there have been concerns that Canada is dumping unwanted clothes in developing countries, leading to pollution and harming local textile industries, according to a 2021 report commissioned by Environment and Climate Change Canada.

Blenkhorn says the technology to break down and recycle used textiles in Canada ""just doesn't exist here yet,"" with no large-scale resources to de-button and de-zipper clothing and then mechanically or chemically break down the fibres and re-purpose them.

Textile industry experts say Canada heavily relies on facilities abroad to recycle textiles. In this photo, a man in Italy processes used wool into new material. (Submitted by Anián)

""That machinery is expensive. And then the processes take some time,"" she said.

Penrose says she would ""love"" to sell clothing to local facilities that could process it, but neither the infrastructure nor demand is there.

Consumer habits and business practices will also have to change to reduce textile waste.

Storry encourages residents to think more about buying second-hand clothing, while Blenkhorn suggests organizing clothing swaps or setting up ""repair cafes"" to fix damaged clothing.

Blenkhorn also says retailers could host take-back programs, where they accept used clothing and turn it into new products.

""I think all of those forces will put pressure on growing our ability here locally to have viable markets for that apparel, so we don't have to send it away,"" she said.",,[],"['Cbc Journalist', 'Baneet Braich Is A Journalist With Cbc News.

From trash to treasure,"Ongoing material research guided by Cao in collaboration with Cobb includes work funded by a trade organization grant looking at remanufacturing cotton waste. In that project, students experiment with ways to use the shoddy produced by the shredding machine, including as stuffing for toys and quilts, attaching it (with another special machine) to backing to create tufted material that can be used in making purses and new pieces of clothing, or weaving it into rugs or tapestries.

In a new grant, in collaboration with the Department of Plant and Soil Science, Cao and Cobb are exploring ways to recycle waste material into landscaping fabric or geotextiles — sheets that are often made of plastic and spread on the ground to control weeds and help soil retain moisture.

Some of the RAD Lab projects are partnerships with small companies in the Delaware and Philadelphia area that want to become more sustainable. At Lobo Mau, a Philadelphia designer of printed knitwear, textile waste from manufacturing is being shredded in Cobb’s lab at UD for the company to use in other products.

“Instead of trashing our fabric scraps, we started researching ways in which we could downcycle or reuse these leftovers,” the company said in a Facebook post announcing the partnership with Cobb’s lab, adding that it is striving to be a zero-waste manufacturer.

Lobo Mau is just one example of how Cobb thinks the research from her lab can be widely used.

“We’re lucky that we have a lot of small companies that are focused on sustainability in the region,” she said. “We’re defining a sustainability model. It’s the process of discovery in the research lab, but it’s also discovery in the community.”

In addition to the work with shoddy, students in the lab are experimenting with environmentally friendly ways of dyeing fabric and with reusing waste from food, agriculture and construction.

“We’re really trying to look at every facet of textile use — apparel and beyond apparel — from creating second-generation textiles and products to engaging the community,” Cobb said. “And we want to be hyper-local, to demonstrate that local production [using waste] can be a sustainable development strategy with economic, environmental and social benefits.”",,[],['Article Ann Manser']
"City-wide greenhouse gas emissions of communities nearby the world heritage site of Ayutthaya, Thailand","Total city-wide emissions

In 2018, the total city-wide GHG emissions of Ayutthaya Municipality were approximately 99,137.04 tCO 2 eq. Energy sector was by far the biggest contributor to the total emissions (49%; 48,216.54 tCO 2 eq), followed by the waste sector (36%; 35,659 tCO 2 eq), transportation (11%; 11,191.75 tCO 2 eq), and AFOLU (4%, 4,069.75 tCO 2 eq) (Fig. 2a). Overall, estimated GHG intensity was 1.93 tCO 2 eq per capita. Similarly, a study conducted by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization16 reported that the annual per capita GHG emissions of some cities (i.e., at the municipal level) in Thailand ranged from 1.28 to 3.74. It should be noted that municipal-level GHG emissions were slightly lower than in denser cities and metro areas. Under such situations, per capita emissions seemed to decline with decline in urban density. For instance, residents in the capital city of Thailand, Bangkok, were responsible for emitting 7.01 tCO 2 eq per capita in 201616. In developed cities like London and New York, per capita emissions were 6.18 (in 2006) and 5.8 (in 2014) tCO 2 eq, respectively17. Shan et al.18 conducted an inventory of CO 2 emissions of Chinese cities in 2010 and revealed that Hohhot and Nanping generated the highest (29.67 tCO 2 eq per capita) and lowest CO 2 emissions per capita (2.38 tCO 2 eq per capita), respectively. On the basis of scope, in this study, indirection emissions from consumption of purchased electricity (Scope 2) in the Ayutthaya Municipality represented the largest source of emissions (38%), followed by Scope 3 and Scope 1 (Fig. 2b).

Energy

Energy sector was by far the greatest contributor to the total GHG emissions (49%) in Ayutthaya Municipality. Within this, the residential sector was the primary contributor to GHG emissions (37,672.89 tCO 2 eq; 78%), followed by commercial and governmental organizations (18.49%), and public lighting (i.e., highway street lighting, 3.38%) (Table 2). Among commercial and governmental organizations, hospitals, schools, and hotels located in the municipality released large amounts of GHGs (812.60–4218.84 tCO 2 eq). Compared to other sub-districts, Pratuchai, which is the most populated subdistrict and where the WHS is located, was the largest source of GHG emissions (7797.10 tCO 2 eq). Interestingly, however, the WHS emitted only 206.38 tCO 2 eq (while temples and cultural heritage site emitted 151.63 and 54.74 tCO 2 eq, respectively), accounting for approximately 0.2% of the total city-wide emissions. The results of energy-related GHG emissions obtained using the GPC were similar to those obtained via the LCA approach. Emission results generated using the IPCC2013 GWP 100a method also revealed that the residential sector accounted for a significant share of the total energy-related CO 2 emissions (74%; 31,866.18 tCO 2 eq). Commercial and governmental organizations emitted almost a quarter (22%; 10,695.76 tCO 2 eq) of this total. Meanwhile, public lighting and the WHS were attributable for only 4% and < 1% of total emissions from energy consumption.

Table 2 GHG emissions from the energy sector, by scope and source of emissions. Full size table

Relatedly, the WHS was found to account for the lowest GHG emissions using both the GPC and LCA methods. It is possible that most of the ancient buildings at the WHS of Ayutthaya municipality are located outdoors. Many of these historic heritage sites rely mainly on natural light and ventilation for thermal and lighting comfort during the day. In terms of electricity consumption, only lamps are commonly used for lighting, especially at night. However, improving sustainability and energy efficiency in built historic heritage have become high-interest topics among scholars. For instance, European countries with colder climates are most interested in reducing energy consumption in historic buildings19. The European Directives showed the potential of the building sector in achieving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Specifically, study conducted by Serraino and Lucchi20 investigated energy retrofit intervention in a castle in Italy and reported that the following criteria must be considered in the implementation of a highly-energy efficient system in historic buildings: achieving building thermal comfort and minimizing CO 2 emissions and running costs. Some studies have focused on natural lighting design and solar radiation control in heritage buildings21,22. A study of Martínez-Molina et al.19 also observed that improving indoor climate, energy efficiency, and thermal comfort in historic buildings have become a major issue. Further, Marchi et al.11 assessed environmental policies for GHG emission reduction at UNESCO heritage sites of Italy using integrated energy-saving measures and revealed that installation of solar panels on roofs of existing buildings was the most effective environmental policy for decarbonization. GHG emissions equivalent to 17,000 tCO 2 eq per year could be avoided using this measure (57% reduction in GHG emissions in the short term; 10 years).

Transportation

In 2018, the volume of GHGs emitted by on-road transport sector of the Ayutthaya Municipality amounted to 11,191.75 tCO 2 eq (11%). The combustion of diesel fuel generated the largest share of emissions (39%) compared to gasohol 91 (37%) and gasohol 95 (24%) for road transport, respectively. It has been suggested that the main factors affecting commuting-related CO 2 emissions of individuals their and households in local context of Thailand should be more investigated. This finding is in line with Marchi et al.11 who reported that diesel is most widely used in the transport sector. By reducing transportation emissions, a study of Li et al.23 suggested that many behavioral targeting policies should be implemented in mobility management in cities to reduce private motorized transport that could contribute to a reduction in CO 2 emissions.

AFOLU

Methane emissions from AFOLU within the city boundary were estimated by employing Eqs. 3 and 6. In this research, methane emissions from rice fields were estimated based on emission factor for a particular harvested area of rice, cultivation period of rice (day), and also annual harvested area of rice. In terms of land use, only 2% of the total area of Ayutthaya Municipality (i.e., Khao Rain, Klong Suan Phlu, and Huntra sub-districts) served as agricultural area. All the rice growing areas in the municipality is under rain-fed cultivation. The period of rice cultivation in this study area was about 180 days. The results found that the AFOLU sector of Ayutthaya Municipality emitted approximately 4069.75 tCO 2 eq (accounting for 4% of city-wide emissions). This is within the range of estimated GHG emissions from rice cultivation in other municipalities of Thailand (1.13–6106.75 tCO 2 eq)16. In terms of alternatives for mitigating emissions related to rice cultivation water management, Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) is a possible option to mitigate methane emission from irrigated rice paddies. A research conducted by Oo et al.24 confirmed that yield-scaled GHG emissions from AWD cultivation were significantly lower than from continuous flooding cultivation.

Waste

The GPC report10 highlighted that city should report GHG emissions from disposal of waste generated within the city boundary, whether treated inside or outside the boundary of city. In this study, the total solid waste sent to landfill in 2018 was 18,130 tonnes, comprising 95.4% of non-food organic waste, 3.3.4% of food waste, and 1.43% of solid waste that is paper and textiles, respectively. The default values of methane correction factor (MCF) of 1 and oxidation factor (OX) of 0.1 for managed landfill were used in estimation of methane emission. In 2018, Ayutthaya Municipality generated 18,130.19 tons of municipal solid waste, all of which was sent to a landfill located outside the city boundary. Within Scope 3 of the GPC, waste sector was the second largest source of GHG emissions, accounting for 35,658.61 tCO 2 eq (36% of the total emission). This result is consistent with other reports in literature; for example, Hoklis and Sharp25 reported that in 2009, 338.51 GgCO 2 eq of methane was emitted from municipal solid waste in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It was clearly observed in this study that waste disposal activities in tourism cities may result in direct and indirect GHG emissions. Further, previous studies reported that in 2018, tourist areas of Thailand generated approximately 1–2.5 kg of waste per person per day26,27. Therefore, behavior of both resident and tourist plays an important role in mitigating climate change, as it determines the solid waste generation rate of the community.

GHG mitigation scenarios and AHP assessment of climate change mitigation policy

Under the BAU scenario, total GHG emissions of Ayutthaya Municipality would increase from 99,137.04 tCO 2 eq in 2018 to 161,123.67 tCO 2 eq and 113,316.63 tCO 2 eq in 2030 in case of forecasted annual economic growth rates of 4.13% and 1.12%, respectively. The residential sector was attributable for the largest proportion of GHG emissions (78%). Under BAU condition, estimated GHG emissions from the residential sector were about 37,672.89 tCO 2 eq. This is projected to increase to 43,056.66 tCO 2 eq and 61,221.79 tCO 2 eq in 2030 at annual economic growth rates of 4.13% and 1.12%, respectively. Potential GHG mitigation options were proposed based primarily on Thailand’s NDC. If all policy interventions as indicated in Thailand’s NDC Roadmap on Climate Change Mitigation (2021–2030) are “fully” implemented in the residential sector, total GHG emissions would be reduced by 9735.47% tCO 2 eq and 6846.86 tCO 2 eq in 2030 assuming 4.13% and 1.12% annual economic growth rates, respectively. These policy interventions include (i) energy-saving measures and strategies and (ii) applying renewable energy in residential buildings. As shown in Fig. 3a,b, the forecast results revealed that applying all energy-saving strategies could provide greater GHG reduction than the implementation of renewable energy policy in the local case study.

Figure 3 Estimated GHG emissions from the residential sector of Ayutthaya Municipality and mitigation scenarios based on Thailand’s NDC Roadmap assuming (a) 4.13% annual provincial economic growth rate and (b) 1.12% annual municipality economic growth rate. Full size image

According to the judgment on pairwise comparisons of AHP, Tables 3 and 4 revealed that high-efficiency cooling systems should be excluded in the AHP. Installation of LED lighting showed the highest score, followed by improving energy efficiency of air conditioners, and energy efficient appliances and cooking stoves. Establishing renewable energy technologies presented the lowest score in the AHP comparison. In the case of factors that affect climate mitigation policy decisions and implementation, feasibility of implementing mitigation measures (i.e., technical possibilities) presented the highest score (0.45), followed by policy feasibility (0.39) (i.e., policy possibility and cost effectiveness of implementing climate strategies). Surprisingly, environmental performance (i.e., benefits of policy on environment and climate change) showed the lowest score (0.16) in terms of stakeholder’s preference for tackling climate change in the case study. These results are consistent with Heinrich et al.14 who revealed that feasibility of implementation was the most important criteria for developing climate change mitigation measures in the power sector. Direct contribution to GHG mitigation as climate benefit was one of the highest AHP criteria, which is inconsistent with this research.

Table 4 Overall AHP-weighting of the feasibility of climate policy implementation (CR = 0.0904). Full size table

Overall, as clearly pointed out above, energy consumption in the residential sector was attributable for the largest share of GHG emissions in this research case study. The following recommendations were proposed:

Aligning city policies for a low-carbon society: It is strongly suggested that each city in Thailand quantify city-wide CO 2 emission inventory and their reduction targets. The country’s NDC targets must be linked to city-level policy. Moreover, policy decision makers, local authorities, and all stakeholders should urgently prioritize climate change action policy and mitigation strategies, which had the lowest AHP score, in their local area. Specific detailed information on city-level CO 2 emissions would be much more meaningful to the decision-making process of local authorities than aggregated information at the national level28. However, interestingly, a study conducted by Gouldson et al.29 revealed that the absence of multi-level governance arrangements that potentially enable the implementation of low carbon development strategies at the urban level in Asian cities will have global implications for climate change. Moreover, there are still some challenges associated with creating city-level GHG emission inventories such as the use of different methods and approaches and the difficulty of defining city boundary and cross-boundary activities. Further, activities data at the city level are limited and incomparable. It is therefore necessary that data collection for GHG inventory at the city level be as accurate as possible and all uncertainty associated with inventories be avoided.

Creating green tourism culture in the WHS

Ayutthaya, a UNESCO WHS, is one of the most famous landmarks and a major tourist attraction of Thailand. The importance of tourism development and GHG emission is now being emphasized by academic scholars. A report by the UNWTO-UNEP-WMP1 (2008) revealed that CO 2 emissions generated by tourism was attributable for approximately 3.9 to 6% of the total global emissions in 2015. Similarly, a report by Katircioglu et al.30 found that tourism directly affected both energy consumption and carbon emissions in the long-term economy of Cyprus. In China, research conducted by Meng et al.31 assessed carbon emissions of the tourism industry using the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) and the input–output model and found that the Chinese tourism industry accounted for 2.425–2.489% of the total CO 2 emissions of all industries in China from 2002 to 2010. Overall, transportation activities accounted for about two-thirds of the total direct emissions, followed by accommodation and food services, and shopping. It should be highlighted that specific information on carbon emissions induced by tourism, especially at the city level in Thailand, are missing. This study strongly suggests that further assessments of carbon emissions from tourism be performed in future research. Further, the impacts of tourism activities and GHG emissions associated with solid waste generation should be urgently explored. Moreover, human and social sustainability of all related environmental and climate change mitigation project should be systematically investigated32.",,[],"['Yensukho', 'Inter-Department In Environmental Science Graduate School', 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Bangkok', 'Sugsaisakon', 'Environment Development', 'Sustainability', 'Eds', 'Graduate School', 'Kittipongvises']"
Spider Webs Could Help Track Microplastics in the Air We Breathe,"Microplastics are found at the deepest point in the ocean. They're in the snows of Antarctica. They're on Mount Everest. So of course these tiny particles of plastic waste are also found in the sticky traps of spider webs. That sucks, but a study published online for the August 2022 issue of the journal Science of the Total Environment looked for the first time at how spider webs could be used as a tool for monitoring microplastic pollution in urban air.

Microplastics can come from many sources, including textiles, water bottles, takeout containers and food packaging.

Environmental sciences student Rebecca Süssmuth of the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg in Germany collected spider webs from bus stops around Oldenburg.

The team put the webs through lab tests to filter out small particles and analyze the composition of what was found. ""All the spider webs were contaminated with microplastics,"" said study co-author Isabel Gossmann in a statement earlier this month. For some of the webs, microplastics made up a tenth of the total weight of the spider's structures.

The researchers included particles from tires under the umbrella of microplastics. They found differing concentrations of tire debris depending on how busy the roads were by the bus stops where the webs were collected.

The results show how spider webs could give researchers a quick overview of microplastics pollution in any given area. It's also a sobering reminder that those particles floating in the air are inhaled by humans. A study earlier this year found microplastics in human blood, though the health risks are still unknown.

It's not just the visible junk like discarded bottles that's a problem. It's also the tiny things we can't see.",,[],"['Amanda Kooser', 'See Full Bio', 'Freelance Writer Amanda C.

How Five Designers Took Textile Waste and Made Magic,"A job at the New York City Department of Sanitation is an unlikely entry point to a career in fashion, but for Jessica Schreiber, that’s where the seeds of her textile non-profit were planted. While overseeing the city’s clothing and e-waste recycling programs, Schreiber saw firsthand how much fabric was being treated as trash. While some materials qualified for the initiatives, there were still items that fell through the cracks: “Several brands reached out to me and said, ‘Well, we have textile waste but it’s not clothing. It’s fabric swatches, extra zippers, sample garments, and more,’” she says.

With a little ingenuity, these bits can have a second life, Schreiber realized. In 2016, she started FabScrap , a non-profit that gathers up leftovers from the likes of Marc Jacobs, Oscar de la Renta, and Carolina Herrera. What normally qualifies as waste is instead high quality materials for fashion students and enthusiasts alike to use for their creations. With a location in the Brooklyn Army Terminal Navy Yard and a brisk online business (prices begin at $3 per yard; with a pay-what-you-wish option for certain styles as well), FabScrap has diverted more than 950,000 pounds of fabric away from landfills in five years.

One material that often winds up at Schreiber’s non-profit is denim—notorious for its huge environmental impact , from the cotton growing process to the dye and chemical runoff to the excessive water usage. Despite its ugly reputation, could something beautiful and luxurious result from these neglected denim scraps? Marie Claire challenged five sustainably-minded designers to take a 10-pound box of assorted scraps and transform them into a garment that’s stylish and good for the environment. The ultimate goal: To not only change the material into something new, but to shift consumers’ minds, as well, so that they “think of waste as a resource,” says Schreiber, “and look for the brands that are willing to take on the responsibility for their own waste as well.”

Below, what each designer created with their discarded denim.

Selina Sanders: A Flouncy Dress Made for Movement

Working in the fashion industry as a designer for the likes of Target, St. John Knits, and BCBG Max Azria for more than 15 years, Selina Sanders saw how much fabric waste was generated on a regular basis. She was pleasantly surprised to find pieces that are normally discarded in her FabScrap box: “These denim ‘legs’ are what factories use as a reference to help a designer decide on a wash,” she says of her starting material. “I imagine so many of these are produced yearly and I’m glad we could make them into something more desirable.”

Sanders, who was born and raised in the Philippines before moving to America as a teenager, started her eponymous label during the pandemic by happenstance. Inspired by a hashtag from YouTuber Beth Jones that encouraged dressing up even during lockdown, Sanders played around with fabric she had at home to make something fancy. Her first creation, a puffy sleeved blouse made from a tea towel and a quilt, was posted by Jones.

Suddenly the Altadena, California–based designer found herself with a giant fanbase eager to buy her tops. Since then, she has expanded her line to dresses, skirts, and more, but they remain in limited quantities due to her use of one-of-a-kind vintage tea towels, which serve as the base and inspiration for each piece.

Her process for this challenge began with hunting down the right towels—navy blue with a white botanical motif for the front and a calendar for the back. “[The former] complemented the denim and became the focal point of the dress,” she says. From there, she added the flourishes she’s known for, namely poofy sleeves and a full skirt, using various gradations of denim. “I loved that the different washes could be used in a way to create a piece that looked different in the front or back,” Sanders says of the process, which felt like a big puzzle. She describes the work as old-school, ripping and resewing seams for her creation. “My design mantra is ‘Maximum Style; Minimal Carbon Footprint’, and there's nothing more fun than a full skirt that bounces when you walk or dance.” Fun and upcycled? Seems like a great way to kick off 2022.

Asata Maisé: An Avant Garde Trench

For Asata Maisé, making clothes is a spiritual experience. She describes her work as deeply emotional, inviting her customers to experience her collection through curated playlists that offer insight into her state of mind as she designs and creates. Her namesake brand centers on handmade styles and slow fashion, with an emphasis on using deadstock fabric. Maisé is best known for her patchwork '90s-style handbags that became a pandemic-era success, selling out in hours. Her line also includes ready-to-wear and accessories like bucket hats.

The designer knew from an early age that she was interested in creative pursuits. In high school, Maisé took a textiles course and her teacher recognized her abilities, encouraging her to pursue bigger ambitions. Following stints at Michael Costello and Diane von Furstenberg, Maisé moved home to Delaware at the end of 2019 to create her own brand. The pandemic upended Maisé’s plans and it wasn’t until she applied for Halsey’s Black Creators Funding Initiative (and placed in the top five), that she was able to invest in growing her business.

Maisé decided to approach her box of scraps with something familiar in mind: a trench coat design she had made in the past, albeit with a twist. “I recently watched Martin Margiela: In His Own Words and I was inspired to use the fabric pieces in a way I think Martin Margiela would have,” she says. That meant creating an exaggerated version of her signature patchwork aesthetic with unfinished edges, a nod to Margiela’s preference for minimalist and deconstructed avant garde designs. “I wanted this piece to look and feel very organic,” she explains. But that doesn’t mean unapproachable. “I also wanted to highlight the fact that anyone can upcycle what already exists with some thread and a sewing machine,” she explains. “I hope this inspires anyone to get creative with their own methods of repurposing.”

Denimcratic: A Y2K Throwback Set

The early aughts are back, and Denimcratic designer Gabriella Meyer is a fan of the revival. “That time was most definitely a golden age for denim, and I wanted to use this opportunity to celebrate that moment in history,” she says of her inspiration.

Founded in 2017, Meyer’s Los Angeles–based brand doesn’t shy away from big statements. Meyer first garnered attention with her political work, laser engraving clothing with reports of sexual harassment in the workplace. Since then, she’s tackled issues like getting out the vote and climate change. Using a mix of upcycled denim, tees, and sweaters, Denimcratic features Gen Z–friendly pieces in bold colors and slinky silhouettes that bare plenty of skin.

That aesthetic holds here. Meyer took her denim scraps and created a butterfly top, thong, and miniskirt that look as though they came straight out of Britney Spears’s closet circa 2003. “This piece was created in a traditional cut and sew operation,” she says of her method. “With some of our garments we do utilize laser engraving to create our own textile patterns; it's a great way to achieve detailed graphics on the denim without using any additives like ink or bleach,” she adds. In this case, however, she kept the focus on the recognizable early-aughts silhouettes.

As flashy as these pieces may be, Meyer’s design philosophy is restrained: “Less is more! It’s our ethical responsibility to lessen waste and try to not overproduce.”

Kayla Sade has always been interested in creative ways to make her life sustainable. While attending an environmentally-focused charter high school in Wisconsin, she worked in their urban garden and began thrifting and upcycling clothing. After college, she taught herself how to sew, via internet videos and a few classes on the fundamentals. Soon, Sade was reworking thrifted pieces, photographing them, and selling them on Etsy.

Fast forward to 2020 and Sade, who now lives in San Francisco, found herself at home with downtime to revisit these teen passions. She decided to transform thrifted Nike sweats and Budweiser towels into corsets, which she sold on Depop. Within three months of her launch, she’d gained 31,000 followers on Instagram; now, devoted fans set alerts, in hopes they don’t miss her next drop.

Sade calls her project Almost on Time. “It’s a word play on being fashionably late and also a call to stop the frantic cycle that is fast fashion,” she explains. “I give new life to old garments, literally making them into [stylish pieces] at a later point in time.”

The work also served as a balm during difficult times, especially during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests. “Literally waking up everyday to learn of another Black person being killed unjustly, or [seeing] more police brutality from the past being unearthed is a very traumatic experience. I am just glad to have sewing and design as a creative outlet and escape from the real world,"" she told Fashionista in July 2020.

When presented with her box of denim, Sade knew instantly she had to make something corseted. “[Corsets are] my signature and I started making them with upcycled materials because you use many small panels, which is perfect for getting creative with scraps,” she says. Sade cut and sewed the piece using a pre-existing pattern, adding boning and laces to give it structure. “I try to showcase the beauty of found materials, regardless of the condition or type of material it is,” Sade says. “I typically don’t dye or manipulate [anything].”

Almost on Time is an ever-evolving project that Sade hopes will inspire others to upcycle items into works of art. “The beauty is in the journey of finding things others have discarded and deemed useless, deconstructing, learning along the way,” she says. Sounds like timely advice.

Rentrayage: A Modern Dress Using Classic Techniques

You may know Erin Beatty from the socially responsible luxury label Suno that she launched with Max Osterweis in 2008. After Suno shut its doors in 2016, Beatty worked as a consultant before launching Rentrayage three years later. With a mission to rethink how clothing can be made, Rentrayage features handmade pieces that use vintage and deadstock materials in modern silhouettes.

For this challenge Beatty decided to combine denim with a vintage sweatshirt and deadstock plaid fabric that she had leftover from a previous fall season. “I was inspired to make something that fit into what I was making for our upcoming season. We’re playing with fitted bodices and this shape felt appropriate,” she says of the dress she created in tandem with the brand’s tailor, Albert Torres.

As for the process, Beatty relied on classic techniques. “It’s just good, old-fashioned draping. [Torres and I] go back and forth, him speaking through draping, me through sketches.”

The ultimate creation is a unique mismatched long sleeve dress with a pleated wool skirt. It’s kind of grunge-y, kind of schoolgirl, and definitely not something you’d ever find at a fast fashion retailer. Pieces like this are precisely why Beatty started Rentrayage, “It’s amazing what levels of creativity you can achieve with this method of designing,” she says. “This method is a win-win: a one-of-a-kind piece that adds nothing new to the environment.”

How Fast Fashion is using the Global South as a dumping ground for textile waste,"What’s going on?

Fast fashion brands are promoting circularity, but reality shows that this is still a myth. Nowhere is the failure of the fast fashion linear business model more visible than in the countries where many of these cheap clothes end up once their short lives are over: on huge dump sites, burnt on open fires, along riverbeds and washed out into the sea, with severe consequences for people and the planet.

I went on a research trip to Kenya and Tanzania to witness the problem of imported textile waste in these countries. You can read the findings in the new “Poisoned Gifts” briefing released by Greenpeace Germany.

Why it matters

When people donate their used clothes to a charity, bring them to a take-back box at a brand’s store, or to a municipal recycling station, they might assume that they will be sold for a good cause at a charity thrift store, or will be recycled into new clothes.

Fast fashion is destroying the planet.



The volumes of clothes being made and consumed continue to increase.



Sharing, repairing and second-hand must become the new normal.

The reality is, that only a small amount (about 10 to 30 percent) is actually resold in the country where the clothes were collected. Some are downcycled into lower grade products like rags, and more than half of them are exported for “reuse”, mostly to East and West Africa and Eastern Europe.

A closer look

To find out more about what happens to these used and exported clothes, I went to visit two of the top 5 global net importers: Kenya and Tanzania. I learned that in these countries, imported second-hand clothes are known as “Mitumba”, a Kiswahili word meaning bale or bundle, because they are typically sold to retailers in bales. Mitumba is relevant for many people and the economy in Kenya and Tanzania.

But when I was talking to vendors at Gikomba market, in Nairobi, they told me that these days they are often disappointed when they open the bales, because nearly half of the clothes are unusable and have no market value: their quality is too poor, or they are broken or soiled and are nothing more than textile waste.

Mitumba Market Mbauda in Arusha, Tanzania. When opening a bale of second-hand clothes the tension is high: is the content good enough to be sold again or is a lot of it just textile waste? © Kevin McElvaney / Greenpeace

So it turns out that the Global North has found a backdoor to get rid of its textile waste problem through the export of used clothes to countries of the Global South, forcing them to deal with the consequences of fast fashion, even though they have no infrastructure to do so.

Walking down from the Gikomba market to the Nairobi River, I was shocked to find I was literally walking on textile waste which was piling up along the river banks, falling into the water and flowing downstream.

In the evening some people burnt shoes and textiles on open fires to try to deal with the problem, and my eyes started burning from the polluted air. This smoke adversely affects people’s health living in the area.

The ever increasing overproduction of fast fashion has led to increasing amounts of used clothing being exported from the Global North to the Global South. In 2019 Kenya imported 185,000 tonnes of second-hand clothes and with about 30 to 40 percent of Mitumba having no market value, this means that 55 500 – 74 000 tonnes was actually textile waste. Every day about 150 to 200 tonnes of textile waste – between 60 to 75 truckloads – ends up dumped, burnt, or sent to overflowing dump sites like Dandora.

What we’re saying about it

The fast fashion trend has turned clothes into throwaway items like disposable packaging. To stop the flow of textile waste being dumped on the Global South, there is no way around massively slowing down fast fashion. Global fashion brands need to completely change their linear business models and start producing fewer clothes that are designed to be better quality, longer lasting, repairable and reusable.

In addition, there needs to be a shift away from the neocolonial attitudes of Global North countries towards those in the Global South, which impose trading practices mainly beneficial for the Global North. This effectively turns Global South countries into dumping grounds for fast fashion waste, while doing little or nothing to support or develop the clean manufacturing of local textiles and garment production that is needed in these countries, using the same high standards and best practices that are required in Europe.

What needs to happen

These shocking pictures of massive amounts of textile waste polluting the environment clearly reveal that it’s not enough for global fashion brands to only focus on cleaning up their supply chains. Greenpeace is urging them to step up their efforts to stop the huge end-of-life impacts of their products.

Recently the new EU textile strategy was released, which includes some important steps, such as a plan to ban the export of textile waste and promote long lasting, durable and repairable clothing. This is a good start, but to effectively stop the ever increasing devastating effects of fast fashion on people and the environment, regulation of the fashion industry needs to be established internationally through a global treaty.

Textiles and the environment: the role of design in Europe’s circular economy,"Textiles are identified as a key value chain in the EU circular economy action plan and will be addressed in the forthcoming European Commission’s 2022 EU strategy for sustainable and circular textiles and EU sustainable products initiative. This briefing aims to improve our understanding of the environmental and climate impacts of textiles from a European perspective and to identify design principles and measures to increase circularity in textiles. It is underpinned by a report from the EEA’s European Topic Centre on Circular Economy and Resource Use available here.

1. Production, trade and consumption of textiles

Textiles is an important sector for the EU economy. In 2019, the EU textile and clothing sector had a turnover of EUR162 billion, employing over 1.5 million people in 160,000 companies. As was the case for many sectors, between 2019 and 2020, the COVID-19 health and economic crisis decreased turnover by 9% for textiles as a whole and by 17% for clothing (Euratex, 2021).

In 2020, 6.9 million tonnes of finished textile products were produced in the EU-27. EU production specialises in carpets, household textiles and other textiles (including non-woven textiles, technical and industrial textiles, ropes and fabrics). In addition to finished products, the EU produces intermediate products for textiles, such as fibres, yarns and fabrics (Köhler et al., 2021).

The textiles sector is labour intensive compared with others. Almost 13 million full-time equivalent workers were employed worldwide in the supply chain to produce the amount of clothing, textiles and footwear consumed in the EU-27 in 2020. This makes the textiles sector the third largest employer worldwide, after food and housing. Most production takes place in Asia, where low production costs come at the expense of workers’ health and safety.

Textiles are highly globalised, with Europe being a significant importer and exporter. In 2020, 8.7 million tonnes of finished textile products, with a value of EUR125 billion, were imported into the EU-27. Clothing accounts for 45% of imports in terms of volume, followed by household textiles, other textiles and footwear (Eurostat, 2021a). The EU imports mainly from China, Bangladesh and Turkey, and exports mainly to the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United States (Euratex, 2020).

Consumption

European households consume large amounts of textile products. In 2019, as in 2018, Europeans spent on average EUR600 on clothing, EUR150 on footwear and EUR70 on household textiles (Köhler et al., 2021; Eurostat, 2021b).

The response to the COVID-19 pandemic, involving stay-at-home measures and the closure of companies and shops, decreased textile production and demand overall (Euratex, 2021). As a result, the consumption of clothing and footwear per person decreased in 2020, relative to 2019, while the consumption of household textiles slightly increased. Average textile consumption per person amounted to 6.0kg of clothing, 6.1kg of household textiles and 2.7kg of shoes in 2020 (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. EU-27 estimated consumption of clothing, footwear and household textiles in 2020, per person, in kilograms

Source: EEA and European Topic Centre on Circular Economy and Resource Use.

Apart from this COVID-related drop in consumption in 2020, the estimated consumption of clothing and footwear stayed relatively constant over the last decade, with slight fluctuations between years (see Figure 2). Similarly, the consumption of household textiles was also relatively steady, with a slight increase over the decade.

Figure 2. EU-27 estimated consumption of clothing, footwear and household textiles (excluding fur and leather clothing) for the period 2010-2020 (million tonnes and kilograms per person)

Note: Calculated as production + import - export.

More info...

When calculating the ‘estimated consumption’ based on production and trade data from 2020, and excluding industrial/technical textiles and carpets, total textile consumption is 15kg per person per year, consisting of, on average:

6.0kg of clothing

6.1kg of household textiles

2.7kg footwear.

For 2020, this amounts to a total consumption of 6.6 million tonnes of textile products in Europe. Textile consumption estimates are uncertain, as they vary by study, often using different scopes and calculation methods.

2. Environmental and climate impacts of textiles

The production and consumption of textiles has significant impacts on the environment and climate change. Environmental impacts in the production phase result from the cultivation and production of natural fibres such as cotton, hemp and linen (e.g. use of land and water, fertilisers and pesticides) and from the production of synthetic fibres such as polyester and elastane (e.g. energy use, chemical feedstock) (ETC/WMGE, 2021b). Manufacturing textiles requires large amounts of energy and water and uses a variety of chemicals across various production processes. Distribution and retail are responsible for transport emissions and packaging waste.

During use and maintenance — washing, drying and ironing — electricity, water and detergents are used. Chemicals and microfibres are also emitted into the waste water. Meanwhile, textiles contribute to significant amounts of textile waste. At the end of their life, textiles often end up in general waste and are incinerated or landfilled. When textile waste is collected separately, textiles are sorted and reused, recycled or disposed of, depending on their quality and material composition. In 2017, it was estimated that less than 1% of all textiles worldwide are recycled into new products (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).

To illustrate the magnitude of the impacts of textile consumption on raw material use, water and land use and greenhouse gas emissions compared with other consumption categories, we have updated our calculations of the life cycle environmental and climate impacts in the EU. We used input-output modelling based on data from the Exiobase database and Eurostat. In line with the reduced textile consumption level in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the environmental impacts decreased from 2019 to 2020.

Raw material use

Large amounts of raw materials are used for textile production. To produce all clothing, footwear and household textiles purchased by EU households in 2020, an estimated 175 million tonnes of primary raw materials were used, amounting to 391kg per person. Roughly 40% of this is attributable to clothes, 30% to household textiles and 30% to footwear. This ranks textiles as the fifth highest consumption category in Europe in terms of primary raw material use (see Figure 3).

The raw materials used include all types of materials used in producing natural and synthetic fibres, such as fossil fuels, chemicals and fertilisers. It also includes all building materials, minerals and metals used in the construction of production facilities. Transport and retail of the textile products are included as well. Only 20% of these primary raw materials are produced or extracted in Europe, with the remainder extracted outside Europe. This shows the global nature of the textiles value chain and the high dependency of European consumption on imports. This implies that 80% of environmental impacts generated by Europe’s textile consumption takes place outside Europe. For example, cotton farming, fibre production and garment construction mostly take place in Asia (ETC/WMGE, 2019).

Water use

Producing and handling textiles requires large quantities of water. Water use distinguishes between ‘blue’ water (surface water or groundwater consumed or evaporated during irrigation, industry processes or household use) and ‘green’ water (rain water stored in the soil, typically used to grow crops) (Hoekstra et al., 2012).

To produce all clothing, footwear and household textiles purchased by EU households in 2020, about 4,000 million m³ of blue water were required, amounting to 9m³ per person, ranking textiles’ water consumption in third place, after food and recreation and culture (see Figure 4).

Additionally, about 20,000 million m³ of green water was used, mainly for producing cotton, which amounts to 44m³ per person. Blue water is used fairly equally in producing clothing (40%), footwear (30%) and household and other textiles (30%). Green water is mainly consumed in producing clothing (almost 50%) and household textiles (30%), of which cotton production consumes the most.

Figure 4. Water use in the upstream supply chains of EU-27 household consumption domains in 2020 (million m³ (blue) water)

Source: EEA and European Topic Centre on Circular Economy and Resource Use, based on Exiobase v3.8.1.

More info...

Water consumption for textiles consumed in Europe mostly takes place outside Europe. It is estimated that producing 1kg of cotton requires about 10m³ of water, typically outside Europe (Chapagain et al., 2006).

Land use

Producing textiles, in particular natural textiles, requires large amounts of land. The land used in the supply chain of textiles purchased by European households in 2020 is estimated at 180,000 km², or 400m² per person. Only 8% of the land used is in Europe. Over 90% of the land use impact occurs outside Europe, mostly related to (cotton) fibre production in China and India (ETC/WMGE, 2019). Animal-based fibres, such as wool, also have a significant land use impact (Lehmann et al., 2018). This makes textiles the sector with the third highest impact on land use, after food and housing (see Figure 5). Of this, 43% is attributable to clothes, 35% to footwear (including leather shoes, which have a high land use impact because of the need for cattle pasture) and 23% to household and other textiles.

Figure 5. Land use in the upstream supply chains of EU-27 household consumption domains in 2020 (million km²)

Greenhouse gas emissions

The production and consumption of textiles generate greenhouse gas emissions, in particular from resource extraction, production, washing and drying, and waste incineration. In 2020, producing textile products consumed in the EU generated greenhouse gas emissions of 121 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) in total, or 270kg CO 2 e per person. This makes textiles the household consumption domain responsible for the fifth largest impact on climate change, after housing, food, transport and mobility, and recreation and culture (see Figure 6). Of this, 50% is attributable to clothes, 30% to household and other textiles, and 20% to footwear. While greenhouse gas emissions have a global effect, almost 75% are released outside Europe, mainly in the important textile-producing regions in Asia (ETC/WMGE, 2019).

About 80% of the total climate change impact of textiles occurs in the production phase. A further 3% occurs in distribution and retail, 14% in the use phase (washing, drying and ironing), and 3% during end of life (collection, sorting, recycling, incineration and disposal) (ECOS, 2021; Östlund et al., 2020).

Textiles made from natural fibres, such as cotton, generally have the lowest climate impact. Those made from synthetic fibres (especially nylon and acrylic) generally have a higher climate impact because of their fossil fuel origin and the energy consumed during production (ETC/WMGE, 2021b; Beton et al., 2014).

3. Design as an enabler of circular business models for textiles

To reduce the environmental and climate change impacts of textiles, shifting towards circular business models is crucial to save on raw materials, energy, water and land use, emissions and waste (ETC/WMGE, 2019). Implementing and scaling circular business models requires technical, social and business model innovation; as well as enablers from policy, consumption and education (EEA, 2021).

Circular design is an important component of circular business models for textiles. It can ensure higher quality, longer lifetimes, better use of materials, and better options for reuse and recycling. While it is important to enable the recycling and reuse of materials, life-extending strategies, such as design for durability, ease of reuse, repair and remanufacturing, should be prioritised. Preventing the use of hazardous chemicals and limiting toxic emissions and release of microplastics at all life cycle stages should be incorporated into product design.

Designing for circularity is the most recent development in design for sustainability. Expanding a technical and product-centric focus to a focus on large-scale system-level changes (considering both production and consumption systems) shows that this latest development requires many more disciplines than traditional engineering design. Product design as a component of a circular business model depends on consumer behaviour and policy to realise its potential and enable implementation. Figure 7 shows the linkages between the circular business model, product design, consumer behaviour and policy. All are needed to slow down and close the loop, making it circular.

Below we discuss circular business model pathways that could support the shift towards a circular textiles system and how the design phase plays a critical role in each of these. The circular business model should focus on longevity and durability, optimised resource use, collection and reuse, and recycling and material use.

Longevity and durability

The first pathway to circularity is to ensure the longevity and durability of textile products through circular design. Increasing durability allows longer use and reuse of products, contributing to extending the life cycle of textiles. Fast-changing fashion trends and a decrease in product quality have reduced the life span of clothes. Over the last 20 years, the use time of clothes decreased by 36%, with each garment used an average of seven or eight times (Lujan-Ornelas et al., 2020; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). This pathway requires a shift to circular business models that support longer product use and to more sustainable purchasing behaviours and lifestyles.

At the design stage, careful selection of materials increases the longevity, durability and repairability of textiles. The materials used determine the potential to keep the product in use for longer and the ease of repair. Several underlying design principles increase the durability and quality of garments, including technical requirements for colour fastness and fabric resistance, and practical requirements that clothes are multifunctional and fit for purpose and that repair kits and/or spare parts are available.

Circular design principles are important for product longevity and durability because 40% of all reasons for consumers discarding clothes are linked to (functional) changes of garments (Laitala et al., 2015), including:

a hole or tear

worn-out appearance

loss of elasticity or shape

stains

colour changing or fading.

In addition to introducing durable and eco-friendly materials, it is important to bring about behavioural changes in consumers. Here, the focus should be on timeless design (slow fashion) to counter fast-moving fashion trends, and on providing product care information and offering repair services (e.g. in-store repair in retailers or partnerships with local repair shops). All aspects could play an important role in fostering the consumer’s emotional connection with garments and their appreciation of them.

In addition to behavioural and educational enablers, policy enablers are needed to support longevity and durability. They include eco-design requirements, harmonised extended producer responsibility schemes, economic instruments (such as taxes on certain uses of unwanted materials) and support for desirable production processes (ETC/WMGE, 2019, 2021a; EuRIC, 2020; OECD, 2017).

Optimised resource use

The second pathway is optimising resource use to reduce pressures. Companies in the textiles sector are focusing on reducing and optimising water and energy use, air emissions and water pollution by using safe chemicals and diversified biodegradable materials. In recent years, the circular economy transition has led some parts of the textile industry to the introduction of business models that promote access to products over ownership. Access-based business models have the potential to increase the use of products while reducing the use of new materials and textile waste (EEA, 2021; ETC/WMGE, 2021a).

At the production stage, eco-design principles have been identified to optimise resource use. These include reducing emissions, waste and inputs such as water, chemicals and energy, and producing fibres from renewable sources and/or recycled content. Design requirements certifying a minimum content of recycled material could also optimise resource use. Less than 1% of textile waste is recycled into new fibres for clothing. The non-reusable fraction is mostly downcycled into industrial rags, upholstery filling and insulation or is incinerated or landfilled (Pappas, 2021). Design requirements could also indirectly increase the collection of materials for reuse and recycling and potentially bring new sorting and waste recovery streams.

Some companies offer clothing subscription services, in which customers pay a fee to rent a specific number of garments. This allows them to change their wardrobe frequently, without acquiring new clothes. To fulfil the potential of these business-to-consumer models, consumers need to see them as viable alternatives to traditional purchases. However, the extent to which these models perpetuate the desire for ever-changing wardrobes, underpinning unsustainable levels of consumption and production, needs to be carefully assessed.

Several international certifications and labels have already paved the way for optimising resource use. However, to decouple profit generation from resource use, alternative ownership models, such as clothing subscription services and leasing models, need to be supported by policy. These policy enablers then need to support the successful adoption of access-based business models, define regulations on ownership, transport and trade of textiles (including waste streams) and promote regulatory incentives (such as VAT reductions or extended producer responsibility).



Collection and reuse

The third pathway in which design plays a role is the collection and reuse of textiles. Circular business models built around the collection and resale of textiles aim to extend their life beyond the first user (EEA, 2021). Currently, only about 20% of consumers regularly buy pre-owned clothes, according to a 2020 ING survey (ING, 2020). Online platforms for buying and selling clothes are increasingly popular, and some brands and retailers have introduced take-back services and pre-loved collections. The success of these alternative business models depends on factors such as brand image and the style and quality of products (Hemkhaus et al., 2019). Moreover, the product type has an impact on the potential for reuse. For example, baby’s and children’s clothes are typically used for only a short time and are often sold in second-hand shops and on online platforms. Similarly, luxury brands and designer and vintage pieces are often sold for reuse (ETC/WMGE, 2021a).

Understanding consumers’ behaviour and their attitude and motivation to the disposal of textiles is important, so that collection schemes and selling platforms are set up in ways that work. Companies need to tell customers what happens to the textiles collected. This motivates them to participate, while transparency also helps to prevent corporate greenwashing. There is a risk that increasing the collection of reused clothes encourages more consumption of new resources, as consumers free up space in their wardrobes (ETC/WMGE, 2021a; Köhler et al., 2021).

To successfully adopt circular business models that enable collection and reuse, specific regulations on the transport and trade of collected textiles are necessary. Targets and regulatory incentives for reuse activities and extended producer responsibility schemes are ways forward that support investment in collection, reuse and recycling capacities (ECOS, 2021; ETC/WMGE, 2021a).

Recycling and material reuse

While the previous pathways focused on ‘slowing down the loop’, the last pathway on recycling and material reuse ‘closes the loop’. By reducing resource use and prolonging the useful life of textiles, this model enables the loop to be closed by turning waste textiles into raw material for new textiles or other production chains. Material can be reused at the fabric level through remanufacturing, also often referred to as ‘upcycling’, or at the fibre level through recycling. Both reduce the need for virgin raw materials and textile waste generation (EEA, 2021).

Despite interest from a range of stakeholders, the recyclability of textiles is rarely considered in the design process (Watson et al., 2017). Because of specific functional needs (e.g. stretchiness), aesthetic reasons (e.g. use of prints or layers) or economic reasons (e.g. mixing natural fibres with less expensive synthetic fibres), other considerations in the design process are often given priority over design for recycling. This results in almost one third of all textile waste being unsuitable for fibre-to-fibre recycling (Köhler et al., 2021). Likewise, textile products containing (non-removable) buttons, zippers or other accessories are difficult to recycle. In order not to interfere with recycling or create additional waste streams, trims and accessories should be easily removed. Textile products should be labelled with the materials and chemicals they contain and whether they are pure or mixed, as textile recycling processes have different input requirements. This helps prevent toxic chemicals from recirculating (Bauer et al., 2018; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2021; Köhler et al., 2021).

Designing and making a product for recycling is effective only if the loop is actually closed. Although there are no figures for all EU countries, the collection rate of used textiles in the EU varies significantly from 4.5% in Latvia to 45% in the Netherlands (Köhler et al., 2021). This means that the majority of used clothing and household textiles are still disposed of in mixed municipal waste streams. Mandatory collection of textiles will be introduced in the EU in 2025.

Possible areas for enhancing the recycling rate of textiles include:

policy support in the form of tax incentives for textile products containing recycled content

tax penalties on conventional products

extended producer responsibility schemes.

These policies would contribute to internalising the environmental costs of virgin fibres and effectively give recycled fibres and material reuse an economic advantage. This would encourage manufacturers to apply design for recycling in their operations, as it would be coupled with a bonus-malus system to reflect circular characteristics such as durability, reuse, repairability and recyclability (ECOS, 2021; Köhler et al., 2021; ETC/WMGE, 2021a).

Qatar aims high with circular economy plan,"Being held less than six months before the World Cup starts in Doha, Qatar’s Minister of Municipality emphasised how the state wanted recyclable materials to be available for making into products as part of a circular economy strategy.

The Minister of Municipality, Dr. Abdullah bin Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Subaie, said that the organisation of the conference signified “the great interest that the State attributes to the reduction, elimination, proper management and recycling of waste, to be a multi-use source for a number of diverse products, industries and businesses that serve the economy and contribute to preserving the Qatari environment.”

He explained that under the supervision of the Emir of Qatar, His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, a national programme to deal with solid waste had been prepared.

Comprehensive

The Minister explained that a comprehensive strategy to deal with all types of waste produced had been drawn up with the development of an integrated national programme for solid waste underway.

This includes integrated infrastructure with a “strengthening of relationships with the private sector” as well as “raising and consolidating public awareness of the importance of waste reduction and recycling”.

And, Minister Al-Subaie also emphasised that holding the conference and an exhibition supports the idea of community participation to preserve the environment, “encouraging investment, as the conference attracts many governmental institutions, the private sector, and international and regional bodies in this vital and important field.”

Day one of the conference heard from a range of Qatari and other speakers all signifying that change was, and is, on the way.

Science

Patrick Child, deputy director general in the innovation wing of the European Commission, said that the science was clear in terms of global warming and that there had to be immediate action to make the world more sustainable.

Welcoming Qatar’s proposals, he said “there is great potential for circular economies and the application of new technology to waste streams”.

The circular economy approach, noted Mr Child, involves “a highly complex set of process chains including collection”.

A better-performing recycling sector depends on a quality supply of separately collected waste – Patrick Child, European Commission

The EU official then explained how the EU had extended the principle of producer responsibility and how a “better-performing recycling sector depends on a quality supply of separately collected waste”.

Solutions

Qatar’s work on solid waste management and the strategic goal of a circular economy are part of the country’s Vision 2030, explained Engineer Hend Hassan, from the Strategic Projects division at the Ministry of Municipality.

She said that recycling solutions are being sought and that these are being implemented with recycling industries.

Waste is categorised into either hazardous or non-hazardous and then the non-hazardous is categories into five categtories, including household and commercial/industrial. A two bin system is used and this consists of a blue bin for commingled material and a black bin for mixed waste and there are parts of the city where waste is separated at source.

Transfer stations also carry out some sorting and most of what is not recyclable goes to energy.

“A small part goes to landfill, which is in the process of closing,” said Engineer Hassan. And, by 2030 Qatar would like to have a recycling rate of 95%, she said, although conceded this is a ‘very high goal”.

Qatar currently has an ageing landfill site and is in the process of assessing tenders for the construction of a new state of the art facility.

Enthusiasm

Enthusiasm for the place of energy from waste came from Benoit Englebert, sales and business development manager at Keppel Singhers, Singapore which operates Qatar’s energy from waste plant.

Mr Englebert spoke of the advantage of energy from waste over landfill, saying that landfills can cause contamination and blown plastics, with methane “80 times more harmful than CO2”.

He declared that a circular economy was not possible for every kind of waste, such as contaminated waste and non-recyclable waste where recycling was to expensive or complex and cited shoes and tyres as examples.

“Waste to energy can help reverse climate change by capturing carbon,” said Mr Englebert.

Energy from waste was one of the areas where carbon capture and storage projects may see the issuing of carbon market instruments, the conference was told by the next speaker.

Carbon

An expert in carbon markets, Kishor Rajhansa, chief operations officer for the Global Carbon Council based in the Gulf, said that 52-58 giga tons were needed to be reduced under the Paris agreement. And, he pointed out that emitters of carbon, such as the aviation industry, were looking at carbon markets to account for saving of carbon.

Mr Rajhansa predicated that there could be 500 million credits by 2032 and that carbon credits could be used to finance recycling projects in Qatar.

Projects that could generate credits where huge in number with many outside of the waste sector but within the waste sector the could include biodiesel and biogas as well as energy from waste where carbon is captured.

Legislation

As with the UK and Europe, sustainable waste management has been driven by legislation. The importance of new regulations in waste management and recycling was emphasised by Ahmed Al-Emadi, Director of Legal Affairs at the Ministry of Municipality.

He explained how the Ministry continues to provide regulator tools to help to contribute to the 2030 National Vision. “These laws reflect the trends of the country.. efforts started in placing regulatory tools in 2019 as the first cornerstone of a just law on waste treatment.”

More regulations are now under the “final stages of revision by municipal parties here” said Mr Al-Emadi.

These measures include describing the types of waste that should be treated and recycled and the percentage targets for waste, the issuance of permits for the private waste sector and a number of other topics. The law, he said, has also put in pace “penalties and reconciliations for breaches of law”.

The first regulatory tool had come into force in October 2021 and this clarified the definition of solid waste as recyclable or non-recyclable. It obliges companies, institutions and shops to have the appropriate number of containers to store and hold recycling and waste in a proper manner and to move this waste into treatment stations and plants to recycle them.

Veolia

Thierry Dezenclos, head of Veolia in Qatar, spoke about the importance of having green landfills where the leachate is captured to produce electricity through biogas. But he also emphasised the importance of running landfills well. “A green landfill is not about design, you have to operate it correctly. If that is not the case, the life of your cells could be shortened.”

18R project

The first day of the event also saw the launch of the 18R project, which represents 18 words beginning with the letter R, all signifying actions to boost the environment and recycling.

These were explained by Engineer Jawa M Al-Sulaiti who ran through the words, such as R for raising awareness of waste management and increase the recycling of waste. Other words included reduce, restore, regulate and recruit.

Daniel Ochoa of the the Ministry of Municipality, spoke of how trials were underway into different ways to use wastes by turning them into a product. He gave examples of how wastes were being used to make composite materials such as bottom ash and rubber for making a safety deck material and bottom ash and textiles from tyres used to make thermal wall insulation.

Straw poll

Other points from the day were that in a straw poll of delegates, a number admitted to not fully sorting their waste. There were also concerns expressed that food waste should be tackled more in Qatar, particularly at large gatherings.",,[],"['Patrick Child', 'European Commission']"
Industry Gets Behind Textile Waste and Recycling Projects in India,"Two new projects supported by the apparel and home goods industry aim to help India’s textile sector deal with its pre- and post-consumer waste.

India is one of the world’s largest textile producers and importers of used clothing, but lacks an infrastructure to deal with textile waste, leaving an estimated 4 million informal waste workers trapped in low-income, unreliable jobs, according to the organizations behind the new projects.

Enviu-CAIF initiative

Enviu, Circular Apparel Innovation Factory (CAIF) and Ikea Foundation have partnered to set the ground for building a new circular textile waste model in India that will help recover and reclaim value from textiles waste, while unlocking green jobs for the waste workers who are one of the most vulnerable and underserved communities.

Enviu and CAIF will together build capacities and skills among these waste workers and build successful circular enterprises to reclaim value from textile waste.

The Ikea Foundation is funding the initial and seeding phase of the five-year project, which will be implemented as a joint initiative of Enviu and CAIF. The five-year project has taken on the mission of creating more than 5,000 green jobs, while saving at least 20 million kilos of textiles waste from ending up in landfills by 2026.

In the first phase of the program, Enviu and CAIF will be seeking partnerships with manufacturers, brands and innovators to scale and replicate solutions to manage textiles waste, as well as NGO’s and other civil society actors to build skills and capacities for the waste workers in India.

“The Ikea Foundation has always worked toward supporting people living in underserved communities to afford a better life,” Vivek Singh, head of portfolio-employment and entrepreneurship at the Foundation, said. “There is huge potential in the textile waste sector not only to become more sustainable, but also to create better livelihoods for a large number of people at the bottom of the pyramid. We believe that green and circular entrepreneurship in India’s textile waste sector offers an opportunity for vulnerable workers to lift themselves out of poverty while protecting the planet. That’s why we are happy to be part of this initiative.”

Venkat Kotamaraju, director of CAIF, said the scale and scope of the problems being addressed by the textiles and apparel industry globally demands an active investment into setting up an ecosystem and mechanisms that will make “circularity within reach” and “de-risks the participation” of the value chain stakeholders in a circular economy.

This program “lays a strong foundation for realizing our vision for zero-leakage of textiles waste into the environment and helping decarbonize the industry’s footprint,” Kotamaraju said.

Ankie Van Wersch, CEO of Enviu said the company’s “top-down impact-driven venture building approach, combined with CAIF’s bottom-up ecosystem building among waste workers is a winning combination, maximizing impact.”

Sorting For Circularity India Project

In a separate development, Fashion for Good launched the Sorting For Circularity India Project, a consortium to understand the pre-consumer and post-consumer textile waste streams in India, and to pilot sorting and mapping solutions. The project aims to build an infrastructure toward greater circularity in the years to come.

The project brings together industry players including Fashion for Good partners Adidas, Levi Strauss & Co., PVH Corp., Arvind Limited, Birla Cellulose and Welspun India. A key technology partner for the project is Fashion for Good innovator Reverse Resources, which provides the analysis of the pre-consumer textile waste streams, in addition to designing and running the pre-consumer pilot. The project is supported through catalytic funding provided by Laudes Foundation.

“India is a critical hub, not only for textile production and consumption, but also as a global post-consumer textile waste destination,” Katrin Ley, managing director at Fashion for Good, said. “This project is pivotal to understanding the size of this considerable market and providing the incentive, tools and means for the industry to benefit from the wealth of this untapped resource.”

Given India’s position as a manufacturing and consumption market of textiles, it produces large streams of pre-consumer and domestic post-consumer waste. Pre-consumer waste is only partially recycled, with the remaining portion mostly downcycled to products of inferior quality, Fashion for Good noted.

Domestic post-consumer waste on the other hand is exceptionally difficult to trace, with limited data available to understand the quantities, composition and other factors key to its recycling. India is also one of the largest recipients of global post-consumer textile waste, with millions of tons of discarded textile imported and manually sorted through various hubs.

In addition to the lack of accurate information, no technologies currently exist to organize, categorize and sort materials to ensure quality textile waste is accessible for recyclers that require sorted feedstocks in large volumes.

While these are not the only challenges faced by recyclers, they are significant barriers to the growth of chemical recycling technologies in India. The Sorting for Circularity India project aims to address these challenges and build an accessible infrastructure for manufacturers, sorters, collectors, waste handlers and recyclers in India.

Over 15 months, the project will demonstrate a new textile value chain across three phases. First, by obtaining an overall understanding of the textile waste supply chain of pre-and post-consumer textile waste in India. Second, by identifying and piloting technologies that enable the traceability of textile waste and its accessibility to existing recyclers, and finally, providing recyclers with access to textile waste feedstocks that meet the quality parameters of advanced recycling technologies, giving these technologies an incentive to scale in India.

The first phase to map the current supply chain of textile waste draws on the expertise and technology of Reverse Resources. This phase also leverages the knowledge, experience and on-the-ground support of local stakeholders. One, Sattva Consulting, is a social development consulting and research firm with experience in undertaking landscape, market and community-based studies. Another, Saahas Zero Waste, is proficient in waste management with a stronghold on the informal sector in India and is supported by suppliers selected by the project industry partners that participate in the study.

The results and learnings from this phase will be shared in an open-source report available to the public, to be released in mid-2022.

“Recycling technologies are going to be the future of the industry and to get there we need access to traceable, high-quality textile waste for all waste streams,” Abhishek Bansal, head of sustainability at Arvind, said. “We will be looking at efficiently recycling traceable textile waste and help along in building a new textile waste value chain in India. This project is a great opportunity to help organize the India textile waste market, making it traceable and accessible to recyclers, manufacturers and brands.”",,[],['Arthur Friedman']
How to Recycle Textiles and Ideas to Give New Life to Old Clothes,"The vast majority of textiles are completely recyclable. Textiles include all items made from cloth or artificial fabric, including things like clothing, bed linens, cloth napkins, towels, and more.

After used textiles are given to a recycling company, they are sorted by material and color, processed to pull or shred them into raw fibers, thoroughly cleaned, re-spun into new textiles, and reused to make rags, garments, insulation, and a variety of other products.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, about 17 million tons of textile municipal solid waste (MSW) was generated in 2018, which represents 5.8% of total MSW generation that year. The recycling rate for textiles was 14.7%, meaning 2.5 million tons of textiles were recycled. The other 14.5 million tons were either combusted or sent to landfills. For reference, the recycling rate for aluminum in 2018 was 34.9%, and the recycling rate for glass was 31.3%.

Textiles placed into landfills are a serious environmental concern. Natural fibers can take years to decompose in landfills and can release greenhouse gases as they do so. Synthetic textiles are designed not to decompose at all and can leach toxic substances into the soil and groundwater while in landfills.

What Types of Textiles Can Be Recycled? Textiles that can be recycled typically either come from post-consumer or pre-consumer sources. Post-consumer textiles include garments, vehicle upholstery, towels, bedding, purses, and more. Pre-consumer textiles are by-products of yarn and fabric manufacture.

Before You Recycle Textiles

You don’t have to go directly to a textile recycler in order to give your old fabric items second lives. If your textiles are in good shape, you can resell or donate them. If they aren't usable, hand them over to a recycler who can break them down into fibers to create a ""new"" item.

Resell

If your textiles are in good shape, consider reselling them to secondhand stores to pass them down to be used and loved by another person before being recycled. You can sell your items at your local thrift store or consignment shop. Also consider selling them online through a reputable online reseller like thredUP, Poshmark, or eBay.

A majority of textile waste is clothing, which is becoming easier to resell as secondhand fashion grows in popularity.

Donate

Numerous nonprofits have textile donation programs that will accept your used (but still usable) textiles to resell at the organization’s second-hand stores. Goodwill and Salvation Army are popular donation spots, but other nonprofits have similar programs. Check with your favorite charity to see if they can reuse or resell your textiles before you recycle them.

Your local humane society or animal sanctuary may not have a storefront, but they can likely use donations of your old towels and blankets to keep their animals comfortable. Shelters and other organizations that support the homeless population will also typically accept donations of clothes, blankets, and various other textiles.

Brand Take-Back Programs

Some brands, like Nike and Patagonia, have take-back programs that allow customers to send in their used textiles of that brand for recycling or resale, depending on the quality.

After you clean out your closet and linen cabinet, look at the brands of your items and check with them to see if you can send them back. Some companies will send you a prepaid shipping label to make the process even easier.

Exportation Programs

Second-hand clothing is often a much-needed commodity in developing countries, especially after a devastating natural disaster. Many of the organizations that you may donate your used textiles to anyways, including Goodwill and Salvation Army, donate a portion of the textiles they receive to countries in need.

Other organizations have similar programs but accept specific items, like the organization Free The Girls, which accepts donations of bras for sex trafficking survivors in El Salvador, Mozambique, and Costa Rica to sell themselves at second-hand markets with the goal of becoming financially independent.

Textile Recycling

Unfortunately, almost no curbside pick-up recycling programs in the U.S. accept textiles, so you can’t just toss your used fabrics in the recycling bin. Instead, you’ll have to take them directly to a recycler or donation facility that will do the job for you.

Consider recycling your used textiles if they aren’t in good enough condition to resell or donate. If you aren’t sure, you may still be able to donate them to a thrift store or consignment shop—many will ask for your consent to recycle anything they can’t resell.

Many organizations and recyclers will take your used clothing and textile items to recycle them and turn them into a new item. Examples of items made from recycled textiles are:

Automobile cushions

Insulation

Paper

Wiping cloths

Carpet padding

Baseball filling

Pillow stuffing

Pet beds

Treehugger Tip Wash and thoroughly dry your textiles before recycling them, no matter what physical shape they’re in. Textiles with food waste and other grime on them may contaminate other textiles in the recycling process, which could clog up machinery and render the entire batch useless. Wet textiles can breed bacteria and pose a similar threat.

Ways to Reuse Textiles

There are plenty of ways you can reuse and repurpose your old textiles to give them a second life yourself. It’s advisable to consider options for reuse before recycling your textiles. While better than throwing your textiles in the trash, recycling them isn’t perfect as processing textiles consumes water and energy.

You can either donate your old textiles to an organization that will reuse them (children’s programs, animal rescues, etc.) or reuse them yourself. Your old fabrics make great crafting materials and can even be transformed into another, more functional item. Here are a few examples of projects to reuse your textiles:

Textile Waste and the Environment

Each year, the average U.S. citizen throws away an estimated 70 pounds of textiles. The EPA estimates that of the 17 million tons of textiles produced each year, nearly 85% ends up as trash.

Fast fashion, a term that describes a business model based on replicating trendy clothing designs and mass-producing them at a low cost, is one of the culprits behind this environmental dilemma.

Not only does fast fashion contribute to a staggering amount of textile waste, but it also emits greenhouse gases. Carbon emissions result from manufacturing, transporting garments from factories to retail outlets, and then transporting them to the individual consumer. And when the consumer eventually tosses the garment in the trash, the textiles can emit more greenhouse gases while they sit in landfills.

Recycling textiles is extremely important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to cut down on pollutants and waste in the environment. Look into the sustainable options detailed in this article before you get rid of your old textiles.

Then, when you go shopping for new textiles, consider sustainable alternatives. Look for textiles that are high-quality and can last you a long time. Prioritize companies that use sustainable materials like organic or recycled cotton. When possible, repair any damage to your textiles instead of swapping them for new items and consider shopping second-hand.

Since 2016, the company has been developing 100% recycled cotton yarns from cotton waste based on a process called RCO100. In 2021, through its ongoing partnership with fashion brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein Jeans and Lacoste, the company recycled a record-breaking 100,000 tons of pre-and-post-consumer cotton waste.

IIT: What is involved in the RCO100 process?

AH: It’s the first of it’s kind, and we use pre-consumer industrial waste and post-consumer cotton garment waste to produce 100% recycled OE cotton yarns up to Ne20 and ring compact yarns up to Ne30. Our RCO100 technology allows for a process which is all mechanical, with no chemistry, chemicals or regenerative fibres involved.

IIT: Where is the RCO100 cotton produced?

Our main RCO100 supply chain is in Turkey with our partner Kipas. We use mainly local pre-consumer industrial waste. Post-consumer we can import from the EU countries.

IIT: What certifications does it have?

AH: All of our RCO100 yarns and fabrics are GRS (Global Recycling Standard) certified and come with the respective transfer certificates. This applies to the supply chains as well. We also have Oeko Tex and ISO certifications.

IIT: How do you trace its progress through the supply chain and guarantee authenticity?

AH: Since the conception of RCO100 in 2016, traceability was an aspect which we were very invested in. We control the material sourcing process by using only GRS certified material suppliers and add our own audits. In addition, we work with the company Fibretrace which provides us with tracer technology to make our products unique in respect of traceability and block chain technology for the customer to trace back the RCO100 product through the whole supply chain. We are also working to collaborate with brands and their end consumers through interfaces that showcase the entire supply chain.

IIT: You are gradually introducing more post-consumer waste into products. What are the main hurdles and limitations to this at present, and how could they be overcome?

AH: Post consumer material is always a challenge because we only have limited knowledge about the original raw material and we do not know how many times the garments have been washed. Contamination is another issue. So we have to separate carefully and then blend accurately, using our extensive know-how and data base to achieve the best possible ratios and yarn results. By now we have six years of experience and big factor of RCO100 is of course our own developed and designed recycling system with a very gentle mechanical opening process, avoiding fibre damage as much as possible.

IIT: What are the chief advantages of being a Swiss-run company headquartered in Singapore?

AH: Mainly it is the connection between the European main markets and the textile centres in Asia. Singapore is like Switzerland! It is super efficient and a developed economy. To link the two bases we are able to speed up technologies and services for our customers and supply partners. Our Swiss DNA also keeps us grounded and in touch with nature – it’s an element we grew up with as a family and has translated into our work and products, especially now with RCO100.

IIT: Could you say a little about the formation of the company and its intentions – the where and why?

AH: Hailing from Switzerland and a family background of textile and engineering, my father Stefan has 30 years of experience in the textile industry. With a focus in Asia, he worked at Rieter and also as global sales director for Hualon Corporation. In 2005 he built up Säntis Textiles into a leading textiles company, initially for technical and home furnishing fabrics with locations in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey and additional sales offices in the UK, Germany and USA. His foray into sustainable and specifically recycled textiles came from a passion to find environmentally conscious solutions for both technical and garment fabrics. He started by developing recycling PET bottles for home furnishing solutions which eventually became commercially viable. Then in 2016 he went on to develop the technology for RCO100, which is still the only 100% mechanically recycled cotton fully commercialised on the market today. Säntis Textiles currently ships approximately eight million square metres of technical, home and RCO100 fabrics per month to the main markets – Turkey, Europe and USA. There is also interesting growth in the Asian market where quality approved fabrics are also become a big segment.

At heart, Säntis Textiles is still very much a family company. Following in the footsteps of my father, I have been leading RCO100 projects since 2020, liaising with brands and developing creative tailor-made solutions for brands to forge ahead with their recycling initiatives. Most recently, these projects have focused more on incorporating closed loop systems.

The core values of the company from the beginning were to provide a more holistic, personable connection between client and the product which results in higher quality and greater sustainability – an element which the textiles industry values now more than ever.

IIT: How many employees does the company have today?

AH: In all mentioned locations Säntis Textiles relies on a team of approx. 120 employees with approx. 90 engaged in quality control at the various production sites. At every stage Säntis Textiles provides its own quality control to assure top quality is shipped to its customers.

Southampton issues textile challenge in bid to limit waste,"Steve Dudek, an attendant at the Southampton Transfer Station, points to the clothing bins that sit near the entrance of the transfer station on Moose Brook Road. STAFF PHOTO/EMILY THURLOW

SOUTHAMPTON — Randall Kemp has been talking trash on Facebook for years and it would seem that some people are paying attention.

The Southampton highway superintendent and transfer station manager has been challenging townspeople on social media to divert clothing and fabrics from the waste stream and landfills, and instead choose to reuse/recycle items through donations to the D.A.R.E. bins at the town’s transfer station. In his posts, he provides updates as to how many pounds have been donated and encourages residents to “beat their best year” of donations and top 11,000 pounds of textiles in a single year.

“I have been posting periodic educational posts of this nature on our official town Facebook page and have been posting specifically about textiles all the way back to June of 2016. I think it’s a good way to motivate people,” he said. “We have been doing a great job here in Southampton as we have not had to raise user fees in the past three years. I urge residents to ask questions and do everything they can to minimize waste and we will continue to expand our operations where we are able to assist in this endeavor.”

Although the town’s vendor was not accepting textiles through much of the pandemic — which accounts for the sharp decline in 2020 — from 2019 to 2021, residents donated 21,975 pounds of textiles. Despite that, 2021 proved to be the third-highest amount of textiles diverted from the waste stream with 10,550 pounds.

From 2016 to 2021, the community has kept nearly 50,000 pounds of textiles out of the waste stream, according to Kemp. Though he has no data to back up his efforts, he said he’d like to attribute some of the success of the program to his social media presence.

The U.S. recycling industry recycles approximately 8 pounds of textiles per person each year, according to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries Inc. in Washington.

Residents and businesses in Massachusetts dispose of approximately 230,000 tons of usable clothing, footwear, linens and other textile products annually, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. By DEP’s estimate, about 95% of this material could be reused or recycled rather than being thrown away.

“Landfills are filling up fast and materials that can be reused, recycled or composted shouldn’t be taking up limited space within them,” Kemp said.

MassDEP has new regulations that will be coming down the pipeline on Nov. 1.

As part of the state agency’s final 2030 Solid Waste Master Plan, the DEP has established new goals to reduce disposal throughout the state by 30% over the next decade — from 5.7 million tons in 2018 to 4 million tons by 2030. The long-term goal of the plan is to achieve a 90% reduction in disposal to 570,000 tons by 2050.

To hit these marks, DEP will be adding textiles and mattresses to the list of materials that are banned from disposal or transport for disposal in the state.

As a condition of Southampton’s authorization to operate, which is issued by DEP, the town must abide by the state’s waste ban plan.

“… Not only is it advantageous for Southampton to be early adopters of the expanded waste bans that will come into effect Nov. 1 of this year, but presumably it will be cheaper in the long run as existing landfill space dwindles,” Kemp said.

As part of the state’s waste ban plan, DEP will also lower the threshold on commercial organic/food waste to facilities from one ton to a half-ton per week.

While the town does not accept commercial food waste at the transfer station, residential permit holders can utilize the station’s compost pile to drop off organic yard waste, such as leaves, twigs, weeds, grass clippings and coffee grounds.

In the past, Kemp has initiated a subsidized backyard household food waste composter program. Within four days of offering these composters, he sold out. He hopes to be able to offer more composters to residents in the spring.

Kemp also has aims to find a way to fund a purchase of a soil screener, so that the transfer station can offer finished compost produced to residents for their lawns and flowerbeds from the organics they drop off.

In the meantime, he’s challenging residents to make 2022 their best year yet.

“Clean out those closets and let’s see if we can have our biggest year yet for pounds of clothing and textiles kept out of landfills!” he said.

"Global Textile Recycling Market (2022 to 2027) - Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecasts","Dublin, Feb. 25, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Textile Recycling Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2022-2027"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The global textile recycling market reached a value of US$ 5.02 Billion in 2021. Looking forward, the publisher expects the market to reach US$ 5.86 Billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 2.6% during 2022-2027.

Keeping in mind the uncertainties of COVID-19, we are continuously tracking and evaluating the direct as well as the indirect influence of the pandemic on different end use industries. These insights are included in the report as a major market contributor.



Textile recycling refers to the method of reprocessing and reusing old clothing, scarps, and fibrous waste materials. Generally, these materials are recovered from discarded clothes, carpets, furniture, tires, footwear, and other non-durable goods, such as towels and sheets. Textile recycling offers several environmental and economic benefits, such as reducing land and water pollution, minimizing dependence on virgin fibers, curbing usage of chemical dyes, and optimum consumption of energy and water. In recent times, it has emerged as an effective method for sustainability development in the apparel industry. Owing to these benefits, recycled textiles find wide applications across several end-use industries, including apparel, home furnishings, and other industrial sectors, such as retail, automotive, mining, building, construction, etc.



The increasing demand for recycled textile is primarily driven by the rising environmental concerns towards the detrimental impact of waste incineration, heavy industrial discharges from textile mills, and depletion of raw materials, such as silk, wool, etc. Furthermore, the growing production of synthetic and polyester fabrics have led to the high emission levels of greenhouse gases, thereby fueling the need for recycled fabrics on a global level. Apart from this, the growing public awareness towards the importance of recycling old clothes coupled with the increasing number of collection bins for cloth sorting, have further propelled the market growth.

Additionally, various recycling companies are launching informative initiatives regarding textile recycling along with introducing door-to-door pickup programs for old garments. Furthermore, these companies are also adopting innovative strategies for picking up post-consumer clothing materials by installing attractive cloth bins in public places such as parking spaces, parks, shopping malls, walkways, and other high visibility locations. In addition to this, several technological upgradations supported by the rising penetration of automation in the recycled textile industry have also catalyzed the market growth.

California Launches Innovative Textiles Circularity Projects: Part 2,"California’s largest city – Los Angeles – prides itself for having what it sees as a culture that values sustainability and circularity. Setting aggressive landfill diversion and recycling goals; advancing product stewardship programs, and other environmentally-centered initiatives are at the heart of the work to support that culture; but like many municipalities, LA still has big trash problems, including massive quantities of textile waste. And as one of the largest garment manufacturing hubs in the U.S., much of that waste is generated at its own door.

LA is trying to curb the rapid pile up of the industry’s discards through a pilot, in partnership with California Product Stewardship Council (CPSC) and industry, to recover and recirculate materials from manufacturers, retailers, and commercial/institutional generators.

The project aims to demonstrate, and show the potential for, several practices: upcycling scraps to make new, one-of-a-kind pieces; fiber-to-fiber recycling, where material too small to upcycle is made into pellets to go into other textiles; and composting organic, untreated materials that can’t be salvaged for clothing.

There’s another hopeful ambition for down the road: developing a “textile hub,” which would be a centralized location to receive, recycle, repurpose, and distribute from.

LA pilot participant, Upcycle it Now, is a designer and manufacturer that makes accessories from postconsumer garments and manufacturers’ scraps.

“What we aim to do is work with businesses to create a circular flow. We recreate, and the company puts the product back on their shelves rather than make items out of virgin material,” says Christina Johnson, Upcycle it Now co-founder.

“We are small, but we’ve been at this for 11 years and have seen what works and what doesn’t,” says Johnson, who has worked on upcycling pilots with The North Face, Arc'teryx, and a few other outdoor clothing brands.

With this new LA project, Upcycle it Now is in the ideation phase, exploring for instance the possibility of making one-off pieces, maybe a tote bag or fanny pack, from used, worn uniforms that would otherwise have been discarded.

Comparing this work to more traditional manufacturing, Johnson says the latter is done on a linear trajectory. Extracted materials become a fabric. They go to cut and sew to make product, and then go to market. Upcycling does not follow that predictable, straight line.

“You have more stakeholders. You pull feedstock from more unconventional sources. And you have a lot more conversations. So it can be more work to make all the pieces fit, but there’s opportunity to be real resourceful as you try to determine where materials will come from and what you will do with them,” she says.

Similar to other small upcyclers, Johnson has flexibility not only in terms of what she can make, but with quantities she can work with. And she is open to design input, leaving the door open to possibilities.

“With this pilot, we have no specific market identified yet, but we have great ideas for unique pieces that we can possibly sell through a designer or a smaller brand and have it be a very cool kind of LA signature piece. Something with a local story rather than something bought at a department store. It comes from LA and was redesigned in LA to be a collector’s item,” she says.

Pilot participant California Cloth Foundry is a natural fashion and fabric manufacturer. It buys fibers from farmers; makes yarn to be spun into textiles; and has its own signature clothes, which are botanically dyed and botanically printed (using plant-based chemicals and materials).

The small operation has held onto its cutting room waste for a couple of years with the intention to eventually recycle it but hasn’t generated enough to be collected for that purpose. Through the pilot it’s tapping into another option: the scraps will be collected by Compostable LA who will process them and deliver the end product to a farm.

Because the material is plant-based with no harmful chemicals it should make good feedstock. Compostable LA has so far collected a couple hundred pounds of these scraps, including those mixed in with pattern paper. California Cloth Foundry will take back plastic, so its processing partner does not have to sort or dispose of it.

“CPSC will collect data on how our materials compost and how they impact soil, and we will too,” says Lydia Wendt, founder and CEO of California Cloth Foundry.

“This is soil, to skin, back to soil. So, whatever we are extracting from the earth to make our products can go back to the earth. I’m excited that our textiles, with food-grade ingredients, are going back into the soil to grow more food,” she says.

If it can be scaled, Wendt envisions potential for meaningful impact in the surrounding region, considering that California is a big agriculture state.

“We grow a lot of food. That’s what our state does so well. So, we are taking waste generated in California and turning it into something beneficial for our soil,” she says.

As part of the LA project, the city envisions developing an online database to facilitate exchanges between manufacturers, textiles processors, and haulers involved with repurposing and reuse, but is also looking into the economic feasibility of a physical “textiles hub” where recovery, repair/repurposing can take place.

CPSC is conducting the feasibility study and also developing a map of reuse, repair, and recycling service providers as a first step to an online platform, or these identified providers can be part of the physical “hub” should it materialize, says Joanne Brasch, special projects manager, California Product Stewardship Council.

The project has accomplished a lot to date, says Michael Simpson, division manager, LA Sanitation and Environment, circular leader.

“We’ve collected a lot of data on characteristics of the city’s textiles waste stream; identified processes for use of this discarded material; and in a couple of months, we should have a concept report for a possible physical textiles hub,” he says.

“We want to make our city more livable and reduce the climate impact of textiles. [As part of that] we will work with our textile producers, sorters, and other providers to find a unique way to put manufacturing surplus into a circular economy and at the same time divert from landfill, and hopefully increase our green jobs. There are social, environmental, and economic benefits to using circular principals to recycle and repurpose this material.”",,[],[]
New nonprofit takes on textile waste in Butler County,"OXFORD, Ohio — As crate after crate stacks up at her small stand, Shana Rosenberg sorts through sweaters, coats, jeans and T-shirts of all sizes. It’s always a wide selection because she never knows what her visitors may need.

Rosenberg calls these stands clothing swaps, offering her collection of clothes for free or a small suggested donation of more clothing she can share because, for her, the priority is keeping these textiles out of the trash.

What You Need To Know Thread Up Oxford works to reduce clothing waste in Butler County



Shana Rosenberg sorts through donated and unwanted textiles to find ways to reuse or share them



Textiles that can’t be reused are recycled



84% of the clothes Americans purchase end up in landfills

“I actually a few years ago got really interested in textile waste reduction because I found out how much ended up in a landfill,” Rosenberg said.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 84% of the clothing Americans buy will end up there, making up more than 5% of municipal waste. The volume has more than doubled since 1990.

All of that waste takes up to 200 years to decompose, often leaking dangerous chemicals from dyes into soil and water during the process. The United Nations Environment Program estimates the fashion industry is responsible for 2-8% of global carbon emissions.

Rosenberg blames a trend called “fast fashion” or cheap, trendy clothing made for increasingly short fashion seasons, often without the durability to last longer than a few months-worth of wears.

Thread Up Oxford formed as an alternative.

“There was a lot of Facebook conversation last year about a community-wide clothing swap,” Rosenberg said. “Then it kind of snowballed.”

She started with a clothing drive over the summer, asking for any unwanted textiles in any condition.

“Not just clothing — fabrics, scraps, bedding, blankets (and) just you know, tons and tons of stuff,” Rosenberg said.

By the end of the drive, Rosenberg had thousands of pounds of fabric to sort through. The good stuff, she sorted by size and style to go back out in her monthly clothing swaps. The rest she looked for alternative ways to put it to use.

“Whether that’s using really tiny scraps to stuff something with or I’ve given a lot of towels that are not in good shape to veterinary clinics,” she said.

Going through donations at her latest drive, Rosenberg showed an example a canvas bag with a few stains.

“Something like this I would probably look at it and say this is probably not something that I would give to folks in the community,” she said.

Though she said the bag has a lot worth keeping. Its leather straps were in perfectly good condition and so was the small dog decal sewn on the front.

“I would absolutely take this dog off to like use for some other up-cycling project,” she said.

Rosenberg gives away excess fabric to quilters and others interested in free material for sewing projects. Anything she can’t figure out how to repurpose or reuse, she takes to specialized recycling drop offs.

“For both fiber recycling and then the dish rag and cleaning cloth industry,” she said.

Only a few months old, Thread Up Oxford is still in its infancy. Rosenberg has taken on the effort full time, but she said the group still has a lot of room to grow. She said she’s in the process of applying to get 501c3 status so Thread Up Oxford can apply for grants and seek more partners.

Right now, she said most of the work the organization can do comes from people donating their time and services, otherwise, it comes out of her pocket.

“I know I’m going to take a loss for at least a year,” Rosenberg said.

Even so, she believes the mission is worthwhile, especially if she can spread awareness about textile waste throughout Butler County. That’s why at every swap, Rosenberg hands out flyers explaining Thread Up Oxford’s work and how anyone can help.

“Everything that we do we want to have this educational component and outreach component,” she said.

Thread Up Oxford plans to host clothing swaps at least once a month, while also organizing seasonal events throughout the community. Currently, the group is joining with the Talawanda Oxford Pantry and Social Services mobile pantry services on the first Thursday of every month at the Parkview Arms Apartments.",,[],"['Michelle Alfini', 'Published Am Et Oct.']"
California Launches Innovative Textiles Circularity Projects: Part 1,"About 1.2 million tons of California’s textiles are landfilled a year, and some of that state’s eco-reform backers are calling for legislation to stop the pile up, including of clothes. They want manufacturers and retailers to pay into repair and local reuse programs. California Product Stewardship Council (CPSC) is taking a lead role in the policy push, and as part of that is facilitating four publicly funded textile projects focused on repair and reuse (and other options when materials can’t go back into textiles).

The ambition is to prove out models that support circularity and ease the load on municipalities that are left to manage most of the discards.

“We are working to capture data and to be able to present case studies through these projects that exemplify what we are trying to promote with policy,” says Joanne Brasch, special projects manager, California Product Stewardship Council.

The participating jurisdictions— Los Angeles City, Los Angeles County, San Francisco, and Alameda County – already have established infrastructure for reuse and repair and were chosen to ideally be able to do the most, the quickest, and cheapest. Each project and its participants work differently.

The City and County of San Francisco are doing a garment repair pilot with Goodwill to train staff there in source separating salvageable materials into categories, from clothes simply needing to be ironed to those in such disrepair that only scraps could be recovered for upcycling. The materials will be picked up and processed by vendors, including luxury upcyclers, leather experts, designers, and commercial laundries; then the refurbished goods will be returned to Goodwill to sell.

“Thrift stores have become the stewards for presorting unwanted items; they are basically left to function as waste managers. But they don’t have much support for repair and upcycling damaged goods to ensure they are kept out of the landfill,” Brasch says.

Meanwhile, an entire infrastructure for garment repair exists that includes local dry-cleaners, tailors, designers, upholsterers, artists, and other innovators.

“San Francisco is interested in textile waste because it is a huge drain on our refuse management system. Unwanted textiles that show up through our collection systems are generally soiled and unmarketable. They create problems on our sorting lines and our collection equipment. And, of course, wind up costing the city and our ratepayers,” says Shawn Rosenmoss, senior Environmental Specialist Development, Community Partnerships, SF Carbon Fund, San Francisco Department of the Environment.

The agency completed a characterization study in 2020, finding San Francisco City and County were processing 10,000 to 15,000 tons per year of thrown-out clothes.

The county and city are waiting to see if the work being modeled through Goodwill is scalable, cost effective, and creates new workforce development opportunities.

In addition, says Rosenmoss, “We are hoping that this project may lead to policy recommendations at both the municipal and state level. And personally, I really hope it helps people understand things like, ‘Oh, I can sew on a new button and still use this.’ Or ‘I can have this zipper repaired and still wear this.’”

​In LA City and County, the projects are similar to each other, with the primary difference being the city is focusing largely on discards of brands and retailers, while the county is focusing on materials from commercial/institutional generators like hotels, hospitals, and detention centers.

The LA project involves working with partners to upcycle materials that can go back into textile products; fiber-to-fiber recycling for scraps too small to upcycle that can eventually go back into other textiles; and composting organic fibers when materials can’t be made or remade into clothing.

Designated haulers will take materials to the subcontracted processors, such as universities that will incorporate the materials into student projects.

CPSC has done interviews and surveys of generators, processors, haulers, and other stakeholders as well as characterization studies to assess the amount of overall textile waste, the amount of specific materials (polyester, cotton, etc), and to identify where they came from.

“We are gathering this data to know what we are dealing with so we can hopefully one day build a textile hub [which is just proof of concept now]. It would be a centralized place to bring material and recycle, repurpose, and distribute from,” says Michael Simpson, division manager, LA Sanitation and Environment, circular leader. LA San got a grant for the city pilot and brought CPSC on as a subcontractor to help the agency scale.

In Alameda County the work entails updating and expanding textile/recovery and repair vendor listings in a resource database, owned and operated by StopWaste, a public agency who is the grantor of the project. Known as RE:Source, the database has a search tool enabling residents in several counties to learn what they can do with belongings they no longer want, from household appliances to furniture to food for donation among others.

The project will add about 60 more vendors in the textile reuse and repair category; all of which are direct-to-consumer (residential) services.

The grant will also fund outreach materials with graphics and videos to inform the public on options to repair or reuse their textiles.

“Those materials will be used on our website as well as in the RE:Source database to help consumers understand more details about the problems with textiles and textile waste within the state,” says Jeanine Sidran, senior program services specialist, StopWaste.

Says Meri Soll, senior program manager, StopWaste, the established database structure allows for the easy addition of categories, such as new types of textiles and new textiles services.

“The hard part is doing the research to find out who accepts textiles for recovery and what they do with them. Our collaboration with CPSC and the grant funding will greatly expand the information and resources that users have access to.”

Google Analytics has clothing in the top five search items in RE:Source. Soll expects the searches to dramatically increase once the outreach materials and vendors are added.

Brasch is hoping these four projects will pave the way for more like them, as well as make a sound argument for policy around textile waste that calls on producers to help advance a circular economy. Already there’s been some movement in a couple of jurisdictions, most recently (Dec 2021), Los Angeles’ city council passed a comprehensive plastics strategy that includes extended producer responsibility/product stewardship policy goals for textiles, coupled with a commercial disposal ban.

“We are trying to get textiles out of landfills locally and internationally. But the other thing is getting these beautiful garments back into circulation,” Brash says.",,[],[]

Every year, millions of tons of textiles are wasted during the fashion industry’s design and production processes. Typically, that excess, unused material ends up in landfills, releasing greenhouse gases and polluting soil and nearby water with dyes and finishing products. (The most recent data shows that 11.3 million tons of textiles ended up in landfills in 2018.)

To help curb negative environmental impact and redistribute reusable material, FABSCRAP — a textile sustainability nonprofit founded in New York City in 2016 — has been reclaiming fabric waste from over 500 brand names, including Oscar de la Renta, J.Crew and URBN, then recycling or selling it for reuse. And this past Monday, they expanded operations by opening their second warehouse location in Philly, right inside the Bok Building.

We chatted with co-founders Jessica Schreiber and Camille Tagle about how FABSCRAP works, plus what opening in Philly means for local designers, consumers and the environment.

How did the two of you become interested in reducing textile waste?

Schreiber: I went to Columbia University for graduate school and studied climate science and policy. While there, I interned at the Bureau of Recycling and Sustainability at the NYC Department of Sanitation, as I was really interested in recycling, waste, and resource use. At the time, New York City had just launched its textile recycling program, Refashion NYC. After my internship, I was hired to manage and grow that e-waste program.

Toward the start of my five-year tenure there, big-name fashion brands began reaching out to me and asking what they should do with their textile waste from the design process. I found there was no place to send them. The city was partnering with GoodWill and Salvation Army, but you don’t really go to those organizations for a roll of silk or a bolt of wool. About 30 brands reached out, so I realized this was an industry problem. I launched a working group in which those brands shared info about their waste — how much they were creating, how often, and what kind — and that basically became a focus group for FABSCRAP. In 2016, I pitched the idea on Project Runway: Fashion Startup, and that’s how we got our first official donations to launch.

Tagle: After going to UCLA for undergrad, I studied design at the Fashion Institute of Technology, then began working in the fashion industry — specifically, eveningwear for luxury design houses. But I saw how much waste was accumulating from each collection season after season. It made me wonder where all of the excess and discarded fabric was going. The single-use operation just kind of got to me, especially because so much of the fabric that goes to waste is reusable. (At FABSCRAP, nearly 60 percent of what we receive is reusable.) All of this made me pause and ask myself what I wanted my contribution to this industry and to our world to be: Add to landfills, or pivot and be part of a sustainable solution?

What was FABSCRAP like in its early stages?

Schreiber: FABSCRAP was given nonprofit status in September 2016, and a few months later, found space in Jamaica/Queens in part of a warehouse used by underwear-manufacturing company Hanky Panky. They were so supportive of us, and we like to think of that space as a kind of mini incubator for the business. That’s also around the time we first had volunteers come in to help sort through material.

The two of us met kind of serendipitously at the end of 2017 and began hosting a few pop-up fabric sales together. Camille [Tagle] came on full-time as co-founder in January of 2018, which grew our ability to redistribute fabric and set up our first reuse store — which is basically our fabric thrift store — move out of Hanky Panky’s space and into the Brooklyn Army Terminal (which is still our New York City space), and eventually open our second retail location across from FIT.

How did you find your way to Philly?

Schreiber: In January of 2020, we were spending a lot of time out in L.A. We were aiming for a West Coast location, but then COVID happened and our plans went awry. But toward the end of last year, we started having deeper conversations with URBN, who had been shipping us materials from Philly to New York the past few years. Those conversations are really what led us to deciding on Philly as our second location, and Bok is such a hub for creators. URBN gave us a grant to secure our Bok spot and will provide general operating funds during our first two years here.

Tagle: We also have strong relationships with fashion schools in the area, specifically Drexel, Moore and Thomas Jefferson. For the past few years, we’ve partnered with Drexel’s fashion program, as it integrates sustainability courses and is really focused on modernizing design techniques. So for the senior and graduate collections, we determine the fabrics that’ll be given to those students, then students must create a garment made from zero-waste patterning — meaning that all the fabric must be used for the design. These constraints force students to not only think outside the box, but also exercise their creative talents from a more sustainable approach.

How does the FABSCRAP process work?

Schreiber: When there’s a company needing help with their textile waste, they’ll contact FABSCRAP via email or our online form, and we’ll follow-up with a service agreement. Even though we’re a nonprofit, having that fee is important because this isn’t public waste, so it holds the industry itself more accountable. It brings the waste into the brand’s bottom line.

We then provide the company with FABSCRAP bags, in which they put all their excess materials — leather, buttons, zippers, trims, full rolls of material and the like. They submit a pick-up form online. We’re there within five business days and bring everything back to our warehouse to weigh and sort.

Why do you weigh the material?

Schreiber: This is part of our commitment to sustainability. Every brand gets an environmental impact report that lets them know what their total diversion was as well as their CO2 savings. (Ed. Note: In 2020 alone, FABSCRAP helped save nearly 1,300 tons of CO2 — an equivalent of 19,352 trees planted.)

Okay, then you have to go through alllll the received material.

Tagle: We sort everything with volunteer help. Currently, we run volunteer sessions twice per day, five times per week. At our Bok location, we’re able to host 16 to 20 volunteers at a time. They’re sorting for recycling — small pieces that we can’t reuse and end up becoming insulation, mattress stuffing or carpet padding — and reuse, which gets moved to our retail shop. Since launching, we’ve had over 7,000 people volunteer with us, but we have an ongoing call for volunteers!

Can you talk more about your fabric thrift shop? Who is allowed to buy from it, and how much does material cost?

Tagle: Our retail shop is open to anyone who needs material for creative projects. Our customers run the creative gambit: fashion students, home sewers, interior designers, costume designers, puppet and stuffed-animal-makers, and Etsy sellers who are doing cross-stitching and embroidery.

We have a ton of different materials for sale: scraps of fabric, material on rolls that can be cut by the yard, cuttings passed between textile mills and designers for approval during the design process, belts, leather hides, buckles, buttons — really anything. We price by weight, by yard, or sometimes by piece. For example, something cut off a roll could range from $5 to $18 depending on yardage, while other things like buttons are priced by weight at $5 per pound. We also have a pay-what-you-wish per-yard option for a selection of rolls.

What do you anticipate your impact on Philly being?

Schreiber: We’re looking forward to building more relationships with the Philly community, and getting to know and collaborating with more local creators and artists. We’re already in conversation with Philly Fashion Week, and will continue working with local schools to support their programs. In January, we’ll launch our Featured Artist/Featured Designer program in Philly, which is a three-month residency where we highlight a local maker who is upcycling or using FABSCRAP fabric in their work. Their designs will be available for sale in our warehouse and online. Our first featured Philly designer is Grant BLVD.

What about FABSCRAP as a whole? How do you see it evolving?

Schreiber: We spend a lot of team time on education and outreach — guest speaking, digital workshops, skill-sharing events for local makers — to raise awareness that textile waste isn’t just what people use and discard, it’s also created by businesses, meaning companies have a responsibility to help reduce the amount of waste. That’s why, in the future, we’d like to have our brand partners bring their mills to the table so we can re-evaluate how fabrics are sampled and shared during the design process.

Tagle: The best way to keep this material out of landfills and combat climate change (which is really our overarching goal) is to get everyone on board in redistributing and continuing the life of the material — and a large part of that comes from holding brands accountable in ways that truly make an impact.",,[],"['Health', 'Wellness Editor', ""I'M A Scraper""]"
