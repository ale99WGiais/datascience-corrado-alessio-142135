Plastic Recycling Doesn’t Work and Will Never Work,"Americans support recycling. We do too. But although some materials can be effectively recycled and safely made from recycled content, plastics cannot. Plastic recycling does not work and will never work. The United States in 2021 had a dismal recycling rate of about 5 percent for post-consumer plastic waste, down from a high of 9.5 percent in 2014, when the U.S. exported millions of tons of plastic waste to China and counted it as recycled—even though much of it wasn’t.

Recycling in general can be an effective way to reclaim natural material resources. The U.S.’s high recycling rate of paper, 68 percent, proves this point. The problem with recycling plastic lies not with the concept or process but with the material itself.

The first problem is that there are thousands of different plastics, each with its own composition and characteristics. They all include different chemical additives and colorants that cannot be recycled together, making it impossible to sort the trillions of pieces of plastics into separate types for processing. For example, polyethylene terephthalate (PET#1) bottles cannot be recycled with PET#1 clamshells, which are a different PET#1 material, and green PET#1 bottles cannot be recycled with clear PET#1 bottles (which is why South Korea has outlawed colored PET#1 bottles.) High-density polyethylene (HDPE#2), polyvinyl chloride (PVC#3), low-density polyethylene (LDPE#4), polypropylene (PP#5), and polystyrene (PS#6) all must be separated for recycling.

Just one fast-food meal can involve many different types of single-use plastic, including PET#1, HDPE#2, LDPE#4, PP#5, and PS#6 cups, lids, clamshells, trays, bags, and cutlery, which cannot be recycled together. This is one of several reasons why plastic fast-food service items cannot be legitimately claimed as recyclable in the U.S.

Another problem is that the reprocessing of plastic waste—when possible at all—is wasteful. Plastic is flammable, and the risk of fires at plastic-recycling facilities affects neighboring communities—many of which are located in low-income communities or communities of color.

Unlike metal and glass, plastics are not inert. Plastic products can include toxic additives and absorb chemicals, and are generally collected in curbside bins filled with possibly dangerous materials such as plastic pesticide containers. According to a report published by the Canadian government, toxicity risks in recycled plastic prohibit “the vast majority of plastic products and packaging produced” from being recycled into food-grade packaging.

Yet another problem is that plastic recycling is simply not economical. Recycled plastic costs more than new plastic because collecting, sorting, transporting, and reprocessing plastic waste is exorbitantly expensive. The petrochemical industry is rapidly expanding, which will further lower the cost of new plastic.

Despite this stark failure, the plastics industry has waged a decades-long campaign to perpetuate the myth that the material is recyclable. This campaign is reminiscent of the tobacco industry’s efforts to convince smokers that filtered cigarettes are healthier than unfiltered cigarettes.

Conventional mechanical recycling, in which plastic waste is ground up and melted, has been around for many decades. Now the plastics industry is touting the benefits of so-called chemical recycling— in which plastic waste is broken down using high heat or more chemicals and turned into a low-quality fossil fuel.

In 2018, Dow Chemical claimed that the Renewlogy chemical-recycling plant in Salt Lake City was able to reprocess mixed plastic waste from Boise, Idaho, households through the “Hefty EnergyBag” program and turn it into diesel fuel. As Reuters exposed in a 2021 investigation, however, all the different types of plastic waste contaminated the pyrolysis process. Today, Boise burns its mixed plastic waste in cement kilns, resulting in climate-warming carbon emissions. This well-documented Renewlogy failure has not stopped the plastics industry from continuing to claim that chemical recycling works for “mixed plastics.”

Chemical recycling is not viable. It has failed and will continue to fail for the same down-to-earth, real-world reasons that the conventional mechanical recycling of plastics has consistently failed. Worse yet, its toxic emissions could cause new harm to our environment, climate, and health.

We’re not making a case for despair. Just the opposite. We need the facts so that individuals and policy makers can take concrete action. Proven solutions to the U.S.’s plastic-waste and pollution problems exist and can be quickly replicated across the country. These solutions include enacting bans on single-use plastic bags and unrecyclable single-use plastic food-service products, ensuring widespread access to water-refilling stations, installing dishwashing equipment in schools to allow students to eat food on real dishes rather than single-use plastics, and switching Meals on Wheels and other meal-delivery programs from disposables to reusable dishware.

If the plastics industry is following the tobacco industry’s playbook, it may never admit to the failure of plastics recycling. Although we may not be able to stop them from trying to fool us, we can pass effective laws to make real progress. Single-use-plastic bans reduce waste, save taxpayer money spent on disposal and cleanup, and reduce plastic pollution in the environment.

Consumers can put pressure on companies to stop filling store shelves with single-use plastics by not buying them and instead choosing reusables and products in better packaging. And we should all keep recycling our paper, boxes, cans, and glass, because that actually works.",,[],"['Judith Enck', 'Jan Dell', 'About The Authors']"

Nature’s Painters: Making Sustainable Colors with Microbes,"The production of textile dyes and food colorants can have a big environmental footprint. Biotech startups are rising to the challenge by engineering bacteria, fungi, and algae to sustainably produce natural colors.

Eight years ago, University of Cambridge researcher Jim Ajioka was in Nepal helping to produce a biosensor to detect arsenic in drinking water and was shocked at how poor the water quality was in the region.

“In Kathmandu, all of the textile industry just dumps its waste straight into the water and into the river… there’s almost no regulation,” Ajioka told me. “The other place that I went to was Dhaka in Bangladesh… and again, it’s exactly the same problem.”

While historically many dyes came from natural sources, the first synthetic color, a shade of purple called mauveine, was produced by accident in 1856 using petrochemical techniques. Now, around 99% of dyes come from petroleum and fossil fuel sources because they are generally quicker, easier, and cheaper to produce than natural dyes.

Seeing the impact of the fashion industry on the water in Nepal and Bangladesh inspired Ajioka and his colleague Orr Yarkoni to found Colorifix. This UK-based biotech company focuses on creating sustainable fabric dyes by genetically modifying microbes to produce a variety of natural pigments.

Around 300 million people work in the fashion industry, many of whom are low-paid workers in developing countries like Bangladesh and Nepal. Chemical dyes used in the industry are often toxic. Not only do they come from unsustainable sources, but many workers are at increased risk for skin diseases and cancer from regular exposure to these dyes.

“Dyeing and rinsing fabric with chemical dyes also requires a lot of water – about 20% of global water pollution stems from the textile industry,” said Renana Krebs. She graduated from university with a degree in fashion in 2011 and then worked as a designer for elite fashion companies in the UK and Germany. “I had an amazing job and was passionate about my work, but at the same time I saw behind the scenes of the industry. I saw how they treated the workers.”

“I’ve been in the Far East and saw rivers in the colors of the next season. You can’t see that and just do nothing. People thought I was crazy, but I quit my job and did a Master’s in sustainable design.”

Since then Krebs has found a new calling as a biotech CEO. She co-founded Algaeing (previously Alga-Life) with her father Oded Krebs in 2016. Split between Berlin and Israel, the company focuses on making sustainable dyes and cloth out of algae.

“All of our colors are made from algae. Some algae can even produce multiple colors. Think of leaves: in summer they’re green, then in autumn they become brownish or orange,” says Krebs, who emphasizes that they don’t harvest algae from the ocean or wild water sources. “The algae grow in a closed-loop vertical farming system with zero waste and no use of agricultural land, powered by solar energy.”

French biotech Pili Bio is also using microbes to produce sustainable fabric dyes. The company had an unconventional start in an abandoned train hangar turned community laboratory.

“We came from a ‘bio-hackerspace’ rather than a conventional academic lab. A biological discovery is not at the origin of the company, but we wanted to tackle an environmental problem and we gathered the resources and talents little by little to solve it,” says company CEO Jérémie Blache, who himself comes from a business background.

The company started as four students with an idea and a proof of concept in 2015 and is now a team of 26. Blache says that the next challenge for the company is to “finance and build the first production factory of biobased colors.”

Bacteria, fungi, and algae have been producing natural pigments for millennia. But our ability to exploit these organisms at an industrial scale has only been made possible in recent years thanks to synthetic biology techniques.

“One of the things people ought to realize is, none of this is magic. It’s just an observation of biology,” says Ajioka. “Everybody’s seen this. When you go around your house, you see mold, mildew, or red stains on your tiles in the bathroom, because there are microorganisms living there and they’re making pigments and depositing them on the surface.”

However, there are several challenges associated with introducing a new, sustainable dying process to a large and well-established industry.

“We wanted to make sure that everything that we did had the lowest travel footprint possible,” says Ajioka. “We designed and built our own fermenters to be suitable for working in a dye house environment.”

He explained that although initially advised against it, going down this route has allowed the company to maintain consistency of its dyeing processes and reduce its carbon footprint. Their fermentors are also cheap compared with others available on the market. “They’re about a fifth of the cost. We can undercut the competition. It helps in standardization, because we can make things cost-effective.”

Colorifix is helping dye houses perform the whole dying process in a fermentor on site. Other companies are developing pigments using microbes, which they then supply to dye houses to use instead of conventional dyes. While just providing the pigment is theoretically simpler, it is a less sustainable alternative since it still requires all of the other chemicals used in the dyeing process.

Sustainable colors in food

The production of synthetic food colorants can also be a source of pollution. But natural food colorants are not without problems. Some rely on extracts from vegetables such as beetroot and carrots, which can take up large amounts of agricultural growing space.

“We believe there’s a better way to do that, and a more efficient way to do that via fermentation,” said Gerit Tolborg, CEO and co-founder of Chromalogics, a Danish biotech aiming to solve this problem.

“Instead of using these high value raw materials that you could also use to feed people, the argument is for moving the production of natural food colorings to the lab. You only use sugar as [a raw material], you have a very efficient conversion, and you can even use the byproducts and put them back on the field for fertilizing.”

The science behind Chromalogics is based on Tolborg’s PhD project, during which she was able to isolate a red pigment from a rare fungus, Talaromyces atroroseus. “We were able to isolate the pigments, then we learned that there were novel pigments that have never been described before, [which] opened our patent opportunity.”

Red food coloring is high in demand, making up 50% of all food colorings, according to Tolborg. There is currently a gap in the market, as most food and drink manufacturers want to stay away from artificial colorings. At the same time, they don’t want to use carmine, the current best natural red food coloring, as it is made from beetles and therefore not vegetarian.

Chromalogics was set up in 2017 to develop an alternative food colorant. Since then, Tolborg and colleagues have been working hard at testing the toxicity and stability of their pigment, as well as tackling the industrial scale-up problem. But the biggest challenge will undoubtedly be getting approval from both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), admits Tolborg.

“There’s just so much out of our hands… We have a lot of data that indicates it’s not toxic, but we’ll only know once the authorities say yes, you can use it.”

Another company using fermentation to produce food colors is Israeli startup Phytolon. The firm is engineering yeast to produce betalain pigments, which are naturally found in beetroot and other purple and red vegetables and flowers.

“Companies like Starbucks stopped using carmine, Campari stopped using carmine, but they still need a stable color. They don’t really have that because the [alternatives] are just not stable enough. And that’s the gap,” says Tolborg.

A future of sustainable colors

With increasing consumer interest in achieving a circular economy, big players in the fashion and food industries are more interested than ever before in becoming more sustainable.

“Extra-financial objectives are timidly implemented in companies, which helps to move away from projects focused on pure performance or cost reduction,” says Blache. “But the ones who make the biggest difference in my eyes are the executives who dare to adopt sustainable products, even if they are not yet competitive in terms of price. They allow offers like ours to emerge.”

As many of these biotech companies are relatively new, there are still some hurdles to overcome. For example, some colors are easier than others to produce. Ajioka says he and his colleagues are on a quest to make a good quality black dye from melanin extracted from fungi. “Black is actually a hard color to make, because it’s usually a mix of different colors to cover the [light] spectrum. There actually isn’t a lot of research on how it works, all we can do is try to mimic the processes that happen, for example, in fungi.”

Other challenges are more on the business end, such as persuading conventional dye houses or food manufacturers to take a chance on a new process, as well as keeping the costs affordable for the industry.

While the fashion and food industries are only at the early stages of implementing true sustainability, Krebs thinks this will become more important as time goes on.

“Sustainability used to be a ‘nice to have’, now it’s a ‘must’. I believe that companies that aren’t going to change are not going to remain a part of this industry. We need to look at the bigger picture of how this world is going to survive. For a real systematic change, solutions need to be economical, and proven to work for people and the planet.”",,[],['Helen Albert']
Highly efficient and simultaneous catalytic reduction of multiple toxic dyes and nitrophenols waste water using highly active bimetallic PdO–NiO nanocomposite,"The crystalline nature and phase purity of the synthesized NiO, PdO and PdO–NiO nanocomposite were confirmed by XRD analysis and shown in Fig. 1a. All three XRD patterns show the highly crystalline nature, which confirms the purity of the samples. In PdO–NiO mixed metal oxide, The intense diffraction peaks at 2θ = 37.16, 43.24, 62.81, 75.32 and 79.34° indexed to (101), (012), (110), (113) and (202) planes of the cubic phase of NiO, which is highly consistent with standard JCPDS NO: 01-071-475120. On the other hand, the sharp peaks at 2θ = 34.54 and 55.79° indexed to (101) and (112) planes corresponding to the tetragonal crystalline phase of PdO with an average lattice parameter 3.043 Å, which is highly associated with standard JCPDS NO: 043-102421. Interestingly, metallic diffraction peaks and other impurity phases were not observed in the hybrid PdO–NiO nanocomposite. This confirming that metal source (Pd) completely oxidized to the metal oxide (PdO) and formed hybrid PdO–NiO nanocomposite. In addition, the single metal oxide (PdO, NiO) diffraction patterns were compared in Fig. 1a.

Figure 1 (a) X-ray diffraction pattern and (b) FTIR spectra of NiO, PdO and PdO–NiO (c) TGA curve of PdO–NiO nanocomposite. Full size image

The sharp peaks of each metal oxide confirm the high crystallinity of the tetragonal phase of the PdO and cubic phase of NiO. Both diffraction pattern of the single metal oxides is well associated with standard JCPDS file: 01-071-4751 and 043-1024 respectively. The average crystallite size, micro-strains of the NiO, PdO and PdO doped NiO were calculated by using Scherrer analysis and W–H analysis and plotted in Fig. 1b. A small variation was observed in the crystallite size of the catalysts (PdO, NiO and PdO–NiO) in Fig. 1b, which is due to the difference in the distribution of the crystal in the catalysts. The average crystallite size of the PdO, NiO and PdO–NiO was found to be 10.8, 7.8 and 7.36 nm, respectively. The PdO doping reduces the crystallite size in the PdO–NiO composite, consistent with previous reports. The calculated crystallite sizes, d-spacing, micro-strains, and binding energies of the PdO, NiO, and PdO–NiO are shown in the Table 1. In addition, the experimentally calculated d-spacing value of the pure PdO and NiO was well correlated with theoretical values and shown in Table SI. 1. The synthesized catalyst showed the negative and positive slopes of ε are corresponds to the compressive and tensile stress, respectively.

Furthermore, the chemical bonding and functional groups were analyzed by FTIR spectrometer. Figure 1c show FTIR spectra of the synthesized NiO, PdO and PdO–NiO nanocomposite. Similar spectra were observed for the three catalyst, the absorption peaks at high-frequency region 3200–3400 cm−1 belongs to O–H stretching vibration of the water molecules, due to surface adsorption phenomenon. Furthermore, three absorption peaks appeared at 1398.2, 1237.8 and 1057.8 cm−1, which ascribed to the C–O, CH 2 and C=O stretching vibrations, which is well associated with XPS analysis data. The metal oxide bonding peaks appeared in the frequency range of 480.2–702.6 cm−1. Hence the Pd–O and Ni–O stretching frequency in the PdO doped NiO sample confirmed the formation of hybrid PdO–NiO nanocomposite22. After that, the thermal stability of the PdO–NiO nanocomposite was studied by TGA analysis. Figure 1d shows the thermogram of the PdO–NiO nanocomposite. The first weight loss (7%) started in the temperature range of 65 to 180 °C. Due to the H2O molecules, evaporation and then the sustainable weight loss of around 10% was observed in the range of 187 to 574 °C. Beyond 600 °C a significant weight loss 20% was observed, which may be assigned to the unreacted CO 3 combustion23. Hence, the XRD, FTIR and TGA spectral studies confirmed the formation of hybrid PdO–NiO nanocomposite.

The electronic state and chemical bonding of the PdO doped NiO composite was analyzed by using XPS spectra. Figure 2 shows the XPS spectra of the PdO–NiO nanocomposite, the broad scan spectrum (Fig. SI. 1) of the PdO–NiO, which show the existence of the Pd (3d), Ni (2p), O (1s) and C(1s) elements. The deconvoluted Pd 3d XPS spectrum in Fig. 2a shows two major peaks at a binding energy of 336.4 and 342.2 eV corresponds to spin–orbit doublets of Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2, respectively, which confirmed Pd2+ ions in the form of PdO in the PdO–NiO nanocomposite24,25. In addition, the satellite peak of Pd species appeared at a binding energy of 339.2 eV and 345.3 eV. In Ni 2p spectra (Fig. 2b), Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p3/2 spin–orbit doublets peaks were observed at 854.9 eV and 872.5 eV, which corresponded to Ni–O and Ni–OH, respectively and their corresponding satellite peaks are located at a binding energy of 867.2 eV and 879.1 eV26,27. Furthermore, O 1s spectra (Fig. 2c) show the two peaks at a binding energy of 529.3 eV and 534.2 eV, which ascribed M–O and M–OH species. The obtained XPS spectra of the PdO–NiO nanocomposite are well associated with the XRD and EDX analysis.

The morphology feature and elemental composition of the prepared NiO, PdO and PdO–NiO nanocomposite was scrutinised by FE-SEM. Figure 3 shows the SEM morphology images of NiO, PdO and PdO–NiO nanocomposite at low and high magnification. Pure metal oxides NiO and PdO samples in Fig. 3a–d shows the porous crystalline morphology with high purity of the respective elements. On the other hand, PdO doped NiO sample in Fig. 3e,f shows the uniform, monodisperse, spherical crystalline morphology. Which confirms that PdO uniformly distributed with NiO. Hence, the PdO doping enhances the surface area of the catalyst. In addition, the elemental composition and elemental mapping was analysed for PdO–NiO sample and shown in Fig. 3g,h. The EDX spectra and elemental mapping clearly confirms the presence of the Pd, Ni and O elements in the composite with high purity.

The detailed morphology and particle size distribution of the PdO–NiO NPs was measured by HR-TEM and the results are presented in Fig. 4. Figure 4a–c shows the typical HRTEM images of the as-synthesized PdO–NiO nanocomposite. The obtained TEM images confirmed the uniform distribution of the spherical PdO–NiO NPs, which agrees with FESEM results. In Fig. 4c (inset), the histogram reveals that formed PdO–NiO nanoparticles are uniformly distributed with an average particle size of about 9.64 ± 2.1 nm, which is well associated with XRD crystallite size. Furthermore, the SAED pattern was analyzed to understand the crystallinity and the crystal quality of the PdO–NiO nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 4d. The clear ring-like structure suggests the polycrystalline nature of PdO–NiO. The obtained diffraction rings d-spacing values are corresponding to the (101), (012), (110), (113) and (202) planes of the NiO nanoparticles. Figure 4e shows the lattice fringes of the PdO doped NiO nanoparticles. The fringes show the lattice planes for both metal oxides. The interplanar d-spacing value of 0.1997 nm to correspond to the (012) plane of the NiO phase and the d-spacing value of 0. 2145 nm to correspond to the (110) plane of the PdO in the composite. Which is well correlated with the XRD d-spacing values. Elemental mapping in Fig. 4f shows the presence of Ni, Pd and O elements with uniform distribution as similar as SEM mapping. The morphology results of the synthesized catalysts are well associated with XRD, FTIR and XPS analysis.

UV–Vis absorption spectra were analyzed for the as-synthesized catalysts NiO, PdO and PdO–NiO and the respective results are presented in Fig. 5a. The absorption spectra show the strongest absorption maxima at 234.8 nm for all three catalysts. In addition, the characteristic absorption band of NiO and PdO were observed at 338.2 nm and 422.1 nm respectively23, on the other hand, no characteristic absorption band was observed for PdO–NiO sample. Furthermore, the bandgap energy was calculated for three catalysts by using the Schuster-Kubelka–Munk function.

$$(\alpha {\text{h}}

u )\,{\text{n}} = {\text{A}}({\text{h}}

u - {\text{Eg}})$$ (1)

The bandgap energy (E g ) was achieved by extrapolating against the photon energy and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 5b. The calculated bandgap (E g ) of NiO, PdO and PdO–NiO are 4.05 eV, 3.84 eV and 4.24 eV, respectively25 (Fig. 5b, inset). The PdO doping with NiO increases its bandgap value. This suggests that the PdO interface and NiO interface are closely combined in the composite. The obtained band gap value of the catalysts is much higher than the reported bandgap energy. The bandgap energy is highly dependent on the particle's size. The bandgap energy increases with decreasing particle size, which confirmed that the synthesized catalysts are in nanoscale. The bandgap energy (Eg) of the PdO–NiO catalyst is well associated with FESEM and TEM results.

The photoluminescence (Pl) spectra of NiO, PdO and PdO–NiO materials were measured at 325 nm excitation wavelength and presented in Fig. 6. Figure 6a shows the Pl spectra of the pure NiO, PdO and PdO–NiO nanocomposite. The blue/violet emission was observed for all three samples at 364 nm due to the excitation of 3d8 electrons of Ni2+ ions from the conduction band to the valence band24. From Fig. 6a, it can be seen that the intensity of the PdO–NiO nanocomposite is lower than the pure NiO and PdO, which indicated the higher electron transfer between the NiO and PdO, which is well correlated with electrochemical results. The deconvoluted PL spectra of NiO, PdO and PdO–NiO materials are shown in Fig. 6b–d; four peaks have been fitted for each sample as shown in Fig. 6b–d. The UV emission at 364 nm (3.4 eV) corresponds to the near band edge (NBE) excitation of NiO25. The obtained PL spectra confirmed that the PdO–NiO nanocomposite has more conductivity than the pure metal oxides.

The electrode kinetics of the NiO, PdO and PdO–NiO modified GC electrode was explored in 1 M KOH at different scan rate variation at room temperature. In addition, the resistance of the aforesaid electrodes was monitored in impedance analysis and shown in Fig. 7. Figure 7a, the NiO/GC show a pair of well-defined redox peaks at around 0.49 V and 0.44 V respectively, which corresponding to the reversible reaction between Ni2+ and Ni3+26. In addition, the redox peak currents linearly increase with increasing scan rate.

Figure 7b shows CV pattern of PdO/GC electrode in 1 M KOH solution, which sows poor peaks palladium oxide and palladium reduction peak at 0.52 V and 0.53 V respectively due to the formation of oxyhydroxide on the electrode surface in basic medium. Whereas the PdO–NiO NPs modified GC electrode in Fig. 7c show well-defined Ni2+ and Ni3+ kinetics with eightfold higher peak current. Which confirms the Efficient electron transfer between NiO and PdO in the composite. Which is well associated with PL results. Furthermore, the impedance spectra were achieved for three electrodes at fixed over potential (500 mV s−1) in 1 M KOH electrolyte and presented in Fig. 7d. In Fig. 7d the Rct value of the pure metal oxides NiO/GC and PdO/GC electrode were obtained as 236 Ω and 2702 Ω respectively. Whereas the bimetal oxide PdO–NiO/GC show 425.7 Ω, which is lower than the pure PdO. Due to the superior electron transformation between each metal oxide.

Catalytic reduction of Azo compounds

Azo compounds are highly toxic to the environment as well as human beings. Especially, nitrophenols are listed as the topmost hazardous chemical in the world. Hence the reduction of nitrophenols gains the most attention. Generally, the nitrophenol reduction reaction is thermodynamically favourable (E0 = − 0.76 V) at optimized conditions, whereas the NaBH 4 acts as a reducing agent (E0 = − 1.33 V)27,28. However, the reduction rate is prolonged without the catalyst due to the kinetic barrier between the reducing agent and reactant. Hence, the catalytic reduction nitrophenols are a good way to convert to non-toxic aminophenol (AP) with the presence of NaBH 4 as a reducing agent. The reduction reaction was easily monitored with a UV–Vis spectrometer. It is known that NaBH 4 alone cannot reduce the nitrophenols into aminophenol’s. As shown in Fig. SI. 2 the fresh nitrophenols (NP, DNP and TNP) absorption peak appeared at 300–370 nm respectively. When the addition of reducing agent, the peak was shifted to 402–450 nm28. In addition, the solution color was turned light yellow to deep yellow, due to the formation of corresponding nitrophenolate ions in basic solution. However, no reduction was achieved over 2 h, indicating that nitrophenolate ions were very stable with NaBH 4 . Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the NiO was explored with three nitrophenols and shown in Fig. SI. 3. The pure NiO exhibits a poor catalytic reduction of nitro compounds. In contrast, the PdO–NiO catalyst show excellent activity on the nitrophenols, as shown in Fig. 8.

Figure 8 Catalytic activity and kinetic rate of PdO–NiO nanocomposite on reduction of nitrophenols with NaBH 4 solution (a,b) NP, (c,d) DNP and (e,f) TNP. Full size image

It can be seen that the nitrophenolate peak absorbance at 400 nm gradually decreases with reaction time, which confirmed that PdO–NiO promotes the electron and hydrogen transfer between the reactant. Due to the higher active sites of the PdO–NiO. The present PdO–NiO catalyst completes the reduction reaction of NP, DNP and TNP within 10, 13, 25 min respectively. In addition, the aminophenol absorption peak appeared around 300 nm for all three nitrophenols. On the other hand, the deep yellow solution turned colorless, indicating the formation of aminophenol. The rate constant κ app for each nitrophenol was calculated from the plot of ln (A t /A o ) Vs. time. The proposed PdO–NiO catalyst exhibits excellent rate constant 0.1667, 0.0997, 0.0686 min−1 for NP, DNP and TNT, respectively, which is the higher rate constant than the previously reported catalyst (Table SI. 2). Generally, the reduction mechanism of nitrophenols to aminophenols follows many intermediate steps from nitro to nitroso and then to hydroxylamine and to final aminophenol. For these reaction required both electron transfer and active hydrogen atoms. Here, the BH 4 − ions produce the active hydrogen atoms on the surface of the catalyst and subsequently, the PdO–NiO catalyst enhances the electron transfer. As a result, the reduction of NP could be efficiently accelerated by the PdO–NiO catalyst. Furthermore, comparison of the catalytic reduction performance of nitrophenols with varies catalyst are shown in Table SI. 2. The reduction mechanism of the nitrophenols with PdO–NiO catalyst with NaBH 4 as shown in Fig. SI. 6.

Furthermore, the catalytic activity of PdO–NiO composite was explored by the reduction of organic azo dye compounds such as Methylene blue (MB), Rhodamine B (RhB) and Methyl orange (MO) with the addition of NaBH 4 in the presence of PdO–NiO catalyst29. The reduction of each dye was monitored at different absorption peaks, as shown in Fig. 9. The intensity of each dye at respective wavelengths linearly reduced with time in the presence of the PdO–NiO. In addition, the reduction rate κapp for each dye was calculated from the plot of ln (A t /A o ) Vs. time. PdO–NiO catalyst exhibited excellent reduction rate as 0.099, 0.0416 and 0.0896 min−1 for MB, RhB and MO, respectively, superior catalytic activity than previous reports. In addition, the azo dye solution turned into colourless, indicating the complete reduction occurs in the presence of PdO–NiO. The pure NiO catalyst exhibits poor reduction activity towards azo dyes with the presence of NaBH 4 (Fig. SI. 4). Furthermore, comparison of the catalytic reduction performance azo dyes with varies catalyst are shown in Table. SI. 3. Additionally, the reduction of the mixture of nitrophenols (NP, DNP and TNP) and azo dyes (MB, RhB and MO) was tested with PdO–NiO nanocomposite and obtained results are shown in Fig. 10. Initially, the mixture of azo compounds is formed dark solution then rapidly turned into a colourless and became a transparent solution with the addition of PdO–NiO in the presence of NaBH 4 30. The complete azo compounds reduction was achieved within 8 min. Hence, the proposed PdO–NiO is a promising catalyst for wastewater treatment. In addition, the effect of the catalyst loading on the reduction of mixture of azo compounds were studied with different loading amount of PdO–NiO catalyst (3–10 mg) and shown in the Table. SI. 4. Which show that the reduction rate increased with loading amount of the catalyst. In addition, the catalytic reduction performance of toxic azo compounds by various catalysts are shown in Table. 2. PdO–NiO catalyst exhibit superior reduction performance than the previously reported catalyst.

Furthermore, the reduction mechanism of azo dyes over PdO–NiO catalyst with reducing agent shown in Fig. SI. 7.

After the complete reduction reaction, the catalyst property was analyzed to understand the stability of PdO–NiO. In Fig. 11a, FTIR spectra showed no noticeable changes before and after catalytic reduction of mixture reduction. Additionally, the SEM image (Fig. 11b) also showed no changes in the morphology of the PdO–NiO. In addition, HR-TEM image (Fig. 11c) was also analyzed to study the change in the particles size after catalytic reduction, show no considerable change in the particle size. Which proved that PdO–NiO is highly stable in the reduction conditions.",,[],"['Ramu', 'A.

Achieving More with Priming and Coating,"Commentary & Analysis

If priming and coating are each important to the success of inkjet in commercial printing, both are crucial for inkjet printing in the label and packaging segments. In this article, sponsored by Michelman, Inc., and based on a just-released white paper, European section editor Ralf Schlözer explains how folding carton and corrugated packaging markets are expanding for inkjet in large part due to the application of these fluids.

The most quickly-evolving printing technology coming to the production printing market is inkjet and growth rates in recent years have been dramatic. Inkjet addresses some of the core needs of today’s businesses: smaller runs or batches, just-in-time production, customization, and streamlining of processes.

Inkjet presses have been launched for many applications so far and more are expected. Press manufacturers take great care to design printers that can produce excellent prints. Unfortunately, only press components like inkjet heads, inks, and drying can be well-defined by the press manufacturer. The production and selection of the printing substrate are not. Substrates may be specified by the printing company or the print buyer. They keep changing, either voluntarily or involuntarily, due to paper shortages or batch-to-batch variations from the mill. In any case, a given substrate might not be very receptive to inkjet inks.

A primer can help to overcome receptivity and inconsistency problems by preparing the substrate surface. For porous substrates, a primer keeps the ink, specifically the colorants, on the surface while the carrier fluid soaks into the bulk of the substrate. This is achieved by chemically binding the pigments to the chemicals in the primer layer. On non-porous substrates, the primer creates a surface that holds the colorants in place before the solvent can spread or coalesce.

While a primer can be a necessity for good print quality, an overprint varnish can either embellish a product, by giving it a distinct gloss level, or protect the surface. A varnish can be formulated to be sturdier than an inkjet image, as it does not have the restrictions of being able to hold colorants or to pass through ultra-fine nozzles. It can protect the print from damage in finishing, transport or from sunlight.

In commercial print, the advantages of priming and coating for inkjet printers are already well documented, but probably still not well-known enough. A primer is used to keep the colorants at the surface to achieve good color strength and reduce the amount of ink. Compatibility with standard offset coated paper is especially critical and does not generally receive inkjet ink well without being treated.

If priming and coating are each important in commercial printing, both are crucial for quality inkjet printing in labels and packaging segments. While in commercial printing, the paper is usually selected based on appearance and price, substrates in packaging print have another function to fulfil: to safely hold and transport products. Finishing, assembly, and transport can be quite detrimental to durability of the print image. The required surfaces for the various packaging segments may be challenging to print on as well.

Folding carton is a prime example of a packaging application where every container needs to look alike and pristine on the shelf. Product manufacturers want the same image, brand colors, and level of gloss on their packaging, however it is produced. Matched priming and coating are key ingredients in achieving consistency. As substrates are optimized for usage as a sealed packaging material, they are made more difficult to print on in general.

This is particularly true of substrates for corrugated boxes and displays. Surfaces for corrugated materials are usually very absorbent and would require large amounts of ink to achieve a decent color strength, while low-grade fibers or recycled materials cause unevenness. The use of optimized primers for the multiple substrates used has made the corrugated box market one of the latest, and biggest success stories in inkjet adoption.

In label printing, inkjet is already well established. As inkjet is increasingly moving from secondary to primary labels, requirements in quality and durability increase. A primer can improve both, especially when moving to aqueous inkjet. Even UV inks benefit when the primer stops the ink from soaking into the bulk of the substrate, thus preventing curing problems and unwanted odor from uncured ink.

Inkjet press providers for flexible packaging already made the move to aqueous inks, due to the many food products in flexible packaging. However, without a primer making inkjet inks adhere well to flexible packaging material, this would be very challenging.

Customers, design, and distribution requirements are getting more demanding. Priming and coating make fulfilling the application requirements in many print segments much easier. However, it is by no means an easy task to design a good primer or coating. A good primer or coating should not be judged by the price of the liter either, but by the print quality achieved, the improved efficiency, the reduced inventory and waste, and the flexibility added to the whole print manufacturing process. Even for cost-sensitive projects, it pays to investigate how a primer or coating can improve results—considering the diverse requirements in the many application areas for print

The full white paper, which encapsulates their insights on the importance and implications of priming and coating can be downloaded from Inkjet Insight here.

Chemistry education must change to help the planet: here’s how,"Classroom chemistry needs to equip pupils and students with the knowledge and skills to design products in a way that minimizes harm.Credit: Kalpak Pathak/Hindustan Times/Getty

Generations of chemists have taken what nature has to offer and converted it into hugely beneficial products — from drugs to dyes and from fertilizers to food packaging. But the current environmental crisis, in terms of both carbon emissions and plastics pollution, is also a creature of chemistry. And that means chemists must re-engineer their working methods as part of efforts to solve it — including rethinking how current and future generations of chemists are educated. This is happening, although nowhere near as quickly as it needs to.

In Nature this week, chemist Bartosz Grzybowski at the Ulsan Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea and his colleagues describe one such effort, which uses artificial intelligence to repurpose waste compounds into useful products. Algorithms trained on thousands of reactions suggested ways to create some 300 known chemicals used in pharmaceuticals and agriculture. They include the antibiotic dapsone and a key intermediate for a muscle relaxant called cisatracurium, a drug that has been used in the treatment of people with COVID-19.

The work is among the latest contributions to green chemistry, a movement that began in the 1990s with efforts to find environmentally friendly ways to carry out chemical reactions, by using greener solvents, say, or less energy-intensive reaction conditions. Since then, there have been advances, such as improvements in plastics recycling and the development of catalysts that can break down otherwise indestructible materials into smaller, more useful molecules. Sustainable chemistry research is expected to get a further boost as talks get under way on a legally binding international treaty aimed at eliminating plastic pollution.

But for research to progress faster, a reset is needed in the classroom, too — in both school and university teaching. Chemistry education needs to change so that students are taught how to design drugs and agrochemicals, such as fertilizers, in ways that are both safe and sustainable.

Some universities are now offering postgraduate courses in environmental, green or sustainable chemistry, and school and undergraduate chemistry courses are increasingly incorporating the chemistry of climate change, and covering chemistry’s health, environmental and social impacts.

But equipping pupils and students with the knowledge and skills to design products in a way that minimizes or eliminates harm is a greater challenge. In many countries, sustainability is not yet treated as a core or underpinning concept in undergraduate and senior-school chemistry. Concerningly, in many nations, school chemistry curricula remain similar to those taught several decades ago.

Researchers who study chemistry in education are advocating that curricula be based on a systems-thinking approach. This would teach students both how to understand the connections between the elements that make up a chemical compound or product, and how to quantify chemistry’s wider impacts — for example, on the economy and society, the environment and human health.

At the same time, some core components of chemistry syllabuses are also ripe for a rethink. Organic chemistry is one example, according to David Constable at the American Chemical Society’s Green Chemistry Institute in Washington DC and his colleagues (D. J. C. Constable J. Chem. Educ. 96, 2689–2699; 2019). Organic chemistry courses are “largely oriented toward the transformations of carbon compounds from fossil sources using chemical reagents and catalysts”, the authors write in a commentary in a special issue of the Journal of Chemical Education devoted to reimagining chemistry education. Many such compounds are difficult to recycle and reuse — or recycling is considered an afterthought. Moreover, the reagents involved can be hazardous. The researchers propose that more students should study the chemistry of compounds produced by living organisms — a topic taught in biochemistry courses — as well as compounds that are easier to recycle. Doing so would help students to design products that are biodegradable, or that can more easily be broken down into their most benign parts, ready to find other uses.

Universities and chemistry’s professional societies recognize what is needed and are helping to effect change. Imperial College London has suspended two long-running master’s courses — in petroleum engineering and petroleum geoscience. The American Chemical Society has an active programme of research and engagement in sustainable chemistry education, with a strong focus on systems thinking. The United Kingdom’s Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) has said that it recognizes that school chemistry is not adequately preparing the next generation for a world dominated by climate change and sustainability, and is recommending changes to schools’ curricula.

Last year, the RSC carried out a survey of chemistry educators and students in the United Kingdom and Ireland that revealed that not all teachers (particularly those teaching pupils aged 16 and over) are confident that they have the subject knowledge to be teaching chemistry in a different way. But the survey also revealed that pupils are keen to know more. The school-aged respondents told the society that they are deeply concerned about climate change and are interested in careers that involve sustainability.

The challenges inherent in introducing difficult concepts are unavoidable. But if students are willing to learn — as the RSC survey suggests — that will make the task more fulfilling, and will ensure that the next generation of chemists has the knowledge and the skills to lead a much-needed revolution.",,[],[]

Graphene Climbs the Walls

Was it a good week for graphene news? It’s always a good week for graphene news! From Graphene-Info:

A social housing development in Wales is reportedly being heated by graphene-enhanced wallpaper by NexGen Heating, as part of a trial exploring affordable alternatives to radiators and heat pumps to keep residents warm.

The “graphene heating system” supposedly looks and feels like traditional wallpaper—except perhaps for the fact that it can be plugged into an electrical socket, which regular wallpaper doesn’t usually require. Oh, and it comes packaged with solar panels and a smart battery—meaning it cuts carbon emissions while at the same time lowering fuel costs. Graphene for the win!

On the other hand, the same Graphene-Info newsletter also included an item about “a graphene oxide-based method of pre-enriching uranium in seawater by membrane filtration.” Uh oh. Sounds like the kind of world-domination plot a Bond villain would try to cook up. Could “Graphenefinger” be the next James Bond movie?

“Mona Lisa, Men Have Caked You…”

Whilst no one has been sure for centuries the source of Lisa del Giocondo’s enigmatic smile, one recent visitor to the Louvre may have interpreted it as a sign of low blood sugar. Says AP:

A man seemingly disguised as an old woman in a wheelchair threw a piece of cake at the glass protecting the Mona Lisa at the Louvre Museum and shouted at people to think of planet Earth.

Hmm…Sounds like Whistler’s Mother (aka Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1). Could she have made the journey from the Musée d'Orsay to attack a fellow painting? Is this a whole weird new area we’re getting into? Well, maybe not:

Security guards were filmed escorting the wig-wearing man away as he called out to the surprised visitors in the gallery: “Think of the Earth! There are people who are destroying the Earth! Think about it. Artists tell you: think of the Earth. That’s why I did this.”

Which only raises more questions than it answers.

Guards were then filmed cleaning the cake from the glass. A Louvre statement confirmed the attack on the artwork involving a “patisserie.”

This is not the first time that La Gioconda has come under physical attack:

The painting was stolen in 1911 by a museum employee, an event which increased the painting’s international fame. It was also damaged in an acid attack perpetrated by a vandal in the 1950s, and has since been kept behind glass. In 2009, a Russian woman who was angry at not being able to get French citizenship threw a ceramic cup at it, smashing the cup but not harming the glass or the painting.

And still…she keeps on smiling.

Games People Play

If you’re looking for a hyper-realistic video game, why not try Bad Writer, a first-person shooter writer game in which you try selling short stories to magazines.

You play Emily, a struggling writer, trying to make it in the big bad world of short story publishing. You walk around your house, getting ideas, and writing stories. Try not to get too distracted, or you will get sad that you hadn't written during the day. Get too sad, and it's game over. She gives up and gets a new job doing something far less fun and stressful.

The creator of the game, Paul Jessup, knows of what he speaks: he is a writer by trade, having sent more than 18 years publishing short stories and novels. Boing Boing adds: “Lavie Tidhar, author of Maror, Hood, By Force Alone, Osama, Central Station, calls Bad Writer ‘the most depressingly realistic writer’s life simulation I ever experienced.’”

Chain of Command

Morningstar has the lowdown on the latest with the “supply chain” disruptions. Where do we currently stand?

“No one really knows,” says Morningstar senior equity analyst Michael Field, who covers shipping and logistics.

Doh! OK, is there any guidance?

Field points to a few bright spots. Labor availability has improved in key areas, such as ports, to help move goods across the world. Companies have been signing long-term contracts with shippers to secure transportation, which was normally a buy-it-as-you-need-it market prior to the pandemic, Field says.

Some of the industries most significantly hit by global supply chain shortages include semiconductors, automobiles, industrials, retail, and restaurants.

Click through for more granular detail.

For all the woes hitting other industries, when it comes to shipping and logistic companies like Maersk (MAERSK B), supply chain issues have been a boon, and led to higher shipping rates.

Awesome. Here is a map of some of the latest trouble spots:

What’s the [Re]Use?

The Atlantic asks a reasonable question: should we bother recycling plastic? The authors point out:

Plastic recycling does not work and will never work. The United States in 2021 had a dismal recycling rate of about 5 percent for post-consumer plastic waste, down from a high of 9.5 percent in 2014, when the U.S. exported millions of tons of plastic waste to China and counted it as recycled—even though much of it wasn’t.

It’s not that we don’t want to recycle it. Look at paper: it has a recycling rate of 68%. The problem with plastic, however, is not the concept, the process, or even the desire, but the nature of the beast.

The first problem is that there are thousands of different plastics, each with its own composition and characteristics. They all include different chemical additives and colorants that cannot be recycled together, making it impossible to sort the trillions of pieces of plastics into separate types for processing.

… Just one fast-food meal can involve many different types of single-use plastic, including PET#1, HDPE#2, LDPE#4, PP#5, and PS#6 cups, lids, clamshells, trays, bags, and cutlery, which cannot be recycled together. This is one of several reasons why plastic fast-food service items cannot be legitimately claimed as recyclable in the U.S.

Couple that with the fact that plastic recycling itself produces waste—and often toxic waste at that—and that it isn’t even remotely economical and the problem becomes almost insoluble. Should we despair? The article points to some obvious but unpopular solutions:

Proven solutions to the U.S.’s plastic-waste and pollution problems exist and can be quickly replicated across the country. These solutions include enacting bans on single-use plastic bags and unrecyclable single-use plastic food-service products, ensuring widespread access to water-refilling stations, installing dishwashing equipment in schools to allow students to eat food on real dishes rather than single-use plastics, and switching Meals on Wheels and other meal-delivery programs from disposables to reusable dishware.

Ultimately it is up to us:

Consumers can put pressure on companies to stop filling store shelves with single-use plastics by not buying them and instead choosing reusables and products in better packaging. And we should all keep recycling our paper, boxes, cans, and glass, because that actually works.

The article doesn’t mention it but we hasten to add here programs like Vycom’s Recycling Program for display graphics and Lintec’s new film made from plastic water bottles. So obviously one goal is to find ways to safely and effectively reuse the plastic we’ve got, but the ultimate goal would be to produce less of the stuff to begin with.

Dyson’s Rosie Future

If you grew up watching The Jetsons, you immediately associate the name Rosie with the android maid. (If you are an AC/DC fan, the name means something else. If you’re a fan of both, it’s just really confusing.) Anyway, the idea of a robotic housekeeper is creeping closer to reality, and Dyson is one of the companies leading the way. Says The Verge:

Dyson has shown off a series of prototype robots it’s developing, and announced plans to hire hundreds of engineers over the next five years in order to build robots capable of household chores. The images are designed to show off the fine motor skills of the machines, with arms capable of lifting plates out of a drying rack, vacuuming a sofa, or lifting up a children’s toy.

The company, best known for its range of vacuum cleaners, says that it aims to develop “an autonomous device capable of household chores and other tasks,” with The Guardian noting that such a device could be released by 2030. It comes over half a decade after the company released its first robotic device, the Dyson 360 Eye robot vacuum cleaner, in 2014. Dyson has long emphasized its interest in AI and robotics to underpin its future products.

And they’re hiring like mad, currently recruiting 250 robotics engineers and plans to hire 700 more in the next five years. Dyson says they’ve already hired 2,000 new employees this year. They are also building a massive robotics lab in the UK. “The center will be based at Hullavington Airfield near the company’s existing design center in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, where it’s refitting an aircraft hanger where 250 roboticists will work.”

No word on how they’re coming with the other Rosie.

I, Roommate

While Dyson is working on robots to help around the house, New York State has launched a robot-based program to help conquer the problem of social isolation, especially among the elderly. Developed by the New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), the program will distribute robot companions to the homes of more than 800 older adults. Unlike what Dyson is working on, these ’bots, called ElliQ and built by Israel’s Intuition Robotics, are says The Verge, “more proactive versions of digital assistants like Siri or Alexa—engaging users in small talk, helping contact love ones, and keeping track of health goals like exercise and medication.”

ElliQ consists of two parts attached to a single base. The first part is a lamp-like “face” with microphone and speakers, that lights up and swivels to face people it’s talking to. The second is a touchscreen tablet, used to display pictures, additional information, and conduct video calls. The unit has been deliberately design to appear more robotic than humanoid, in order to better focus attention on its conversational abilities.

Intuition Robotics’ claim is that ElliQ can project empathy and form bonds with users. The robot is supposed to remember key details about a user’s life, and shape its character to their own. It will crack more jokes if the user tends to laugh a lot, for example.

No word on whether it has what would be the most useful function: an emergency calling feature in the event of an accident, or if the robot’s roommate were suddenly unresponsive (which, admittedly, isn’t always an emergency situation…).

Robot companions for the elderly is not uncontroversial, but it really depends on the person. We know several of our forebears who would throw the thing against the wall within five minutes.

Death Hamster

Coming soon to SyFy: Vicious Mutant Attack Hamster…ripped, as they say, from the headlines, the headline in question being the scientific journal Neuroscience. In Act I, a group of researchers attempt to bioengineer a super-friendly, not even remotely aggressive hamster. They avail themselves of CRISPR gene editing technology to

more fully examine the role of Avpr1a in the expression of social behaviors. We confirmed the absence of Avpr1as in these hamsters by demonstrating 1) a complete lack of Avpr1a-specific receptor binding throughout the brain, 2) a behavioral insensitivity to centrally administered AVP, and 3) an absence of the well-known blood-pressure response produced by activating Avpr1as.

Avpr1as refers to Arginine–vasopressin (AVP) acting on V1a receptors, which “represents a key signaling mechanism in a brain circuit that increases the expression of social communication and aggression.” Basically, it’s a hormone that’s supposed to regulate things like teamwork, bonding, and general friendliness. The idea was that, by chopping out this hormone, the hamsters would stop all such regulation and just be cute and cuddly all the time.

What, as they say, could possibly go wrong. You know you’re in for trouble when the study’s abstract includes the word “unexpectedly.”

Unexpectedly, however, Avpr1a KO hamsters displayed more social communication behavior and aggression toward same-sex conspecifics than did their wild-type (WT) littermates.

And thus, by Act II, the supposedly docile hamsters were in fact vicious attack hamsters. It’s not a far stretch (for SyFy) to expect the hamsters to further self-mutate and start to turn on and kill the researchers themselves, then finally escape the lab and terrorize the country.

Hmm…sounds kind of like The Killer Shrews.

Font of Emotion

We all know that typefaces can affect our emotions. But how and why? To understand the relationship between typography and our emotions (well, your emotions, puny human), Monotype recently partnered with applied neuroscience company Neurons to develop a study entitled, “Why fonts make us feel; A scientific study exploring the emotional impact of type.” Says Print magazine:

The study consisted of online research conducted in November 2021 of over 400 participants in the UK, ranging from ages 18 to 50 with an even gender split. Neurons used data collection and consumer neuroscience to measure people’s subconscious and conscious reactions to type with three distinct typefaces: FS Jack (a humanist sans), Gilroy (a geometric sans), and Cotford (a languid serif).

Languid serif? Anyway:

The researchers used these typefaces in three separate written scenarios: single words, a sentence using those words, and a sentence using those words with a brand included. Study participants were then asked to rate their emotional responses to these stimuli, including how sincere, memorable, trustworthy, or confident they felt.

Happily, there is no use of the word “unexpectedly” and no mention of vicious mutant attack fonts (that would be Comic Sans), but the study did confirm their hypothesis that type can have a significant effect on emotions.

You can take a deeper dive into this research on the Monotype website or watch a webinar about it.

Now Ear This

Scientists have, for the first time, 3D-printed a body part using an individual’s own cells. It is a field called tissue engineering (no, that is not a department at Kimberly-Clark), and a Queens, N.Y.-based biotech company called 3DBio Therapeutics used a 3D printer to create a replacement ear for a 20-year-old woman who had been born with a tiny, misshapen one. Says the NY Times:

The new ear was printed in a shape that precisely matched the woman’s left ear, according to 3DBio Therapeutics, a regenerative medicine company based in Queens. The new ear, transplanted in March, will continue to regenerate cartilage tissue, giving it the look and feel of a natural ear, the company said.

… The results of the woman’s reconstructive surgery were announced by 3DBio in a news release. Citing proprietary concerns, the company has not publicly disclosed the technical details of the process, making it more difficult for outside experts to evaluate. The company said that federal regulators had reviewed the trial design and set strict manufacturing standards, and that the data would be published in a medical journal when the study was complete.

This is the latest in an ongoing series of tests seeking to use 3D printing in tissue and organ replacement and repair.

United Therapeutics Corp….is also experimenting with 3-D printing to produce lungs for transplants, a spokesman said. And scientists from the Israel Institute of Technology reported in September that they had printed a network of blood vessels, which would be necessary to supply blood to implanted tissues.

… With more research, company executives said, the technology could be used to make many other replacement body parts, including spinal discs, noses, knee menisci, rotator cuffs and reconstructive tissue for lumpectomies. Further down the road, they said, 3-D printing could even produce far more complex vital organs, like livers, kidneys and pancreases.

Water, Water Everywhere

You know how it is. You agree to be the bagman for a drug lord, but something goes horribly wrong and you have no choice but to walk hundreds of miles across the desert with very little water. (Oh, wait, that was an episode of Better Call Saul.)

Anyway, Jimmy McGill would have been completely set if he had a new gel developed by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin that can extract liters of water per day out of even very dry air. The trick is the material of which the gel is made (sorry, Cary, it’s not graphene). From New Atlas:

The gel is made up of two main ingredients that are cheap and common – cellulose, which comes from the cell walls of plants, and konjac gum, a widely used food additive. Those two components work together to make a gel film that can absorb water from the air and then release it on demand, without requiring much energy.

First, the porous structure of the gum attracts water to condense out of the air around it. The cellulose, meanwhile, is designed to respond to a gentle heat by turning hydrophobic, releasing the captured water.

How much water could the gel extract?

In tests, the gel film was able to wring an astonishing amount of water out of the air. At a relative humidity of 30 percent, it could produce 13 L (3.4 gal) of water per day per kilogram of gel, and even when the humidity dropped to just 15 percent – which is low, even for desert air – it could still produce more than 6 L (1.6 gal) a day per kilogram.

While this would be useful for adventurers (or bagmen), the real need would be in places where water scarcity has become an issue—which are only going to increase as climate change continues.

The research on this gel was published in the journal Nature Communications.

Buzzfish

This one’s going to sting. We’re not sure we understand this, but here it goes: in California, bees are now legally considered to be fish. And we’re not talking about Bumble Bee tuna. Here is a portion of the ruling, via Boing Boing(emphasis added):

The California Endangered Species Act (Act) (Fish & G. Code,1 § 2050 et seq.) directs the Fish and Game Commission (Commission) to ""establish a list of endangered species and a list of threatened species."" (§ 2070.) The issue presented here is whether the bumble bee, a terrestrial invertebrate, falls within the definition of fish, as that term is used in the definitions of endangered species in section 2062, threatened species in section 2067, and candidate species (i.e., species being considered for listing as endangered or threatened species) in section 2068 of the Act. More specifically, we must determine whether the Commission exceeded its statutorily delegated authority when it designated four bumble bee species as candidate species under consideration for listing as endangered species.

Here’s the crux of the biscuit, from the Law & Crime blog: “a three-judge panel of a state appellate court found that certain invertebrate animal species, including bees, are legally contained under the same umbrella definition as “fish” under the terms of the Golden State’s homegrown Endangered Species Act.”

Essentially, several types of bees were under danger from large agricultural interests, and the California Fish and Game Commission sought to protect them by including them in the aegis of the CSEA. Big Ag sued, claiming that the CESA does not allow insects to be designated as endangered, threatened, or candidate species, as they are not specifically mentioned in the statute’s categories of wildlife.

The Commission countered, saying that the definition of fish can and should encapsulate bees and other similarly situated invertebrates because, in part, it already does in practice. At least one species of shrimp, snail and crayfish are listed under the CESA. The listing of the Trinity bristle snail is particularly instructive, the Commission argued.

All right, take it to the hole:

That’s because the snail, the commissioners note, does not even live in the water and was categorized as “threatened” in 1980. The way the snail got on the list was by being classified as a “fish.” Since the bristle snail is a terrestrial species, the Commission argues, “fish” cannot be limited to animals that inhabit a marine environment.

It does involve some wordplay.

“We generally give words their usual and ordinary meaning,” the analysis begins. “Where, however, the Legislature has provided a technical definition of a word, we construe the term of art in accordance with the technical meaning. In performing this function, we are tasked with liberally construing the Act to effectuate its remedial purpose.”

To snail it home:

Under a liberal construction of the CESA, the court concluded that the word “fish” is a legal term of art that previously included a “terrestrial mollusk” under section 2607.

“Accordingly, a terrestrial invertebrate, like each of the four bumble bee species, may be listed as an endangered or threatened species under the Act,” the unanimous 35-page opinion holds.

Although it doesn’t seem to have come up in any of this, the famed evolutionary biologist and paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould once famously remarked that, after a lifetime studying fish, he concluded that there was “no such thing as a fish.” For example, although there are many sea creatures, most of them are not closely related to each other—one example being that a salmon is more closely related to a camel than it is to a hagfish.

Stephen Fry explains it a lot better than us:

Perhaps the real question is whether Catholics can eat bees on Friday during Lent.

Observing Organic Dye Chemical Clock Reactions,"In a review recently published in the journal Dyes and Pigments, researchers presented the progress, applications, and perspectives of chemical clock reactions with organic dyes.

Study: Chemical clock reactions with organic dyes: Perspective, progress, and applications. Image Credit: Team Oktopus/Shutterstock.com

Background

The clock reactions are significantly similar to classical oscillating reactions, but their exact behavior, nature, and mechanism are dependent on the reaction conditions and substrate. Despite the fact that the blue bottle experiment (classic clock reaction) is a well-known demonstration and practical activity, its origin is unknown. Organic molecules are used as starting ingredients for synthetic organic colors. Most natural dyes were made from plant sources until synthetic dyes were discovered.

Dyes' redox activity is influenced by the reaction circumstances and catalyst utilized. The oxidized form of most organic dyes is colored, while the reduced form is colorless. The early evolution of the clock and oscillation reactions have been the subject of certain review studies. Whether the chemical clock and oscillating reactions can be used in analytical chemistry with organic dyes is still not known.

About the Study

In this study, the authors presented a comprehensive review of the clock reaction with organic dyes. The qualities of the dye, such as water solubility, were taken into consideration when selecting it. In the oxidation and reduction states of dyes, the varied and unique color variations of the dyes were studied. A wide range of pH was employed to adjust dye redox activity and the rate of the clock reaction.

Using standard tools like ultraviolet (UV)-visible (vis) spectroscopy, the visual detection of oxidation-reduction was monitored. A brief feasible mechanism for synthesizing catalytic systems was explored as well as its impact on clock reactions was illustrated. The differences between adsorption and degradation clock reactions were also discussed. The importance of clock reactions in numerous fields was demonstrated.

The team investigated several properties of the dyes such as variation in color, research of dye interaction with reaction media and catalyst, rate determination of clock reactions with dye changes, and redox behavior of different dyes in various catalytic systems. Water-soluble organic dyes were used as a redox indicator, with the formal oxidation and reduction potential values changing due to the dyes' redox behavior and the nature of catalysts. To determine the redox kinetics in ordered media or a free solution, such as reverse micelles and micelles, catalytic changes were made to influence the rate of the clock reaction. The nanocatalysts were used to expand the clock reaction's use and application range.

The researchers discussed the color chemistry of the organic dyes in the presence of different nanocatalysts, as well as modifications in reaction conditions to optimize clock activity. The development of new methods for identifying and quantifying analytes in actual samples by measuring the sequential oscillations of a colored reactant was presented to broaden the analytical applications available. The organic dye-based clock reactions were examined in a methodical manner. The focus was on various methodologies and their applications in clock activities. The use of redox activity in organic dyes in the presence of manufactured nanocatalysts was also highlighted.

Observations

Due to coordination interactions between Cu 2 O and Cr3+, the addition of Cr3+ in the concentration range from 0.03 to 600 M lowered the catalytic activity of Cu 2 O nanocubes, which resulted in an increase in reaction time. Cr3+ adsorption on the Cu 2 O surface reduced their standard reduction potential, which prevented Cu 2 O from being reduced to Cu (0). The CeO 2 -x/dye/H 2 O solution and CeO 2 -x/dye/hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC)-coated fabrics both displayed rapid decoloration after being exposed to blue light of wavelength 450 nm for 30 and 150 seconds, respectively.

The water-soluble oxidized form of methylene blue (MB), MB+ (blue color), had absorbance maxima of 291 and 664 nm, while the reduced form, leucomethylene blue (LMB), had a maximum absorbance of 256 nm. At 644 nm, there was a progressive drop in peak intensity and a rise in a newly formed peak at 256 nm. The interaction of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with the g-C 3 N 4 support promoted the adsorption and subsequent dissociation of molecular hydrogen and oxygen, which resulted in effective reversible conversion between MB and LMB with a turnover frequency of 165 h-1. TiO 2 's bandgap of value 3.2 eV was found to be acceptable for using a UV light for photo-reversible color switching (PCS) activities.

In the presence of 2 g Cu nanowires (NWs), a 99% decrease in the catalytic activity of the CuNWs was achieved in less than 5 seconds. In the presence of Cu 2 O, the activation energy decreased by 16.3 kcal/mol, which made the reduction process of MB to LMB 2.4107 times quicker.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this review elucidated the developments and accomplishments of organic dye-based clock reactions that can be used as an analytical tool. The progression and mechanism of clock activity with different dyes were documented chronologically with different catalytic systems.

The authors emphasized that the catalyst used must be able to participate in the electron transfer reaction quickly. They believe that this study will aid in the comprehension of the mechanism of organic dye oxidation-reduction from redox media to the nanocatalysis system. They also mentioned that the reader would be able to understand and build novel redox catalysts for a different dye type of clock reaction by looking at the differences in clock reactions with dye adsorption and degradation.

There’s nothing dull about the world of natural dyes,"Smashed on sourdough and sprinkled with feta, the avocado has become a millennial symbol of clean living and, some may say, frivolous overspending. But for Brooklyn-based Venezuelan artist María-Elena Pombo, the superfood’s popularity – domestic consumption having soared sixfold from 436m pounds to over 2.6bn pounds between 1985 and 2020 in the US – presents an aesthetic opportunity. “An often overlooked property of the avocado is its dyeing capability,” she says, “which is highly dependable, due to the tannins it contains.” If you boil the stones, they will produce a pretty, pale – and fittingly millennial – pink.

Pombo has been running workshops under the name of Fragmentario on how to extract colour from avocado seeds since 2016. Her Avocado Tour has taken her from Tokyo and Osaka to Berlin and Barcelona, pausing at London’s Somerset House in June where her exhibition La Rentrada explored how the Venezuelan economy, a country heavily reliant on oil exports, could take advantage of avocado seeds to create alternatives to fuels and materials. And it’s not just avocados that have featured in the artist’s explorations of natural dyes – she’s worked with a variety of plants for workshops and client commissions.

Pombo is channelling an age-old practice. Plant-based dyes were used up until the mid-19th century when synthetic alternatives were developed. Indigo and saffron were used in India, for example, and the madder root was cultivated in Europe to dye military uniforms red. Today, as the textile industry’s use of chemical-heavy dyes comes under scrutiny, these methods of applying colour are being explored afresh.

Dublin-based Kathryn Davey started experimenting with indigo dye while making dolls for her three children. She now dyes her own range of products – from wool socks to linen napkins and tablecloths – and collaborates with like-minded brands such as the organic underwear label Pico and childrenswear line Apolina. “I’ve also been teaching natural-dye workshops for the past couple of years and they’re always sold out,” she says. “For me, there’s the environmental aspect of it, but there is also definitely something nourishing and soothing about the colours. I work a lot with cutch [catechu], which comes from the heartwood of the acacia tree and creates really beautiful shades – a whole spectrum of earthy tones.”

Our processes are natural. We don’t use anything you couldn’t drink

Those exploring the medium do so in many ways, from the painterly to the scientific. Textile designer Ellen Mae Williams reinterprets the Oxfordshire landscape in vibrant abstract spatters and brush marks, using food waste from onions and avocados, as well as plant dyes such as chlorophyll (green), madder (pink) and logwood (purple) to create linen tablecloths, napkins and cushions. In the Hague, Nienke Hoogvliet has set up a design studio that explores natural-dye alternatives to mainstream textile practices. Her projects have involved using herbs to dye and infuse a handstitched linen quilt, creating yarns and dyes from different types of seaweed, and using materials created in wastewater processes. She found that Kaumera, a bio-based byproduct of some water-purification plants in the Netherlands, “makes textiles absorb dyes better, so less water is needed and less is polluted”. She also discovered that two natural dyes – Anammox and Vivianite – could be extracted from wastewater, showcasing her findings as a kimono at Oxfordshire gallery Informality earlier this year.

In Los Angeles, Max Kingery’s approach to natural dyes is also driven by research. “We’re not just making pretty colours,” says the co-founder of fashion label Olderbrother. Each season he experiments with different dye materials and processes, showcasing his clothing alongside immersive shop-scapes at his Venice Beach base. When in 2018 he presented a collection dyed with chaga mushrooms foraged in the Adirondacks, the space became a living fungi terrarium. For AW21 he has focused on fermentation – everything sewn and dyed in California. “We develop all of our processes, our recipes in-house and just experiment, experiment, experiment,” he says.

One of the main criticisms of natural dyes is that they often use chemical mordants to “fix” the colour to the fabric, and while Kingery keeps his formulas close to his chest, he lists plant tannins, oak galls, alum (potassium aluminium sulphate) and iron oxide among Olderbrother’s mordant repertoire. “Our processes are 99.9 per cent natural,” he says. “We don’t use anything that you couldn’t drink.” Another criticism is that natural dyes are much less long-lasting than their synthetic counterparts, but for Kingery this only adds to the appeal. “There is a bit of wabi-sabi to our stuff,” he says.

Other brands are coming round to a similar eco-first way of thinking. When Barcelona-based vegan sneaker brand Saye launched its first clothing collection last year, it opted for all-natural dyes “not to get the perfect colour but to use an eco-friendly solution”, says co-founder Marta Llaquet. In interiors, Ochre has launched Ochre Wild, a collection of handcrafted rugs in hemp, ramie, linen and silk that are coloured with turmeric, marigold, indigo and madder root; Caravane has created a series of table mats and rugs with plant-dyed reeds woven into ikat patterns; Noble Souls uses special dyes that are 100 per cent natural for its upholstery; while Charlotte Lawson Johnston has founded Cloth Collective as a British group of growers, spinners, weavers and dyers, including Katherine Preston, the former head of studio at Fermoie fabrics. Using 100 per cent compostable fabrics and dyes from bio and botanical waste, Cloth Collective’s aim is to scale up this “cottage” industry to create climate-positive interior fabrics, and collaborate with brands such as shoemaker Le Monde Beryl, for whom they developed two plant-dyed natural linens for its SS22 collection.

San Francisco loungewear label Harvest & Mill takes a similar home-grown approach to its WFH-friendly organic cotton range, which incorporates limited-edition T-shirts naturally dyed with California clay by Oakland-based artist Rosa Novak, as well as several entirely un-dyed options, their natural hues created by using heirloom varieties of cotton that grow in subtle brown or green. Its approach is holistic. “Sustainable design has to take into account the origins of the materials, who sewed a garment, does a dye factory pollute local air or water and so on,” says founder Natalie Patricia. “Sustainability is about systems and communities.”

Caravane rush Mahila carpet, €270

Apprvl Sienna Cloud bag, $112.70

In larger-scale production, calculating the environmental impact of dyeing must also take into account the amount of water and heat used. Llaquet sums up the advantages of natural dyes: “They do not contaminate water, they produce low CO2 emissions thanks to cold dyeing, they save up to 40 per cent in water consumption, and they produce harmless waste and recycling water for future dyes.” Porto-based textile company Tintex, which has been crafting jersey fabrics for over 20 years for the likes of Portuguese designer Maria Gambina, states that its patented plant-dyed Colorau fabric uses up to 60 per cent less water than conventionally dyed textiles.

Could natural dyes become the norm across the textile industry? “The challenge is to get diversity of colours,” says Tintex CEO Ricardo Silva. “Today, we have light yellows with thyme and several browns with other ingredients like chestnut. Greens are on the way. Due to the colour-range expectations of the market, I believe a hybrid production with herb-based and synthetic dyestuffs will be the scenario, at least for the next few years. In parallel, some long-term investigations using biotechnology – with bacteria, for example – could offer alternatives to the synthetic dye stuffs currently used. At that time, we might envision a fully bio-based textile dyeing process – that’s a very real possibility. Stay tuned…”",,[],['Victoria Woodcock']

Aluminum Tubes Led to Success at Summer Fridays

Wood-Based Tubes Support ‘Field-to-Face’ Beauty at Bloomeffects

The birth of tubes as easily squeezable and collapsible packages for dispensing products from paint to glue to cosmetics—and perhaps most notably, toothpaste—was recorded in 1841, when American artist John Goffe Rand invented a pliable metal tube to effectively hold paint. (HistoryofCosmetics.net; Wikipedia)Almost a half-century later, in 1889, Johnson & Johnson was the first major company to package toothpaste in a tube, when they introduced their first consumer product, Zonweiss, in a collapsible metal tube. Soon after, a Connecticut dentist started selling toothpaste in lead tubes in the 1890s.A metal shortage caused by World War II put an end to tubes made of tin and lead, and packaging producers moved to aluminum and plastic. Most toothpaste tubes have been made from sheets of plastic laminate, which is usually a combination of various plastics surrounding a thin layer of aluminum that works to protect the taste and formula of the product inside.Now, in this age of packaging sustainability consciousness and mandates , the mixed material composition of toothpaste tubes makes them difficult to recycle, and cosmetic industry suppliers and brands are again in the midst of finding new solutions.Tubes are increasingly available in an array of materials from plastics to aluminum to paper to sugarcane bioplastics; in sizes from minis to economy; shapes from round to oval (and beyond—read on); and topped with an array of cap styles.With their many benefits, including hygienic protection, ease of use, cost-effectiveness and decorative options, tubes have become the preferred packaging not only for many oral care products, but also for cosmetic items from eye shadow to lip balm to hair treatments.At the end of 2021, research from Future Market Insights (FMI) showed that the global cosmetic tubes market was expected to reach a valuation of $2.4 billion for the year. With rising demand for their use in makeup and skincare products, FMI predicted that the overall sales of cosmetic tubes would increase at 4.6% CAGR between 2021 and 2031.Cosmetic tubes offer various advantages over conventional packaging solutions, say FMI analysts. They are versatile, easy to use, lightweight, preserve moisture, and provide effective protection against contamination from various environmental factors. Most plastic tubes are considered safe as they do not interact with the contents within the tube. R&D success has also led to improved flexibility, decorative techniques and labeling—and new and advanced versions of materials from aluminum to paper.Manufacturers are now focusing on developing cosmetic tubes from recyclable and biodegradable materials, says FMI, with some of the leading cosmetic tubes manufacturers moving away from plastic use to recycled materials. Advanced decorating techniques are providing new visual interest to tubes as well—from vintage vibes to elegant renderings and bold hues.Tube suppliers we spoke with for this article report an uptick in production, and in many cases cite the on-shoring trend, which can ease certain supply chain difficulties. But growth in the tubes market has been ongoing. Viva has seen steady growth every year for the past decade, reports Melanie Gaudun, business development manager.Plastic squeeze tube production and decoration currently represent the larger part of second- and third-generation owned-and-operated JSN . Sandy Nagel, vice president, JSN, tells Beauty Packaging, “We are seeing modest but steady, consistent growth in our market. In addition, on-shoring continues to add to domestic manufacturing demand.” Nagel says that it’s not only Made in USA that sets them apart from their competitors, but that “the footprint of a whole package is advantaged because manufacture of tubes, decoration and closure can be accomplished timely and effectively in one location.”Growth with a few Covid-19 related blips and re-focuses were the case at Neopac , where Cornelia Schmid, marketing manager, told Beauty Packaging, “During the pandemic we saw stable growth, but travel retail and luxury cosmetics went down and there was a noticeable pivot toward less expensive brands. However, we saw increases in other areas, including sanitizers and medical brands.”Stephane Beauchemin, vice president of sales & marketing at Plastube , sums it up, saying, “The fact that tubes require less plastic than bottles for the same capacity during the manufacturing process will contribute to increase the demand for tubes.”As testimony to just how far tubes have progressed, we asked a number of leading tube suppliers in the cosmetic industry to tell us about their most recent launches, the latest trends they’re seeing in the industry, what brands are looking for—and ultimately, what consumers are demanding of their packaging in this space. Albéa provides plastic and laminate tubes, printing expertise, caps and applicators, and an extensive range of recycling-ready, paper-based, PCR and bio-based tubes.In 2020, L’Oréal and Albéa launched the “groundbreaking,” first paper-based cosmetic tubes designed to replace L’Oréal plastic cosmetic tubes in the midst of growing environmental concerns.In March of this year, LyondellBasell, Albéa Tubes and L’OCCITANE en Provence launched what they again called “groundbreaking” cosmetic tubes and caps for L’OCCITANE en Provence’s Almond range. Created to support the circular economy, the packaging is made by Albéa Tubes with CirculenRevive polymers from LyondellBasell.A member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Albéa manufactured the actual cosmetic tubes and caps for L’OCCITANE en Provence. Albéa has pledged to make all of its tubes recyclable by 2025, and increase the use of post-consumer recycled resins.L’OCCITANE en Provence, which has signed the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Global Commitment, has said they will “cultivate change” at every level, starting with the sustainable design and production of their packaging.Richard Roudeix, LyondellBasell senior vice president of Olefins and Polyolefins for Europe, Middle East, Africa and India, said, “We are excited to work with Albéa Tubes and L’OCCITANE en Provence on this project and to contribute to circular cosmetic packaging solutions. “Our CirculenRevive products, which are part of our Circulen product range of sustainable solutions, are polymers based on advanced (chemical) recycling technology from our supplier Plastic Energy who converts end-of-life plastic waste streams into pyrolysis oil feedstock.”Gilles Swyngedauw, VP of sustainability and innovation at Albéa Tubes, says, “The Almond Shower Scrub is the holy grail in terms of responsible packaging today. The tube and cap are designed for full recyclability and made of 93% recycled polyethylene (PE) content. On top, both are made of PE for higher-quality recycling, confirmed as recycling-ready by recycler associations in both Europe and the U.S. This packaging is in effect closing the loop, and that’s quite a breakthrough!”Many tube manufacturers also manufacture closures, for complete, seamless packages.Closure manufacture is a valuable asset at JSN , which began developing the Disc Top dispensing closure more than 40 years ago. Tube production began five years later. While the company now purchases tube closures “from the most reputable sources,” says Nagel, “we also produce in-house closures to complement our own tubes. This expedites special colors, special additives, and general lead-time responsiveness.” Another of JSN’s capabilities is the manufacture of custom closures—in proprietary designs, logos, and high-end nail polish closures. Conventional deco includes offset, silkscreen and hot-stamp.In tubes, JSN has been utilizing sustainable polyethylene resin from sugarcane for several years. “It is certainly our first recommended “go-to,” says Nagel, “and is readily accepted in the personal care industry. Sugarcane resin also has the great advantage of not hindering the decoration process.”Nagel says PCR is used routinely in dark colored personal care caps/closures. She explains, “PCR in a flexible tube package is more complicated due to the thin sidewalls and customer preference to avoid product contact with PCR layers. Commercially available PCR is continuing to improve, but color variation and imperfections are still a challenge. We are seeing complete redesign of some package art to accommodate [this].”Recently, JSN added production of plastic co-ex laminate tubes which allow greatly expanded decorative options on white and metallic substrates. In addition to expanded deco possibilities, this product also offers more effective inventory warehousing to permit shorter lead-time on final tube production—an attractive feature for some users, explains Nagel. Berry Global provides laminate and extruded tubes, plus matching closures, in a broad range of size styles and colors to provide the complete tube package. They offer a wide range of “brand differentiating, premium decoration options.”Vali Braselton, marketing manager, Consumer Products North America, Berry, tells Beauty Packaging, “Because there are many paths to sustainability, we offer our customers a variety of circular packaging options for tubes to help them meet their sustainability goals. Our size, scale and expertise translate into solutions that include recycled content, reduced carbon footprint, renewable material and improved recyclability.”Berry recently launched bio-resin polyethylene tubes made from HDPE sugarcane , and their single-substrate HDPE laminate tube with HDPE closure has been recognized by the APR. In addition, their laminate tubes are offered from “pellet to pallet.” This means Berry extrudes, forms, decorates and caps all tubes in their Evansville, IN facility, resulting in one of the “lowest carbon footprints in the industry,” according to Braselton.Berry recently introduced a low-profile tube, available with a matte or glossy cap, that reduces carbon footprint by using less material—specifically 24% less material in the cap and 16% less in the shoulder. The tube can be made with PCR, is made from 100% PE for improved recyclability and can be decorated just like any other laminate tube, says Braselton. Neopac manufactures PE, COEX and polyfoil tubes ranging from 10-50mm. Among other solutions, Schmid says “Our EcoDesign range comprises tubes that are lightweight and utilize recycled content or bio-based materials. In addition, Neopac has patented a recyclable mono-material-barrier tube, Polyfoil MMB, that was recently approved as recyclable by the U.S. Association of Plastic Recyclers.For specialty cosmetics, Neopac offers tubes with pumps, applicators and nozzles, and also child-resistant options for concentrates and cosmeceuticals. They also have a PE/PP cap in-house production for screw and flip-top caps.Neopac’s Stylo Pipette Tube, utilized by skincare company Filorga, incorporates an innovative pipette applicator allowing for dispensing of Filorga’s Skin-Unify radiance fluid directly onto the skin. The precision dispensing adds new levels of comfort and hygiene.The Stylo tube’s aesthetically appealing ring ensures correct discharge, and offers added product protection. An arrow pictogram helps consumers intuitively understand how to turn the ring. The cone-shaped cap safeguards the applicator, while Neopac’s polyfoil barrier laminate ensures ample formula protection.Overall, the tube’s premium look, eye-catching conical shape, transparent cap and enticing pipette applicator help Filorga’s Skin-Unify radiance fluid stand out in a crowded, competitive space.Viva specializes in manufacturing unique polypropylene (PP) tubes, applicators and caps, with in-mold label decoration. The company is vertically integrated, with tubes, closures and decoration all made under the same roof in Toronto, serving North and South America. Viva also has a production facility in Warsaw to serve the European market, and a plant in Hong Kong, where their design team works on new developments.According to Viva’s Gaudin, the company’s injection-molded tubes have a number of unique benefits, including a smooth, resilient profile that retains a round, wrinkle-free shape throughout its lifecycle; a mono-material design compatible with the rigid PP recycling stream per the APR Design Guide for Tube Recyclability; and highest content PCR, up to 90% in tube and cap combined.The beauty of in-mold label decoration, says Gaudun, is high definition, shoulder to crimp artwork with 360-degree coverage; and options for spot matte, spot gloss, foil effects and velvet soft touch finishes. Viva also designs their flip-top caps to be oriented with the customer’s artwork.One of the largest areas of growth at Viva is in tubes with PCR content. Viva can include up to 87% PCR in the tube (including sleeve, neck and shoulders) and 100% in the cap, for a combined total of 90% PCR, says Gaudin. Viva has seen steady growth every year for the past decade—and reports “extra growth” in their smallest diameter tubes (0.34 oz. to 0.75 oz.), tubes with applicators, and tubes with their highly tactile velvet soft touch finish.For more than 50 years, CTL-PACK has provided “the highest quality plastic tubes in the U.S. & European markets.” According to Andy Olsen, vice president, sales & marketing, they work with customers to develop high-end plastic tubes, premium decoration capabilities and continuous innovation for both extruded and injection molded round and elliptical plastic tubes. In the U.S., they manufacture injection molded PP in-mold-labeled tubes. According to Olsen, this technology “delivers superior decoration, improved supply chain performance (MOQ’s 5/m) and a winning sustainable package with a uniform all-PP package.”CTL PACK’s in-mold-label tubes deliver premium decoration using digital and flexography printing technology. “This allows for marketers to decorate on a flat substrate versus decorating the tube after the tube is made.” The company’s IML tubes are 100% polypropylene making them recyclable, and they can add PCR “to further the sustainability value.”Olsen says the company recently developed tubes that “showcase our ability to deliver serialization.” In this example, CTL printed 3 different images of Paris’s skyline. When placed together on the shelf, the 3 different decorated tubes produce a collage-like image. This ability can be applied to various patterns, colors, names or images to create a larger picture when viewed from a distance. Montebello offers both full aluminum tubes and laminate tubes. Steven MacPhail, vice president sales & marketing, says, “For the cosmetic industry, aluminum tubes offer the highest barrier property, and specialty head styles for controlled application as well as the vintage look.” Plastube has been manufacturing and decorating tubes aimed at the cosmetic, veterinary, pharmaceutical & food industries in North America since the start of the company in 1963. Beauchemin says Plastube “is the partner of choice for fillers and manufacturers of products packaged in tubes for small to medium size runs, and offers a multiple variety of decoration solutions including digital printing that delivers high-quality printing.”Plastube recently produced The Koyal Beauty Gentle Gel Face Wash 60ml. This is one of the first COEX-PCR tubes printed by Plastube using their digital printer, and Beauchemin says, “The result was astonishing!” Norden Machinery offers tube filling systems, cartoning and shipper box packing solutions for tubes. The portfolio ranges from speeds between 40-1,000 tubes/min. Ida Sigvardsson, marketing specialist, Norden Machinery, tells Beauty Packaging, “We work with customers using all kinds of tubes, plastic, laminates, metal and sustainable tubes.”Norden Machinery recently developed a paper-based tube, but it was not without challenges, due to the very low plastics content. “Still,” says Sigvardsson, “the pressure tests show that the laminate structure of the paper fiber separates before the sealing breaks. The customer needs to be able to trust that the tube has the same durability properties as an average tube. This was the challenge, and we managed to solve it with a good outcome.”As mentioned, the popularity of tubes is increasing due to their many benefits. Suppliers mentioned some of the chief advantages for brands and consumers.Tubes are fundamentally convenient and versatile, says Viva’s Gaudin. “To start with, they are highly portable, shower-friendly and travel-friendly. Most sizes fit nicely into the average person’s hand. It’s almost therapeutic to squeeze a tube.”Viva’s tube options include a wide variety of diameters, lengths, orifice sizes and applicator attachments, in sizes ranging from 0.34 oz. to 15.5 oz. Tubes can include barriers to support a wide range of formulations, with custom colors in the resin and in-mold label (IML) decoration to match any other existing packaging.In addition, says Gaudin, “Viva can design your tubes to meet the current requirements of the rigid PP recycling streams, and include up to 90% PCR in tube and cap combined. She cites a 2020 Life Cycle Analysis, in which Viva’s PP tubes show over 50% lower impacts in the top three categories that contribute to over 80% of the overall environmental impact of plastic tubes: global warming fine particulate matter formation, and human non-carcinogenic toxicity.At Neopac, Schmid, says among other benefits, tubes offer a superior “packaging to product” ratio compared to bottles. “They have attractive ‘good-to-empty’ rates for viscous products, creams and liquids. Tubes also offer a wide array of printing and decoration options, including various combinations of offset, silk-screen, flexo, digital printing and hot-stamping.In addition, Schmid says high-barrier tubes can provide “longer shelf life and exemplary protection against air, moisture or light.Montebello’s MacPhail tells Beauty Packaging that tubes continue to have a place in all product categories, noting that collections can be in haircare for colorants or large format tubes for shampoo. “Skincare and high-end derma require tubes to carry the expensive formulas and give some directional and controlled application,” says MacPhail. On the other hand, “Tubes offer a variety of smaller formats and are extremely portable. In the tube industry we continue to explore different materials to improve sustainability.”When it comes to sustainability, Beauchemin says Plastube tubes will generally weigh about 50% less than bottles for a comparable capacity making them a good sustainable option. Printing digitally on PCR tubes is the most sustainable option offered by Plastube because there is no ink purge at the end of the production with digital printing.CTL’s Olsen says “Tubes offer a great solution to brand owners looking for a packaging solution that delivers on fit, form and function. There can be a multitude of specs to choose from with mono-layer tubes, multi-layer tubes and various barriers and decoration capabilities. Tubes are inverted allowing consumers to evacuate the majority of their products by the nature of gravity.” He says tubes are also easy and fast to fill having a large opening [which can be] filled before being crimped and packed into shippers.Norden Machinery’s Sigvardsson points to tubes’ benefits around ease and hygiene.“Tubes are often a preferred packaging solution for cosmetics, and personal care products,” says Sigvardsson. “It is a hygienic and easy way to handle your product. You can apply the content (i.e, sunscreen or moisturizing cream) with only one hand, it is easily stored, and it is possible to pack large volumes at high speeds.” She explains that as the tube contains less packaging materials than an equivalent type of packaging, it is very efficient. Finally, she says, “the tube is a type of packaging that allows squeezing every bit of the content out, which means that no residue is left in the packaging, providing better value for the consumer, and no waste.”From ease of dispensing to innovative shapes and sizes, to sustainability, here’s what suppliers say brands are looking for in today’s tubes.At The Penthouse Group , Richard Esterbrook, director of sales, tells Beauty Packaging they have recently noticed that customers are looking for more interesting shapes in tubes, rather than the traditional round or oval shapes. While some tube vendors are able to injection mold a tube neck in different shapes like square, triangle, etc., the tube sleeve itself is usually not changed much as a result of it. However, through their “Blow Tube” innovation, Yoshino can utilize their bottle blow molding expertise to radically change the shape of the sleeve itself as well. (The Penthouse Group is the sales and customer service representative of Yoshino in North America.)The Penthouse Group has also responded to the eco-friendly call with Yoshino’s low profile flip top closure. Esterbrook says, “Sometimes simple changes to packaging can have a big impact on the environment over time.” One such idea that Yoshino commercialized in the Japan market was to minimize the height profile of a standard flip top closure, essentially making it shorter and saving cost and the amount of plastic resin used. He says, “Our hope is that by introducing this concept to the U.S. market, we can introduce a new trend so that eventually most flip top closures are transitioned to the low-profile type.”Norden Machinery’s Sigvardsson also speaks about new, innovative shapes for tubes. She says, “Some brands choose to fill their product in an oval tube, which gives an exclusive impression and a good grip in the hand. There is also Design-a-Seal, where the end of the tube can be in a bow or arched shape, making the tube look spectacular and [different].” She says one of the most creative applications that they have worked with is a foot crème with the top of the tube shaped as toes. She also cites examples of kids’ tubes where the top of the tube is shaped as a cat with ears, making it look cute and funny. “All this was possible because customers made a special request to Norden, and a special tooling was created so that the tubes could be produced in such a special design,” says Sigvardsson.As far as sustainability, Sigvardsson says, “Often, a mono-material tube is preferred, due to its recyclability. It is also popular with paper laminate and bio-plastics tubes.”At Viva, Gaudin tells Beauty Packaging that brands are looking to round out their product lines with different sizes of tubes, options for PCR content, different means of dispensing, and beautiful decoration options. Viva’s deodorant tube, powder tube, scalp applicator tube, and airless pump tubes were all developed to meet specific needs clients had for their product lineups. In addition, on the sustainable packaging front, “Viva tubes include a unique, tried and tested mono-material PP design that is compatible with the current rigid PP recycling stream,” says Gaudin.Viva recently developed the Head & Shoulders Clinical Scalp Calming Treatment Tube with a custom applicator that includes a longer nozzle than is typically available via a nose. This longer nozzle is able to navigate through hair down to the scalp area, for precision point application of a treatment that is to be applied up to four times a day. The tube comes in a convenient size for travel. The applicator is part of a mono-material design. Both tube and applicator are color-matched to the blue foil artwork, creating a continuous V-shape from the crimp down to the applicator tip, which is visible through the clear cap.”Plastube’s Beauchemin says many brand owners have made the commitment to reduce their environmental footprint by 20% - 50% by 2025 and as such are looking for greener material. He says Post Consumer Resin remains the most requested material, “which is understandable as it offers the best environmental footprint when compared to other materials.”Sustainability that doesn’t sacrifice product protection continues to dominate brands’ wish lists, says Neopac’s Schmid. “Our EcoDesign tubes offer strong barrier properties and elaborate decorative options (direct print, not labels) while comprising eco-conscious materials that can hold more than 30% PCR content; fit into existing PE or PP recycling streams (mono-material barrier tubes); be light weighted to save CO2 and plastics; are biodegradable; or have bio-based content.”At CTL, Olsen says brands are looking for small, medium and large tubes for various products in hair care, skin care, baby care and sun care to name a few. Materials range from extruded tubes (LLDPE, LPDE, MPE & HDPE) to laminate and IML polypropylene tubes. Many brands are looking for sustainable materials like sugar cane-based resin and/or post-consumer resins.It appears clear that tubes will remain a vibrant packaging category for the cosmetic industry due to their many benefits and advances in materials, sizes, dispensing and deco options. But similar to other packaging categories, challenges lie ahead as suppliers continue to meet rising demand.JSN’s Nagel says one of the primary challenges is “to reduce plastic content in plastic packaging via additions in sustainable resins, PCR content, and thin-walling existing packaging.”At Neopac, Schmid says, “Notably, the challenges we are facing as an industry include the price increase of raw materials, the scarcity of EVOH barrier material in particular, and the availability of qualified pure (food grade) PCR material on the market.”Known for its clean skincare and sustainability messaging, Summer Fridays premiered in 2018, with skincare packaged in aluminum tubes. It was not the norm at the time—but proved to be wildly successful. Beauty Packaging asked brand co-founder Lauren Ireland why they chose this packaging route. She told us:“From the start, we had a very clear vision of launching our first product in an aluminum tube. At the time, very few brands—particularly in beauty—had done it, and it felt really special. The look of a near-empty, crinkled aluminum tube of our Jet Lag Mask became a recognizable part of our brand story, as it quickly took over people’s Instagram news feeds. We believe our product’s unique packaging really helped catapult the success of the brand.“Of course, beyond the aesthetics of it, an aluminum tube is also recyclable, and sustainability was important to us and to our community. Our first three products—all face masks—were put into aluminum tubes. While we now have a wide product range and therefore a variety of packaging, our aluminum tubes are core to our brand and our long-term efforts of sourcing solutions that are both sustainable and practical.”With a heritage in sustainable practices, the Dutch-owned brand Bloomeffects creates products and packaging in sync with their DNA—for a true “field-to-face” beauty experience. Their multitasking Tulip Tint Lip & Cheek Balm is now available in 3 universal shades for all skin tones.Bloomeffects supports circular farming practices through the upcycling of imperfect tulip bulbs that would otherwise be discarded as “waste” and revitalizes them as ingredients in their skincare collection.The same care is given to their packaging, which tells the brand’s story at first glance. All Bloomeffects product cartons are FSC certified, made from 100% recycled materials, and are 100% recyclable. Tulip Tint packaging is made with PICEA wood tubes made from sawdust from German carpenters and other materials from renewable resources, “resulting in a carbon footprint that is 40% smaller than conventional plastic tubes.” The brand says it is also the first beauty brand to use PICEA in the U.S. Cartons are FSC-certified, made from 100% recycled materials and are 100% recyclable.",,[],[]

The Best Color Pigment For Epoxy Resin,"Epoxy resin is a versatile product for crafting (and other household applications) because it comes as a clear liquid adhesive that can be shaped and molded. Once a hardener is added, it then becomes solid. This makes it perfect for creating items like jewelry, ornaments, coasters, and other attractive decorative items.

Medium- and high-viscosity epoxies have consistencies like thick honey and are suitable for coating surfaces. You can use them to make many kinds of resin art. For the most part, epoxy resins are colorless and transparent, and you have to take safety precautions when working with them.

Artists and crafters who use epoxy resins usually like to add color to create attractive designs within the medium. Never use paints that contain water, though, as this could prevent the resin from curing or cause other problems.

The two main kinds of coloring agents you can use for epoxy resins are liquid-form color concentrates and powdered color pigments. You can also use some of these to create soap, makeup and other small goods.

Always opt for high-quality products because they have the most vibrant colors, are easiest to blend and last the longest. Some feature translucent, pearlescent and other reflective finishes that make your pieces look exciting and luminous. Before adding color, though, you will have to mix the resin.

Pour a small amount of the color pigment into the mixture before it hardens, and stir with a mixing stick. Only add a small amount at a time because you can always drop in a bit more; once the color is wrong or too dark, you may have to start over. Follow the package directions for mixing and use your judgment for the color; both novices and pros like to experiment here, and the results vary.",,[],[]
A green protocol for the electrochemical synthesis of a fluorescent dye with antibacterial activity from imipramine oxidation,"Mechanistic studies

Cyclic voltammetry was used to study the redox behavior, pH-dependent properties and electron transfer mechanism of IMP in aqueous solution. The pH dependent behavior of IMP was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Figure 1 shows the cyclic voltammograms of IMP at different pH values. As can be seen, the IMP exhibits complex and different behaviors. For example, while peak C 1 is present at pH values less than 2, it is not seen at higher pH values. Or peak C 0 is seen in the pH range 3–6 and is gradually removed as the pH increases. On the other hand, while voltammograms show one or two anodic peaks up to pH 6, the number of anodic peaks increases to three as the pH increases further. The fundamental change in the electrochemical behavior of IMP in alkaline media may be due to the participation of IMP in hydroxylation and/or hydrolysis reactions. These results indicate high complexity in IMP oxidation. In previous studies, we have been able to identify some oxidation pathways of this compound46,47. Based on our previous data, peak A 1 is attributed to the one-electron oxidation of IMP to the corresponding radical cation and peak C 1 is related to the reduction of radical cation to IMP46,47. In this work, we pay attention to the behavior of IMP in the pH range 3–6.

Figure 1 Cyclic voltammograms of IMP (1.0 mM) at glassy carbon electrode in aqueous solutions at different pH values. Scan rate: 100 mV s−1, at room temperature. Full size image

Figure 2, curves a and b shows the first and second cyclic voltammograms of IMP in the aqueous solution (pH 5.0) at scan rate of 50 mV s−1. As can be seen, in the first scan, two anodic peaks A 1 and A 2 are observed over the whole potential range. When the potential is switched to negative potentials, a new reduction peak (C 0 ) appears at a potential of 0.13 V versus Ag/AgCl and in the second cycle, a new anodic peak (A 0 ) (counterpart of C 0 peak) appears with E p of 0.19 V versus Ag/AgCl. Figure 2, curve c shows the cyclic voltammogram of IMP over the limited potential range up to 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl. The presence of peak C 0 in the voltammogram in these conditions indicates its independence from peak A 2 . Increasing the scan rate in these situations has three important consequences (Fig. 2, curve d). First, decrease the anodic peak current ratio (I pA2 /I pA1 ). Second, decrease the cathodic-to anodic peak current ratio (I pC0 /I pA1 ) and third, appearance of the peak C 1 .

Figure 2 © is similar to curve a, but with a more limited potential range. Curve (d) is similar to curve a, but at scan rate of 800 mV s−1. Curves (a, b) First and second cyclic voltammograms of IMP (1.0 mM) at glassy carbon electrode in water (acetate buffer, c = 0.2 M, pH 5.0), at room temperature. Curve Full size image

In order to better understand the oxidation reaction mechanism at pH 5, here we performed a controlled-potential coulometry (CPC) experiment to determine the number of transferred electrons and recorded the cyclic voltammograms of the solution during the coulometry. For this purpose, CPC was carried out in aqueous solution (80 ml buffer, pH 5.0) containing 0.25 mmol of IMP at the potential of 0.85 V versus Ag/AgCl. Figure 3, shows the cyclic voltammograms of IMP during controlled-potential coulometry. As can be seen, I pA1 and I pA2 decrease with time (electricity consumption), while I pA0 and I pC0 increase slightly. Also, the number of electrons exchanged in this experiment was found to be slightly more than 6 electrons.

According to these results together with the spectroscopic data of the isolated product as well as our previous studies46,47, we proposed the following mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of IMP at the pH 5 (Fig. 4). Since the spectroscopic data of the synthetic product show that the alkyl group is not involved the final product, it seems that the first step in the oxidation of IMP is the cleavage of the alkyl group from IMP (formation of IMPH), during an oxidative dealkylation reaction48. In the next step, IMPH is oxidized to the corresponding radical cation via a one-electron-transfer process. This compound is converted to IMPH-OH after hydroxylation (due to water attack) and then aromatization. In the next step, the IMPH-OH is converted to the corresponding radical cation by a one electron transfer process (IMPH-OH•+). The reaction of two radical cations of IMPH-OH together, followed by aromatization, forms the corresponding dimer (DIMER1). Finally, a two-electron oxidation process, together with a rearrangement, converts DIMER1 to the final product (DIMP).

Based on the available results, peak A 1 and its cathodic counterpart (C 1 ) (see Fig. 1) are correspond to one-electron oxidation of IMP to IMP•+ and vice versa. In this regard, due to the removal of peak A 2 at high scan rates, this peak is related to the over-oxidation of IMPH•+ to IMPH++ (Fig. 5).

Figure 5 Proposed reaction for generation of peak A 2 . Full size image

In order to determine the species causing peaks A 0 and C 0 , the cyclic voltamogram of the isolated product (DIMP) is shown in Fig. 6. The cyclic voltammogram shows a pair of anodic and cathodic peaks at 0.16 and 0.11 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively, which are compatible with the potential of peaks A 0 and C 0 . Accordingly, the molecules that create peaks A 0 and C 0 and the redox behavior of them are shown in Fig. 7.

Figure 7 The redox behavior of A 0 /C 0 peaks. Full size image

The second point that can be understood from this cyclic voltammogram is the presence of cathodic currents at the beginning of the potential scan. These currents are related to the reduction of the compound present at the electrode surface before the compound is oxidized at the potential of peak A 1 . In other words, these currents indicate that the product is in oxide form. These results are consistent with the structure of the DIMP which is in its oxidized form.

An important point to note about hydroxylation of IMPH•+ is the location of the hydroxyl group in IMPH-OH molecule49,50. IMPH•+ can be attacked by water from two places A and B and become two different products according to Fig. 4 (Fig. 8). In the structures shown in Fig. 8, the hydrogens of the quinone rings have different positions relative to each other. In structure A, the hydrogens of the quinone rings are in ortho positions, while in structure B, the hydrogens of the quinone rings are in para positions. We confirm the formation of structure A according to the results obtained from the NMR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction product (DIMP), shows clearly two doublet peaks with J = 10 and 8 Hz at δ 6.64 and 7.64 ppm, respectively, showing coupling to the two ortho protons. These results are consistent with structure A.

Figure 8 Possible structures due to the increase of water to different positions of the IMPH•+ molecule. Full size image

In addition, it is possible that the rearrangement of IMPH-OH•+ is preceded by different mechanisms and leads to the formation of a different products (DD and CD), as shown in Fig. 9. But we reject these mechanisms because of the results obtained from NMR spectra. As reported in the experimental section, the carbon NMR spectrum of the synthesized compound has a peak at 187.8 ppm, which corresponds to carbonyl groups, while the product, DD, shown in Fig. 9 has no carbonyl group. This finding causes us to reject the formation of DD product. On the other hand, the structure of the CD compound shows that this molecule is an asymmetric molecule, so that in its proton and carbon spectra, the number of peaks and their patterns are completely different from that of the synthesized product (DIMP). These findings rule out the formation of CD molecule as a final product.

UV–visible and fluorescence characteristics of DIMP

In this part, spectrophotometric techniques were used to characterization of the ground state and the singlet excited state of synthesized product (DIMP) by means of absorption and fluorescence methods. Figure 10 shows the UV–visible spectrum of 0.5 mM IMP and DIMP in chloroform. As can be seen, the absorption spectrum of IMP shows two bands at 270 and 295 nm were attributed to π → π* transitions associated with the aromatic rings9,51,52 (Fig. 10, inset). A red shift was observed when the UV–visible spectrum has been carried out from DIMP, which can be related to the absence of the N-alkyl chain which has been replaced by hydrogen during electrochemical oxidation53. This result indicates that the alkyl chain-substituent affects the electronic transitions of the chromophore53. Also, the broad band from 400 to 520 nm with its maximum centered at 440 nm, is due to the conjugated double bonds51. The synthesized compound (DIMP) is colored (reddish yellow) and therefore may be used as a dye54,55,56. Based on this, the color quality of this compound has been evaluated and approved in the quality control laboratory of Alvan Sabet Company.

Figure 11 shows the fluorescence spectrum of 0.5 mM DIMP in chloroform. For this experiment the fluorescence was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 535 nm at a 90° angle relative to the excitation light. Under these conditions, the emission wavelength of DIMP was found to be 625 nm. The conjugated bands in the structure of DIMP (Fig. 4) caused to emergence of fluorescence properties in this compound.

Antibacterial susceptibility

The synthesized product DIMP was tested to evaluate the antibacterial activity. The effect of DIMP (30 mg ml−1) on the four strains was assayed by agar well diffusion method and further confirmed by disk diffusion method. Four bacterial: Bacillus cereus (ATCC 14759), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Shigella sonei (ATCC 9290) used in our study (Fig. 12). Antobiogram test showed that the all gram positive and all gram negative bacteria (tested in this research) was sensitive to DIMP. For determination of minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) of the DIMP to inhibit the microorganisms more studies are necessary and microdilution method is recommended. The result of antibacterial activity of the DIMP compound is summarized in Table 1. These properties introduce DIMP as a fluorescent dye with antibacterial activity.

Chemistry lab’s focus on plastics inspires Earth Day cleanup,"Earth Day comes twice a year for University of Michigan chemistry professor Anne McNeil and her lab — at least it has since last year.

On Earth Day 2021, the McNeil lab organized the inaugural Huron River Watershed Cleanup. Graduate and undergraduate students in LSA’s Department of Chemistry picked up thousands of pieces of trash from about 20 metroparks along the Huron River in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti.

The event was so successful that the group repeated the event in the fall, when they picked up 13,575 items, including 4,494 cigarette filters. The community cleanup days felt like a natural extension of what McNeil’s lab focuses on: the chemical recycling and upcycling of plastics.

“People had just felt content with how recycling is done currently. When it is collected — which isn’t that much — it’s taken to a facility, sorted and chopped up. Then, they remelt the plastic and try to make something else,” said McNeil, professor of chemistry and of macromolecular science and engineering. “But the dirty little secret of that type of recycling is that the properties of the plastic degrade because the recycled product is just a mixture of really different components.”

That is, the same kind of plastic produced by different companies might consist of materials with different molecular weights, colorants and stabilizers — even a different way of producing the plastic. That means you end up with things like park benches and carpet fibers made of recycled plastic, but which can’t be recycled again, McNeil said.

Instead, McNeil decided to begin looking into ways her lab could use chemicals to break plastic materials into their constituent parts, then using those parts to build a different useful material.

“On the research side, we thought, let’s keep the value in plastics using chemistry,” she said. “Our lab slowly started shifting toward a major focus on chemical recycling.”

With her lab’s focus, McNeil began thinking about how chemistry researchers might do community outreach.

She takes daily walks with her kids, during which they pick up trash they find. The ritual sparked an idea, and McNeil made a suggestion in her lab’s Slack: What if they organized cleanup days in parks in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, along the Huron River?

This video highlights the work of Huron River cleanup volunteers.

Danielle Fagnani, a postdoctoral researcher in the McNeil lab, helped organize the first Earth Day event.

“We’re thinking about this stuff all the time in the lab, and what’s unique about this research area is that it’s so tangible to everyday life,” Fagnani said. “Everyone — scientists, nonscientists — uses plastics and hears about this waste crisis, and you can see it when you’re walking outside. So it was natural for us to be interested in cleaning that up.”

Turning diapers into microplastic catchers and PVC into drug delivery systems

The McNeil lab began to turn its attention to chemically recycling plastic with the work of Takunda Chazovachii, a graduate student researcher who recently graduated from U-M to work at the global paint company PPG. Chazovachii focused on chemically recycling the superabsorbent polymers in diapers, using them to make the same kind of adhesives in sticky notes and on the back of removable wall hooks.

Fagnani has focused on how to chemically recycle polyvinyl chloride, or PVC. Plumbing pipes are composed of PVC, as are plastic tubing used in hospitals, water bottles, bank and credit cards, and thousands of other items. It’s one of the most widely used plastics in the world. It also can’t be recycled.

“In the U.S., for PVC, the recycling rate is virtually zero,” Fagnani said. “It uses phthalate plasticizers, which are toxic, and although they’re being phased out, they’re still abundant in PVC formulations. Additionally, polyvinyl chloride releases hydrochloric acid gas under thermal conditions, which is really bad for recycling plants. So what I’ve done in my work is turn these negatives into a positive using a chemical method.”

Using electrochemistry, Fagnani is developing a way to slowly release hydrochloric acid from PVC at room temperature.

“Fifty-seven percent of the mass of PVC is chloride atoms. I’m recovering that portion of the polymer and then using it directly in a subsequent reaction to chlorinate other materials. That’s what we call value-added materials,” she said.

“We’ve also found that phthalates actually improve the efficiency of this process. So we found basically a new purpose for the chlorine content of PVC, and then we found a new purpose for the phthalate content of polyvinyl plastics formulations.”

What she and her colleagues have done so far is proof-of-concept, but chloride atoms are used in making agricultural chemicals and pharmaceutical materials, such as drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s disease. Plus, the reaction is done at room temperature, which saves energy because most plastics recycling requires heat to break the plastics down.

“Electrochemistry, electrosynthesis, is generally thought of as a green technique,” Fagnani said. “Doing a chemical reaction at 25 degrees Celsius — room temperature — is usually going to be lower energy than heating something up to 200 degrees to mechanically recycle it.”

Postdoctoral researcher Woojung Ji is continuing Chazovachii’s work. Chazovachii and McNeil discovered that the adhesive he made from diaper polymers trapped microplastics derived from rubber tires. Now, Ji is working to optimize these chemical adhesives to best capture different types of microplastics, and the lab is collaborating with Brian Love, a professor in the College of Engineering, among others, to develop devices that can capture microplastics out of wastewater treatment centers.

There is a kind of direct connection to McNeil’s lab through her Earth Day cleanups. Plastic left on the ground will break down, degrading into microplastics that can find their way into water systems.

Studies have found that microplastics have worked their way into the bodies of fish. A study suggests humans eat, drink or breathe up to a credit card-sized amount of plastics each week. Another recent study has found microplastics embedded in people’s lungs. McNeil’s focus on the Huron River watershed removes at least a small amount of plastic that could end up in the river, and ultimately, in Lake Erie.

Community outreach and COVID-safe socializing

Fagnani says the cleanup days are also a good way to socialize across the department in a way that was safe during the start of the pandemic.

“Our first event, on Earth Day 2021, was a year after COVID started, and that was a year of some Zoom stuff — a lot of Zoom stuff — but no event that was safely in-person. This was part of our intention: to have a safe event with small teams of three to four people, spread out at different parks,” Fagnani said. “That way, people in our department could meet other people in the department. For a lot of people, that was part of why they participated.”

Earth Day 2022 is April 22, and the lab’s cleanup day is set for April 23.

U-M undergraduate student Chase Dautrich, a junior pursuing a major in the environment in LSA’s Program in the Environment and minoring in business, participated in the Earth Day event. He took a course called The Anthropocene, taught by McNeil, which influenced his choice to “specialize in natural capital accounting and pursue a career in corporate accountability.”

“So many well-intentioned people give into fervor around climate activism after being influenced by social factors more than scientific ones, and it creates a challenge in working together because the ‘people in charge’ are more attached to their politics than finding comprehensive solutions,” Dautrich said. “This class was helpful because it gave students a well contextualized and empirical background in climate change, encouraging us to decide for ourselves whether we are living in ‘The Anthropocene.'”

He said the amount of trash they encountered was unsurprising.

“Picking up trash was nice because I got to connect with the other volunteers in my group who had similar backgrounds in STEM at U-M,” Dautrich said. “The trash collection itself wasn’t super novel just since we’re all exposed to so much plastic pollution every day. But of course, it’s still disheartening to consider how much of our plastic ends up in the environment that we don’t clean up.”

This is something McNeil feels acutely — as do other researchers. Her idea was inspired by Megan Feiser, a professor at the University of Southern California who leads similar cleanup days on a beach in California.

McNeil talked with Feiser, who helped McNeil design participation waivers and helped with ideas about safety guidelines. The cleanup crew was instructed to take pictures of hazardous or oversized items and send them to McNeil, who sent the photos to park employees.

Feiser also told McNeil about an app the chemistry researchers could use to log the materials they found. Called Marine Debris Tracker, the open-data app can be used by citizen scientists to log trash they find. Researchers can then access this data to track the kind of materials that find their way into the environment.

McNeil considers herself a lifelong environmentalist, and refocusing the energy of her lab, and its community outreach, is a way to honor that.

“I’ve been an environmentalist for a really long time, but I haven’t, until these last few years, connected my passion for chemistry with my passion for the environment,” she said. “Moving in this direction and organizing something like this cleanup is kind of a way to finally have these two halves of me become a whole.”",,[],['Byline']
"Nova Chemicals, Enerkem Move Forward with Advanced Recycling Pilot","Canadian companies Nova Chemicals and Enerkem are moving forward with their chemical recycling aka advanced recycling collaboration. The two have announced construction of a pilot-scale reactor in Edmonton, Alberta, to convert syngas made from hard-to-recycle plastic into a feedstock for virgin-grade polyethylene.

The pilot program combines Nova’s expertise in petrochemicals and plastic production with Enerkem’s waste-converting, gasification technology. Nova expects to start commissioning the unit in the second half of 2022, with completion targeted for spring 2023. Testing will commence post start-up.

The syngas for the pilot’s reactor will be produced at the Enerkem Alberta Biofuels (EAB) plant; the gas will be made from used, nonrecyclable, and noncompostable plastic.

The EAB plant “currently accepts municipal solid-waste biomass from the City of Edmonton that contains up to 30% fossil carbon from plastics, textiles, and other materials in the waste,” Bill Santos, future focus director, Nova Chemicals, tells PlasticsToday.

Nova and Enerkem will use the pilot system “for the accurate measurement of heat and mass-transfer characteristics as well as various other process aspects that will inform our engineering teams and allow us to bring the technology to commercial scale,” Santos says. “The new scale-up unit is planned to be located in a facility adjacent to the commercial facility that is equipped with a small pipeline that can provide syngas from the commercial unit to the test facility.”

Nova Chemicals

Nova calculates that the successful implementation of the pilot technology in Alberta could reduce local CO 2 emissions by about 165,000 tonnes/181,881 tons of CO 2 equivalent per year while diverting 230,000 tonnes/253,532 tons of waste from landfill, including more than 100,000 tonnes/110,231 tons of mixed plastic waste.

“The pilot will be considered a success when Nova and Enerkem are able to scale up and produce circular plastics on a commercial scale using made-in-Alberta technology,” Santos says.

“Our desire is to have Alberta emerge as a leader in advanced recycling and the circular economy by leveraging this innovative technology platform to divert waste from landfills, create value-added products, and reduce [greenhouse gas] emissions,” he adds.

Funding for the Nova/Enerkem pilot comes partly from Alberta Innovates, which provided CDN$4.5 million — the equivalent of $3.54 million at today’s currency conversion rate — through its Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) Economic Recovery Program. The full budget for the pilot is CDN $9,757,200/US $7,674,916.",,[],[]

Why I Swear By Ceremonia's Shampoo And Conditioner Set,"Ceremonia Ceremonia shampoo and conditioner

Welcome to HuffPost’s Simple Pleasures, where I’m writing about the one purchase that made me happiest over the last few weeks, producing a much-needed hit of shopping serotonin. Today, we’re talking about hair care essentials. Specifically, Ceremonia’s Wash Day set.

Having come of age in the early aughts when pin-straight hair was king, I spent decades frying my thick, wavy and frizzy mane with a flat iron. Over the past several years, I’ve tried to embrace a less-is-more approach, have stopped coloring it, avoiding heat styling tools unless necessary and looking for products with high-quality ingredients that aid in the long-term health of my hair.

But this hasn’t solved the problem of what to do with my frustratingly frizzy texture. It seems that any frizz-taming products I try leave my hair looking and feeling flat, lifeless and oily — not to mention the fact that they eradicate any trace of my natural wave pattern.

To be perfectly honest, I spent years neglecting my hair and scalp for the sake of investing in my face. I always felt that I had to choose between my skin and my hair, that it was too much of a time and financial drain to try and keep up with both. As a result, I’ve long made do with run-of-the-mill hair care products that weren’t necessarily tailored to my hair type and needs.

But all that changed when I came upon hair care brand Ceremonia. The brand’s founder, Babba Rivera, wanted to fill what she felt was a void in the hair care industry for beauty products that cater to the many different kinds of Latinx hair textures and needs. All of the products in the brand’s lineup are inspired by Latinx rituals and make use of lush, nurturing and luxurious ingredients commonly found in traditional Latinx communities.

I got my hands on the shampoo and conditioner, called Champú de Yucca & Witch Hazel and Acondicionador de Cupuaçu & Castor, respectively, and I don’t see myself ever going back to regular drugstore brands. Luxurious and nurturing, they turn an everyday shower into a true spa experience.

The shampoo is as moisturizing as it is an effective cleanser; my hair has never felt smoother or softer immediately post-use, while still feeling super fresh. It’s formulated with yucca extract and witch hazel, which make it a really successful purifier that doesn’t strip your scalp or hair of its natural oils. I often find that most shampoos leave my hair feeling rough and dry, so this healthy, nourished sensation is an absolute dream.

That said, my partner, who has much thinner, finer hair than my own, found that it makes her hair feel a bit oily. It’s definitely formulated for thicker or coarser textures like mine.

The conditioner is insanely hydrating and able to fully tame my wild frizz without messing with actual waves. There’s nothing I hate more than when my hair feels limp and lifeless. But cupuaçu butter and caster oil leave my hair feeling healthy, shiny and soft, regardless of whether I blow dry or let it air dry.

And can we talk about the scent? I am very sensitive to products with fragrance and easily get headaches from anything that smells artificial or chemical-y, but the Ceremonia products smell like an absolute tropical dream. I get so many compliments on the smell when I head out with freshly washed hair.

One of the things that initially drew me to Ceremonia is its commitment to sustainability. The brand uses use recycled and low-waste packaging; its bottles are made with at least 30% post-consumer-recycled PET material, which requires the least amount of energy to be produced and recycled.

Ceremonia also is incredibly transparent when it comes to its ingredients list, and its sustainable, eco-friendly vegan products are free of some of the most common allergens, irritants and hormone disruptors. You won’t find any silicones, parabens, phthalates, sulfates, artificial colorants, formaldehyde or any other common problematic ingredients here.

In fact, one of my favorite things about this shampoo is that despite the fact that it is sulfate-free, it actually lathers, so my hair feels super clean after using it, but without that stripped-off feeling. And since the conditioner is silicone-free, I have peace of mind knowing that while it’s still deeply hydrated and silky, it isn’t just a false sense of smoothness masked under plastics. It just doesn’t get much better than that.

Don’t just take my word for it; reviews for Ceremonia’s Wash Day set speak for themselves. Keep scrolling to pick up these truly lovely simple pleasures for yourself.

Sustainable fashion: Biomaterial revolution replacing fur and skins,"Innovators around the globe are achieving inspiring results using natural sources, traditional knowledge, and advanced biotechnology techniques to develop sustainable materials for the fashion industry, replacing fur, leather and skins, and slashing the impacts of one of the world’s most polluting industries.

Although companies of this type still represent a tiny part of the global textile chain, such firms grew fivefold between 2017 and 2019. Executives of apparel companies recently surveyed say they “aspire to source at least half of their products with such materials by 2025.”

This shift in production and corporate mentality is due to several factors, including pressure from animal rights activists and environmental organizations, along with consumer demand, comes as the climate and environmental crises deepen.

“Sustainable materials are pivotal if we are to transform the fashion industry from one of the most polluting industries to one that is transformative, regenerative and more humane, caring both for the environment and the people it touches in its complex supply chain,” says fashion designer Carmen Hijosa.

In a globally interconnected world, textiles such as leather sourced from cattle, and wool sheared from sheep, have become a serious source of deforestation, other adverse land-use impacts, biodiversity loss and climate change, while fur farms (harvesting pelts from slaughtered mink, foxes, raccoon dogs and other cage-kept wild animals) have become a major biohazard to human health — a threat underlined by the risk fur farms pose to the current and future spread of zoonotic diseases like COVID-19.

But in a not-so-distant future, fashion biomaterials made from plant leaves, fruit waste, and lab-grown microorganisms may replace animal-derived textiles — including leather, fur, wool and silk — with implementation at first on a small but quickly expanding scale, but eventually on a global scale.

In fact, that trend is well underway. In less than a decade, dozens of startups have emerged, developing a range of biomaterials that, in addition to eliminating the use of animal products, incorporate sustainable practices into their production chains.

Not all these textile companies, mostly based in Europe and the United States, have fully achieved their goals, but they continue to experiment and work toward a new fashion paradigm. Among promising discoveries: vegan bioleather made with mycelium (the vegetative, threadlike part of fungi), and bioexotic skins made from cactus and pineapple leaves, grape skins and seeds, apple juice, banana stalks and coconut water. There are also new textiles based on algae that can act as carbon sinks, and vegan silk made from orange peel.

It’s all part of a promising sustainable textile revolution that has the potential to stylishly clothe both the high- and fast-fashion customer.

According to a 2019 report, “Fashion’s New Must-Have: Sustainable Sourcing at Scale,” researched by the McKinsey & Company consulting firm, sustainable materials only represent a small fraction of global fashion production today, but recorded a stunning “five-fold increase [in growth] over the past two years.”

Seventy-four such companies are listed in “The State of the Industry Report: Next-Gen Materials,” released last year by the Material Innovation Initiative (MII), a California-based nonprofit that promotes animal-free materials. Of that total, 42 firms were established since 2014. The number of companies is even longer, though. Firms like Post Carbon Lab (U.K.), Chip[s] Board (U.K.), and SeaWear, for example, aren’t listed.

These pathfinding multidisciplinary companies — staffed by designers, biochemists, genetic and material engineers, biologists and textile specialists — in addition to being suppliers of textiles, clothing and accessories to manufacturers, have also been partnering with major fashion brands to further develop their research and gain scale. Awards created by conglomerates such as the H&M Foundation and the Kering Group provide grants and technical support for projects in their early stages.

Sustainable fashion’s environmental implications

The evolution of sustainable biomaterials is largely a response to the need to reduce the environmental impact of the fashion industry, one of the worst planetary polluters. “The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of annual global carbon emissions, more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined [and responsible for] around 20% of worldwide wastewater [that] comes from fabric dyeing and treatment,” according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

The fashion industry is also connected to Amazon deforestation. The share of the Brazilian Amazon involved in the country’s leather production has been growing since 2000, when it was only 7%. That jumped to 27% in 2010 and 43% in 2020.

More than 100 global brands “are working with manufacturers and tanneries that are sourced from companies with links to cattle raised on recently deforested Amazon land,” according to a study released in November by Slow Factory, an NGO. Among them are Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Prada, Nike, Zara, H&M, Louis Vuitton, Coach and Tory Burch.

In fact, it was a visit to a leather tannery in the Philippines — her first ever in 15 years as a designer and consultant on luxury leather products — that convinced Carmen Hijosa to never work with animal skins again.

As part of their industrial process, tanneries need to prevent newly made leather from decomposing by altering its protein structure using a potent chemical cocktail containing potential human carcinogens, including formaldehyde and azo colorants.

Hijosa’s 1993 visit to the Philippine tannery spurred her research into leather alternatives. While still in the Philippines, the Spanish designer learned of an old local fashion tradition: the use of pineapple-leaf fibers to make handwoven textiles. So Hijosa focused her research on pineapple’s potential and went back to school to study textiles. In 2013, she founded a London startup, Ananas Anam. The next year, at age 62, she gained her Ph.D. The result of her journey is Piñatex, a trademarked fabric made from waste pineapple leaves and already sold in 80 countries.

“Sustainable materials are pivotal if we are to transform the fashion industry from one of the most polluting industries to one that is transformative, regenerative and more humane, caring both for the environment and the people it touches in its complex supply chain,” said Hijosa. “It is our responsibility as material designers and manufacturers to develop living systems that make this change possible.”

Piñatex still has a challenge to overcome: While its finishing coating is 50% bio-based, the other 50% is made up of a petroleum-based resin applied to strengthen the material. Ananas Anam is currently working with a chemical company to make a fully bio-based coating.

Plant substitutes for leather and fabrics

After working with organic cotton, hemp and bamboo fibers, the Swiss fashion company QWSTION learned about abacá, a plant in the banana family also native to the Philippines, with strong fibers. Used by locals to make textiles since before Europeans arrived in the 1500s, “the fiber had good potential to become a material for outdoor clothing and accessories,” Hannes Schönegger, QWSTION’s CEO and co-founder told Mongabay.

According to Schönegger, abacá is produced using permaculture, so is grown surrounded by other plant species rather than existing as a monoculture. “Very often it is cultivated with cocoa trees and bigger plants that give shade. [Only] the side stems from the banana plant are chopped off to extract the raw material, so it keeps on growing for 30-40 years.”

It took three years of research in partnership with a yarn specialist and a weaving manufacturer, both based in Taiwan, to create Bananatex, launched in 2018. In addition to accessories already made with the biodegradable fabric and sold in QWSTION’s flagship stores, other brands and retail partners are creating prototypes using the abacá-derived textile, with some products likely available to consumers soon, said Schönegger.

The company is also currently testing bacteria dyeing as an alternative to digital print, a method used in making handbags. “We try to use the least harmful dyes that are available in industrial quantities. However, dyeing is an area that definitely needs improvement, added Schönegger. Synthetic chemical textile dyes have a notorious history as pollutants.

Another major issue confronting Bananatex and other companies is the environmental impacts of the global fashion supply chain. In the case of Bananatex, its product is sourced in the Philippines, moves to Taiwan for processing, then to China for manufacture, and finally arrives in Europe to be sold in stores and also over the Internet. That globe-trotting itinerary generates a lot of greenhouse gas emissions.

“In an international economy — and the textile industry is one of the most globalized areas — it is best to produce close to where materials grow and distribute the [finished] products afterwards. Because of that, Bananatex was born from the idea of creating a supply chain with short distances in Asia,” said Schönegger. “Things have to be transported at some point. And a closer look often reveals unexpected facts: Transporting a backpack from Hong Kong to Hamburg by ship creates less CO2 than from Portugal to Hamburg by truck.”

Fur from a petri dish

Mink farms, long a target of animal rights activists, generally try to keep a very low profile. But that has become increasingly difficult since the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected U.S. and EU fur-producing mink farms in 2020, underlining the potential of those facilities for transmitting zoonotic diseases, and leading to calls by epidemiologists and public health experts for them to be shut down.

“Any time we can avoid housing animals in high-density settings, we diminish the risk of [animal-to-human, and human-to-wildlife] spillover events for potential pathogens. Raising animals for fur can certainly represent a high-density scenario. So if [alternatives to the] fur industry are successful, they could reduce fur farming and thus emerging infection disease risk,” Michael Oglesbee, director of the Infectious Diseases Institute in Columbus, Ohio, told Mongabay.

Current alternatives to animal fur are made mostly from recycled polyester, an entirely petroleum-based fiber that contributes to climate change. A potentially more environmentally friendly option is Koba, a brand owned by the Chinese company Ecopel, whose faux fur uses a synthetic fiber manufactured by chemical giant DuPont, but which is made from corn byproducts resulting from biofuel production and petroleum-derived terephthalic acid. Ecopel claims a 63% greenhouse gas emission reduction for its faux fur. Contacted by Mongabay, Ecopel did not respond for comment.

Some startups are paving the way for faux fur production through biotechnology, a field that modifies living organisms to develop a variety of products. One such firm is the Dutch company GENEUSBIOTECH, founded in 2017 by Henri Kunz, a serial biotechnology entrepreneur, and Maria Zakurnaeva, who worked in the fashion industry.

When Kunz and scientist Sundar Pattabiraman produced human hair follicles in vitro, Zakurnaeva had a revelation: “Why not take advantage of this technology to produce fur, and thus avoid the death of animals?” The research team expanded its work and is now even developing wool grown without sheep. Its biomaterial fur and wool products are being made under the FUROID brand.

“We are at a stage where we have produced small organoids, a three-dimensional mass of tissue, by growing induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs),” Pattabiraman, FUROID’s chief scientific officer, told Mongabay. “These cells have been proliferated to make hair-like protrusions coming out of them. But more extensive research needs to be performed to further this project in terms of reproducibility and to [achieve] a larger scale.”

The process uses stem cells, from which all other body cells with specialized functions are generated, which are obtained by biopsy from living mink and Merino sheep. In a next step, those cells are cultured and reprogrammed into iPSCs to make fur hair follicles.

“We use a maximum of five punch biopsies per animal, after approval from an ethics committee and under supervision of a veterinary doctor, who performs the anesthesia. All animals are kept as pets and monitored by experienced staff. We own five sheep at a university farm in New Zealand and five minks. They are sufficient to produce an endless supply of cell lines,” said Kunz. “The life expectancy of our donor animals is high, especially sheep, and we spare no effort and costs to give them the best life they deserve.”

GENEUSBIOTECH reports that its FUROID project has received a Horizon Europe grant from the EU in excess of 4 million euros ($4.4 million), and is also being supported financially by an angel donor, family and friends. The company is in talks with industry stakeholders as possible investors. The firm intends to eventually use more species as donor animals to create its biomaterials, including sable, fox and even crocodile.

Fashion bounty from the sea

Ocean species are also becoming a source of sustainable fabrics, says Mike Allen, an associate professor in the College of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Exeter, U.K.

“Marine microbes … evolved in the oceans over a billion years before [they did] in the terrestrial environment. Because of that, the oceans are teeming with metabolic diversity, which can offer solutions to many of our current and future problems. You name a problem, there is a microbe out there that can help overcome it,” Allen told Mongabay.

The marine biotechnologist explained the advantages of biological modes of production over more traditional ones: “Physical [production] processes generally demand a lot of energy (heat and pressure), while chemical ones are reliant on bulk commodity synthetics [which may be toxic] … As a result, fashion textiles are restricted in their nature.

“Biological solutions to materials, on the other hand, are usually smarter,” Allen continued. “They exploit living organisms to do the hard work with a lower energetic input of manufacturing, and have properties that you can control and engineer for your particular application. Strength, grip, biodegradability, water resistance, antimicrobial, color, luminescence, fluorescence, self-cleaning, self-repairing, self-lighting: You are limited only by your [own] imagination.”

There are many other examples of fashion biomaterial initiatives now underway with private companies around the globe. A few innovative examples: Vegan leather and exotic skins :

Mylo (U.S.): Biotechnology company Bolt Threads has developed a textile derived from mycelium, the root structure of fungi, and processed into leather-like sheets. Mylo is certified 50-85% bio-based, though it still employs chemicals in the tanning and dyeing process.

Desserto (Mexico): The Adriano Di Marti company cultivates nopal cactus in the state of Zacatecas, and it is the source of a new fashion material launched in 2019. Nourished by rainwater, the plant’s leaves are cut just twice a year, while no toxic chemicals are used in manufacture.

Vegea (Italy): Grape skins, seeds and stalks discarded during wine production have been used by this company to make vegetal leather since 2016. Its website states that no toxic solvents or heavy metals are involved in its processes.

Malai (India): This company collects coconut water discarded by processing plants that use only the white flesh from the tropical fruit. This natural liquid, once disposed of in the local sewage system, causing destructive soil acidification, is now sterilized and serves as food for a bacterial culture. This growth process results in a sheet of cellulose jelly, which is later reinforced with natural fibers and resinous ingredients, making a product similar to leather. Yarns and molded fashions :

Alga-Life (Germany): Founded in 2016, this firm makes threads and textile dyes by purifying proteins from algae, which are then blended with natural ingredients such as pomegranate rind and juniper needles. The system only needs sunlight and water to operate, and the process creates no waste.

MycoTEX (Netherlands): NEFFA makes customized clothing by growing a compostable mycelium textile, which, once harvested, can be shaped within a 3D mold into finished apparel. Once dry, the garment is ready to wear, having eliminated multiple traditional manufacturing steps such as the spinning of yarns and weaving of cloth. The process uses only 0.5% of the water consumed in conventional cotton production. Animal-free wool :

WOOCOA (Colombia): A group of students from the University of the Andes, in Bogotá, developed a substitute for wool that is 100% biodegradable, winning the 2018 Biodesign Stella McCartney and PETA Prize for Animal-Free Wool. They used coconut and hemp fibers, treated with enzymes extracted from oyster mushrooms, to create a bio-based regenerative animal-free wool.

Consumers driving sustainable fashion movement

As with any business, it is consumer demand and profits that are driving the conversion from wild and domestic animal-sourced fashion materials, to plant and other biologically based materials.

This seismic shift in consumer desires has become clear in recent news: For example, in 2021, after more than 25 years of partnership, the Miss New Hampshire state beauty competition in the U.S. ended its relationship with the New Hampshire Trappers Association, a promoter of wildlife trapping that long donated a fur coat to the winner.

“Former contestants spoke publicly against the obligation to accept a fur coat as part of the prize. That antiquated tradition helped perpetuate the use of body-gripping traps, which are still allowed in the state,” Kristina Snyder, an animal rights activist and co-creator of the New Hampshire Citizens Against Recreational Trapping (NHCART) website, told Mongabay.

At the international level, trendsetting Elle magazine announced in 2021 that it is banning fur from all its 45 global editions, printed and online. According to Elle senior vice president and international director Valeria Bessolo Llopiz, “[A] fur-free future is a great opportunity to increase awareness for animal welfare, bolster the demand for sustainable and innovative alternatives and foster a more humane fashion industry.”

St Patrick’s Day: Is Chicago’s green river dyeing tradition bad for the environment?,"The Chicago River is once again a Flubber-coloured shade of green in celebration of St Patrick’s Day.

Every Saturday before the Irish day of revelry on 17 March - except for the last two years of the pandemic - the river is dyed this striking hue in honour of the city’s Irish roots.

But seventy years on from the tradition being started by Chicago’s plumbers, environmental groups are increasingly keen to see the river left alone.

“Dyeing the river perpetuates the notion that it can be treated any way anyone wants, rather than protected as a valuable natural resource,” says Margaret Frisbie, executive director of Friends of the Chicago River, which has long campaigned for an end to the practice.

“Now more than ever our land and waterways need protection and our traditions need to evolve to reflect that.”

So how exactly did the eye-catching celebration evolve, and - as onlookers wonder year after year - is there an environmental cost?

Why does Chicago dye its river green?

Dyeing the Chicago River green is inextricably bound up with pollution.

When Richard J Daley became Mayor of Chicago in 1955, he was determined to clean up the city’s riverfront area - starting with the sewage-strewn river itself.

To work out where the waste was coming from, he employed local plumbers to pour an orange concoction into people’s water systems. When the solution came into contact with sewage, it turned a bright green.

Seeing a colleague’s green-soaked overalls one day reportedly gave Stephen Bailey, a representative of the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers Local union, the idea to scale up the discolouration.

As co-chair of the parade (an annual occurrence in Chicago since the 1950s) he first turned part of the river green in 1962. 100 pounds of the chemical was poured in, leaving it a neon shade for the entire week. It took a couple of years to perfect the ratio so it would only last for a day.

Though photos shared on social media today show the river still looking green from its Saturday decoration.

Is it harmful to river wildlife?

The original dye was an oil-based fluorescein, also commonly used to detect leaks. Environmentalists successfully argued that it was ecotoxic and could be doing even more damage to the river, resulting in a switch to a powdered, vegetable-based dye from 1966.

“Illinois EPA has never required a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit so there is no way to know what the dye is or whether it is harmless,” says Ms Frisbie.

But the Friends’ main objection is on grounds of disrespect to the river and its inhabitants. The water has come a long way since the badly polluted sixties, they say. “Imagine fish, beavers or otters swimming through that dyed-green water and you might think a new celebration is the right idea.”

The practice is met with some bemusement from Ireland.

There’s still considerable room for progress, however. In a video shared to Twitter, Chicago historian Shermann Dilla Thomas says, “If you know anything about the Chicago River, you know that river is polluted.”

Conservation police are also keeping an eye out for illegal dyeing, which occurred in 2020 and 2021 while the parade was called off due to Covid crowd control.

Only a stretch of the river downtown is allowed to be dyed, but last year an upper part of the water was also turned emerald green. Whoever the culprits are, “their idea of fun is ecologically harmful and against the law,” says Frisbie.",,[],[]
12 best aluminum-free deodorants for men,"I know what you’re thinking…natural, aluminum-free deodorant is synonymous with ineffective deodorant. That may have been true years ago but not anymore. The grooming industry is moving towards more natural ingredients and more sustainable products and packaging, and it’s about time.

Don’t just take our word for it; we’ve done the research and listed out the 12 best aluminum-free deodorants for men so that you don’t have to fight your way through a million different deodorants to finally find one that works. As much as we may despise it at times, our bodies were made to sweat, which is why we have pores on our body and under our arms. Not only does sweating allow our bodies to release excess heat, but it also promotes the removal of toxins from things we consume and environmental factors that affect us.

Aluminum blocks your pores which is why it’s an anti-perspirant—it literally stops sweat from excreting. While you may be thinking, “Great! I don’t want to sweat,” let us remind you that if you block the sweat from coming out, you are also locking the toxins inside which can cause major health issues such as breast cancer (yes, men can, unfortunately, get this too). Aluminum can also cause skin irritation.

This compilation of the 12 best aluminum-free deodorants for men are products that have been tried and tested, and we know they will deliver on their claims of offering odor protection and sweat prevention without using harmful ingredients.

(Blue Atlas) | Blu Atlas Deodorant

If you’re hoping to find the top-of-the-line, aluminum-free deodorant, the one that stands out against the rest, look no further than Blu Atlas deodorant. Blu Atlas stands behind this product, promising a 100%-vegan, all-natural formula.

In case you haven’t already tried their product line, Blu Atlas is a premium grooming brand, running the gamut from hair and skincare to fragrances and body care. All of their products are formulated and intended for the modern man. Your body will appreciate that each of their products are created using thoughtful, natural ingredients. But don’t let the thought of “natural” ingredients scare you into thinking they won’t be effective. Blu Atlas promises the effectiveness of their grooming line is equally as impressive as the ingredients they are created from, and they’re products are backed by a money-back guarantee.

The two main ingredients in their deodorant are coco-caprylate and bentonite (volcanic ash). Coco-caprylate is a gel that is derived from caprylic acid and coconut alcohol, and it functions as an emollient that will soften and soothe your skin. The volcanic ash has super tiny, but highly absorbent, particles. As the volcanic acid sits on your skin, it gets to work removing any excess oil from your skin or scalp, removing impurities from your skin and leaving your pores looking tighter and smaller. And the scent is fresh and citrusy in nature.

Ultimately, if you choose this powerful deodorant, you will be left with softer skin, less oil and sweat, and you’ll smell fresh all day long. If it becomes your new deodorant staple, Blu Atlas offers a subscription service that will not only save you 20%, but will also deliver every 30 days so that you’ll never have to worry about running out. Purchase directly from the Blu Atlas website.

Grown Alchemist is a brand trying to make those golden products. This emerging brand makes products that are compatible with human biology, using a holistic approach by using knowledge of nutrition, genetics, dermatology, and pharmacology to optimize the health of their consumers.

Icelandic moss extract polysaccharides start off the bioactive ingredient list, neutralizing odors through antifungal and anti-bacterial properties that also soothe irritated skin. The sage-complex unique to Grown Alchemist helps to eliminate any unwanted body odor through employing anti-microbial properties.

Glycyrrhetinic Acid is a derivative of liquorice extract and is an anti-irritant agent that softens your skin while also eliminating bacteria that can cause body odor. Lastly, there are a few other active compounds, such as coumarins and triglycerides from tamanu seed oil that are anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial, helping to encourage optimum microbial skin balance.

The fragrance of moss and sage is unique and irresistible. You will be impressed by both the aroma it brings as well as its ability to keep you feeling fresh every time you put it on. And the roll-on application style makes it easy to apply as much (or as little) as you need.

9. Pretty Frank Baking Soda Free Deodorant - Charcoal Seaside

(Pretty Frank) | Baking Soda Free Deodorant - Charcoal Seaside

The Pretty Frank brand is a subsidiary of the Primal Pit Paste brand, and they have a pretty straightforward mission to take back natural. The creator of Pretty Frank was shocked to see how many brands claiming to be all-natural were really just flooded with lies and unsafe ingredients. The word “natural” casts a large net over different ingredients, and she was not comfortable with that, coining the term “naturalwashing” to refer to brands using natural ingredients in conjunction with synthetic ingredients.

Refusing to sit back and let this happen, and with a strong desire to create a product she felt comfortable letting her teenager use, the creator of Pretty Frank and Primal Pit Paste got to work educating, sharing the truth, and creating genuinely natural products.

Pretty Frank Baking Soda Free Deodorant is completely organic, natural, and made from vegan ingredients. The combination of zinc, magnesium, and charcoal work together to give you highly effective odor prevention while delivering a silky-smooth feel.

You’ll be invigorated by the fragrance of lavender, lemon, palmarosa, and juniper berry. If you have sensitive skin, this product does not have any parabens or fake fragrance, so you will reap the benefits of this deodorant without any negative side effects.

11. Milk + Honey Extra Strength Deodorant - Lavender, Tea Tree No. 09

(Milk + Honey) | Extra Strength Deodorant - Lavender, Tea Tree No. 09

One of the primary concerns when thinking of natural deodorant is that they will not mask body odor, and we understand. There are a lot of products on the market that don’t follow through with their claims. If you’re a sweaty guy, don’t fret; there are extra-strength, natural deodorants that can keep up with your needs.

One specific hard working product is Milk + Honey Extra Strength Deodorant. This deodorant is free of aluminum, cruelty, parabens, and other harmful ingredients, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not effective. Milk + Honey knows there are men out there who are convinced natural products could never work for them, and they are determined to change their minds with their hyperclean beauty and wellness products.

Based on the belief that beauty is a direct result of health and wellness, the Milk + Honey products are full of all of the good stuff, and zero of the bad stuff. Before you say anything, men are just as beautiful as women and these products are unisex for a reason.

The food grade baking soda is mined from the earth, naturally neutralizes odor and has a very fine grit that will not irritate your skin. Arrowroot powder helps with sweat as it reduces wetness in a safe way. Organic coconut oil is hydrating while organic lavender oil is included to calm and soothe both your skin and mind. Organic tea tree leaf oil rounds out the main ingredients by naturally eliminating odor causing bacteria.

The fragrance is fresh and calming. If lavender and tea tree isn’t your jam, the extra strength also comes in a Lemon + Vanilla No. 05 scent that is equally effective and smells amazing. For maximum coverage, warm the deodorant before use by pressing it up into your underarm for a second or two, and once softened, liberally apply to be covered for the remainder of the day.

12. Every Man Jack Cedarwood Deodorant

(Every Man Jack) | Cedarwood Deodorant

Like most men, Ritch Viola (the creator of Every Man Jack) was frustrated with the lack of quality men’s grooming lines. He found that the products on the market were either way too pricey, jam packed with harmful ingredients and chemically driven formulas, or both. So Ritch set out in his garage in San Francisco to create high-quality, clean grooming products that were also affordable and able to fill an empty niche in the men’s grooming realm. Within two years of Every Man Jack’s inception, it was recognized in Oprah magazine as part of her Favorite Things gift guide. If Oprah has given her stamp of approval, then what else do you need?

Twenty-five years later, Ritch remains the CEO of Every Man Jack, ensuring his initial goals are still carried out in each of his products. His dedication to Every man Jack shows through in each product that reaches store shelves.

This deodorant is one of Every Man Jack’s top sellers, providing long-lasting protection from odors and a formula that is 99% naturally derived. It is vegan, completely paraben-free, and clean. The inclusion of cotton extract and witch hazel helps to absorb any moisture and lichen extract acts as an antibacterial agent that keeps odor causing bacteria in check. The fragrance is woodsy and reminiscent of aftershave, so you can trust that you will smell great regardless of where you are or what you’re doing.

Every Man Jack products are so effective, they have become the exclusive men’s grooming products for Tough Mudder events. Once participants complete the event, they are immersed in a Every Man Jack branded shower experience. If Every Man Jack can clean those athletes off, they can certainly do the same for you.",,[],"['Grooming Playbook', 'May', 'Updated', 'June']"
175 countries commit to creating plastics pollution treaty,"The United Nation's top environmental body agreed March 2 to move forward on a global plastics pollution treaty, setting in motion talks that could have a major impact on how plastics are regulated and used around the world.

Countries will now spend two years negotiating details of the treaty, but diplomats meeting at the U.N. Environment Assembly in Kenya said their decision marked a big step toward controlling plastics pollution and putting in place stronger laws to make plastics more circular.

""The bottom line is we will eliminate plastics pollution from our environment,"" said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program. ""[We] need to bring the private sector into the room, because the private sector, after all, are the producers of plastics.""

The talks will hash out specifics like financing mechanisms for more waste collection, national targets and goals around product design.

""We need to talk about whether, and how, we measure the degree of circularity,"" Andersen said at a UNEA news conference as talks concluded. ""We'll need to have a conversation about whether we should have some goals for reduced raw polymers in the production chain.""

The UNEA decision, which was approved by delegations from nearly 200 countries participating, drew praise from both environmental groups and industry representatives in Nairobi for the talks.

Plastics groups said they liked that the broad mandate of the U.N.'s framework document guiding the talks gives flexibility to countries on how they implement the treaty.

The International Council of Chemical Associations, which includes the American Chemistry Council, said in a statement that it was pleased with the outcome of the UNEA meeting and supports a legally binding treaty.

It said it appreciated governments for ""highlighting the significant role plastics play in society.""",,[],"['Steve Toloken', 'Assistant Managing Editor']"
Pangaia scales bacteria-based dye approach,"LONDON – Apparel brand Pangaia has released a new capsule collection of tracksuits featuring bio-synthesised colorants from Colorifix – a company that was originally spun out of the University of Cambridge.

In what is said to be the first commercially available application of this new lab-grown dye approach, the capsule collection is dyed with two blue and pink pigments derived from bacteria. One microbe is found naturally in and around colourful geysers while the other colonises silk production waste.

Colorifix has gone from making a single bio-synthetic dye in a pilot process to a full palette of colours that can be applied at scale using standard dyeing equipment.",,[],"['Simon Glover', 'Friday', 'Thursday', 'Wednesday', 'Monday']"
