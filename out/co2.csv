Recorded atmospheric CO2 hits new record,"It may sound like a small number, 421 parts per million is a huge number when you’re talking about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And it’s now the highest recorded global CO2 level, reached in May of this year.

Andrew Freedman wrote about this for the Axios Generate newsletter. He said what’s more concerning than the record itself, is the pace at which CO2 is increasing.

“If you look through Earth’s geological history, coming out of the Ice Age we really only raised CO2 by about 80 ppm over 6,000 years,” he told Climate Cast host Paul Huttner. “But we’re going up by about two to four ppm every year. The head official for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who tracks this says this is an explosion of CO2 when you look at this from an historical perspective.”

Earth’s CO2 level passes a new climate milestone,"The atmospheric CO2 level in May was 50 percent higher than during the pre-industrial era, raising fears about climate change.

Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in May were 50 percent higher than during the pre-industrial era, reaching levels not seen on Earth for about four million years, the main US climate agency said on Friday.

The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed the threshold of 420 parts per million (ppm), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said. PPM is a unit of measurement used to quantify pollution in the atmosphere.

Last May, the rate was 419ppm, and in 2020, 417ppm.

Global warming caused by humans, particularly through the production of electricity using fossil fuels, transport, the production of cement, or even deforestation, is responsible for the new high, the NOAA said.

CO2 is a greenhouse gas that traps heat, gradually causing global warming. It remains in the atmosphere and oceans for thousands of years.

Its warming effect is already causing dramatic consequences, noted NOAA, including the multiplication of heatwaves, droughts, fires or floods.

“Carbon dioxide is at levels our species has never experienced before – this is not new,” said Pieter Tans, a scientist with the Global Monitoring Laboratory at NOAA.

“We have known about this for half a century, and have failed to do anything meaningful about it. What’s it going to take for us to wake up?”

Before the Industrial Revolution

The measurements are taken at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, ideally located high on a volcano, which allows it to escape the possible influence of local pollution.

Before the Industrial Revolution, levels of CO2 held steady at about 280ppm, a level maintained for approximately 6,000 years of human civilisation that preceded industrialisation, according to NOAA.

The level now is comparable to what it was between 4.1 and 4.5 million years ago, when CO2 levels were near or above 400ppm, the NOAA said.

At that time, sea levels were between five and 25 metres higher than now, high enough to submerge many of today’s major cities. Large forests also occupied parts of the Arctic, according to studies.

“The science is irrefutable: humans are altering our climate in ways that our economy and our infrastructure must adapt to,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad was quoted as saying by the climate agency website.",,[],[]
Could steam-powered cars decrease the CO2 in the atmosphere?,"Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskidsus@theconversation.com.

Could steam-powered cars decrease the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere? – Emma, age 16, Springville, Utah

With the growing severity and frequency of storms, heat waves and wildfires, and the other dangers from climate change, there are many reasons to be concerned about the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Scientists have shown that humanity’s addiction to burning fossil fuels is causing this problem, which means it’s time to kick that habit.

Because transportation generates more than one-fourth of the CO2 emitted by burning fossil fuels, slashing CO2 emissions requires phasing out vehicles powered by gasoline, diesel and natural gas.

Steam powered many of the early automobiles sold around 1900. Could the same technology play a role again?

The ‘Stanley Steamer’

The steam-powered car became possible once gasoline and diesel oil replaced wood and coal for the powering of engines.

Inventors Francis and Freelan Stanley, twin brothers, became automaking pioneers after they improved photographic technology. In 1898 and 1899 they were selling more vehicles than any other early automaker, and their steam-powered “Rocket Racer” set a speed record in 1906.

All along, cars powered by internal combustion engines – the kind most in use today – were competing with steam cars and winning the technology war. Starting in 1912, electric starters made them safer and more convenient by replacing dangerous hand cranks. By 1920, when its assembly lines started producing the Model T with an electric starter, Ford was selling hundreds of thousands of cars per year.

In contrast, early steam cars were heavy and expensive, and it took a long time to make enough steam to get them rolling. Doble Steam Motors, another early automaker, eventually solved this last problem and many others, but the cars remained pricey, and it was too late: The noisy and polluting but much cheaper internal combustion engine had won out. The Stanley Motor Carriage Co. ceased operating in 1924.

To be clear, because the heat to boil water to make steam has to come from somewhere, these steam-powered vehicles burned fossil fuels to heat their water anyway.

A 1970s comeback

Steam power had something of a comeback in the 1970s, but not because of climate concerns. Back then, air pollution spewed by vehicles had become a serious problem filling cities with smog.

Steam boilers can burn fuel more thoroughly than a standard internal combustion engine, leading to cleaner exhaust that is mostly water and carbon dioxide.

At the time, that was seen as an improvement.

Some of the cities battling pollution from automobile exhaust added steam-powered buses to their fleets. This resurgence was short-lived because of the arrival of new technologies that could curb pollution from internal combustion engines.

Steam’s drawback and electricity’s advantages

The biggest obstacle for steam-powered vehicles is that steam isn’t a source of energy. Rather, it is a source of power for the wheels.

While getting around in steam-powered vehicles might make the air cleaner in the drivers’ own communities, switching to steam-powered engines that continue to burn gasoline and diesel wouldn’t reduce CO2 emissions.

A different approach can potentially eliminate the need to burn fossil fuels for transportation: replacing gasoline tanks with batteries to provide the energy, along with swapping out internal combustion engines for electric motors to turn the wheels.

The reduction in carbon emissions will be far greater if vehicles run on electricity generated by wind turbines, solar panels or other energy sources that don’t emit carbon dioxide.

As it happens, some of the first cars ever made were electric. Manufacturers stopped making those models because the need to recharge their batteries after short distances rendered those vehicles less convenient than those powered by fossil fuels.

Battery technology is so much better now that some electric vehicles can travel 400 miles (640 kilometers) without needing to recharge. Instead of switching to steam as a source of power to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, we recommend electricity generated from renewable sources.

I took a CO2 detector on a flight: It showed me when I was most likely exposed to COVID,"I took a CO2 detector on a flight: It showed me when I was most likely exposed to COVID

DENVER – On seat 10D, my eyes flicker between my fellow passengers crammed in the aisle and the carbon dioxide detector balanced on my knee.

I can't help but shudder a little every time someone coughs or sneezes as they board, and the numbers on the detector climb steadily, from about 800 parts per million to more than 1,600 ppm.

Experts say that the level of carbon dioxide in indoor air is an easy proxy for potential COVID-19 exposure, and now that masks are voluntary on planes and international arrivals no longer have to test, I wanted to see what my potential risk was.

Outdoor air typically has less than 400 ppm of carbon dioxide, and although the levels of CO2 on my plane never reach anything near what's considered even mildly unhealthy, the numbers suggest I'm being exposed to coronavirus. I can't help but touch my mask for reassurance.

Aboard one of the last masked flights: Here's how crew, passengers found out masks weren't required

International travel: US to drop COVID-19 testing requirement for international flyers Sunday

I'm wearing a mask on this flight to visit my elderly parents in Vermont. The last time I visited, I was on one of the last mandatory masked flights, and I've taken several flights since then, sometimes masked, sometimes not.

Nationally, about 300 people a day are still dying of COVID-19. While rapid tests are now widely available, they only measure whether you're infected. There's no way to know about the people around you – especially when many people don't seem to care whether they're infected, or what the consequences could be for my parents or other at-risk communities.

That's where the CO2 detector comes in. I bought a $140 KOPUO tester from Amazon, which an expert later tells me is one of the cheapest but still accurate detectors. Cheaper ones use a different measuring system that can be inaccurate if there's a lot of hand sanitizer being used around it.

Why measure CO2?

An area with high CO2 levels may put you at higher risk for infection, while a space with low CO2 levels can be considered safer, says University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jose-Luis Jimenez.

Jimenez is an expert on how particles and gases move around a room, and he's tested lots of inexpensive CO2 detectors and found that many are remarkably accurate compared to laboratory-grade equipment.

""It's the only thing that we have found that approximates having this information,"" Jimenez said. ""It's not perfect, because everyone exhales carbon dioxide, but not everyone who exhales has COVID.""

Jimenez and his colleagues found that in a library, if an influx of people makes CO2 levels double from 800 ppm to 1,600, COVID-19 transmission risk triples. And if CO2 levels in a gym drop from 2,800 ppm to 1,000, the risk of COVID-19 transmission drops 75%.

There are of course caveats to his models, particularly when it comes to masks, airplanes and HEPA filters. HEPA stands for ""high-efficiency particulate air"" and most large airplanes made by Boeing and Airbus have them installed. HEPA filters are effective at removing dust, pollen, bacteria and virus particles from the air, but they don't remove carbon dioxide because it's a dissolved gas with far smaller molecules.

Are filters enough to prevent COVID on airplanes?: Airlines say mask mandates aren't needed anymore

Multiple studies conducted by the federal government, airlines, aircraft manufacturers and other researchers have concluded air travel poses a relatively low risk of COVID-19 infection, in large part because the HEPA filters remove virus particles. But that's relevant only when the aircraft is pumping air through the filters. Airbus says its systems completely replace cabin air every 2-3 minutes while flying.

Measuring CO2 levels on my flight, at the airport

My measurements show CO2 levels skyrocketed during boarding of my Airbus A319 headed to Vermont, but remained virtually unchanged on my flight back to Denver. That indicates the pilot or ground crew were doing something different at boarding that kept the air fresher, even though both flights were similarly full and I was seated in almost the same place on both directions.

United Airlines did not respond to a request for comment on its specific policies, but sent a statement saying, in part, ""There is always fresh air on the aircraft. The primary HEPA benefits are when airborne, because significant outdoor air is circulated through the cabin and jet bridge on the ground anyway.""

In the Denver International Airport terminal, the CO2 levels remained relatively consistent at about 800 ppm, and I felt comfortable removing my mask to wolf down some McDonald's hash browns. The levels hit about 1,000 ppm on the airport train to the concourse, but sitting at the gate I was actually more concerned with how few men had washed their hands after using the restroom. That thought also made me shudder.

Aboard the plane, CO2 levels hit 1,520 ppm when flight attendants closed the boarding door, rose to about 1,800 when the pilot appeared to turn on a different ventilation system, dropped to about 1,600 as we taxied to the runway, and then jumped back to 1,900 as we approached the end of the runway for takeoff.

The levels began dropping immediately as the engines spooled up, and then leveled off around 1,200 as the seatbelt sign came off at 28,000 feet.

Watching the monitor, the levels rose back up to 1,550 as the flight attendants (one masked, one not) distributed cookies and then stayed at about that level until we landed. After getting off the plane in Burlington, the CO2 level was about 1,000 in the terminal, and I finally removed by mask.

Risk assessment

Returning home on Monday, the CO2 in the airport was about 400 ppm, which is the same level it was outside. The Burlington airport is far smaller than Denver's, and fewer people were wearing masks, including me. The CO2 levels for the return flight topped out at about 1,000 ppm as the boarding door closed, and it dropped to about 850 at takeoff and remained there until we touched down in Denver.

Riding the train back from the concourse to the terminal, the CO2 level touched 650, significantly lower than my outbound ride. Given those lower levels, I felt reassured that leaving my mask off was a safe bet.

Jimenez said my behavior follows what's known as a ""budget of risk"" – by using data, I adjusted my responses. Jimenez said he still wears N-95 masks on planes and tries to eat beforehand if it's a short flight, but otherwise has to take it off when eating onboard. He said carrying around a CO2 detector has helped him make informed decisions about possible COVID-19 exposure.

""We are all being forced to do that,"" he said of the constant decisions about risk. ""We don't want to live like monks.""

For me, the detector is an easy form of reassurance about my relative risks: Indoor areas with high levels of CO2 will prompt me to wear a mask, while areas with lower levels mean I can skip it.

Going forward, the proof will be in the pudding, as my parents like to say. And in this case, it means yet another negative COVID-19 test result upon my return to Denver.",,[],['Trevor Hughes']
Fact Check-Volcanoes do not produce more CO2 emissions than human activity,"An eruption of Italy’s Mt. Etna, Europe’s highest and most active volcano, does not produce “10,000 times” more carbon dioxide (CO2) than “mankind has in our entire time on earth”. Contrary to a years-old meme containing this false statement, the combined activity of all volcanoes on earth is actually estimated to be a fraction of the CO2 emitted by human activity.

The meme reads: “That one little burp by Mt. Etna has already put more than 10,000 times the CO2 into the atmosphere than mankind has in our ENTIRE time on earth but don’t worry a scam is in the works to tax you your minuscule footprint.”

The same allegation has been shared since at least 2016 ( here ) ( here ). More recent examples are viewable ( here ) ( here ) ( here ).

An iteration posted on Twitter on June 2, 2022 has been retweeted nearly 9,000 times as of the writing of this article ( here ).

In an email to Reuters, Boris Behncke, vulcanologist at the Etna Observatory of Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) ( here ) described the meme as “complete nonsense” and “misinformation”.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey ( here ), published scientific estimates of the global CO2 emissions for all on land and submarine volcanos “lie in a range from 0.13 gigaton to 0.44 gigaton per year.”

This is a fraction of the CO2 produced by human activity. In 2021, the global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes alone reached a record high of 36.3 billion tonnes (or gigatons, GT), data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) showed ( here ). A graph by the IEA tracking the increase of emissions since 1899 is viewable ( here )

“On a global level, volcanoes currently emit just a few percent of the man-made CO2 production,” Bechkne said, highlighting that CO2 emissions of human activity have dramatically increased in the past decades, while volcanic emissions have not.

Simon Carn, Professor of Geological and Mining Engineering and Sciences at Michigan Technological University, concurred and said the best estimates for Mt. Etna’s volcanic CO2 emissions are at “~3 million tons per year.” “Hence Etna’s CO2 emissions are roughly ~0.01% of anthropogenic emissions in a typical year. A single eruption of Etna would emit much less CO2, and so the percentage would be even smaller.”

Large eruptions can indeed emit significant amounts of CO2, but these events are rare and are still small when compared with human emissions ( here ).

The largest volcanic eruptions in recent history emitted approximately 10-50 million tons of carbon dioxide, Carn told Reuters in 2020, while addressing a similar allegation ( here ).

Fact-checkers at the AFP, AAP and Climate Feedback have previously debunked the meme about Mt. Etna as well ( here ) ( here ) ( here )

VERDICT

False. Volcanoes are estimated to produce a fraction of the CO2 emitted by human activity.

The world’s first CO2 battery for long-duration energy storage is ready for global launch,"Italian startup Energy Dome today announced the launch of the world’s first CO2 battery in Sardinia, Italy. The battery uses carbon dioxide to store renewable energy on the grid, and Energy Dome says the technology can be quickly deployed anywhere in the world.

World’s first CO2 battery

Energy Dome sited the CO2 Battery in Sardinia to favor speed to market and ease of execution, as it’s in an industrial area with an existing electrical connection. Further, Sardinia currently uses coal, but the fossil fuel will be phased out by 2025. The battery can be paired with both wind and solar.

Energy Dome began its operations in February 2020 and has progressed from a concept to full testing at multimegawatt scale in just over two years.

Energy Dome Founder and CEO Claudio Spadacini said:

The CO2 Battery is now commercially available to make cost-effective renewable energy dispatchable on a global scale.

Energy Dome asserted that its CO2 Battery facility in Sardinia uses off-the-shelf equipment available from a globally established supply chain, and said that rapid global deployment of the CO2 Battery is now possible without bottlenecks.

The company has secured multiple commercial agreements, including one with Italian utility A2A for the construction of the first 20 MW-5h facility. Earlier this year, Energy Dome also signed a nonexclusive license agreement with Ansaldo Energia, a power generation plant and component provider, to build long-duration energy storage projects in Italy, Germany, the Middle East, and Africa.

Energy Dome’s plan is backed by investors that include European deep tech venture capital firm 360 Capital, Barclays, Novum Capital Partners, and Third Derivative.

How the CO2 Battery works

CO2 is one of the few gases that can be condensed and stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temperature, so, as Energy Dome states on its website, it’s the perfect fluid to store energy cost-effectively in a closed thermodynamic process. It allows for high-density energy storage without the need to go to extremely low temperatures.

Spadacini explained how it works to Bloomberg in May:

To charge the battery, we take CO2 at near atmospheric temperature and pressure and we compress it. The heat that is generated during compression is stored. When we exchange the thermal energy with the atmosphere, the CO2 gas becomes liquid. To generate and dispatch electricity, the liquid CO2 is heated up and converted back into a gas that powers a turbine, which generates power. The CO2 gas is always contained and the entire system is sealed. We don’t use any exotic materials. The technology uses steel, CO2 and water. So there is no dependency on rare earth materials like cobalt or lithium. This makes our technology geopolitically independent. It can be produced everywhere and it can be used everywhere.

Energy Dome made a short video last year demonstrating how its CO2 energy storage works:

Electrek’s Take

This is certainly one to watch, as a CO2 battery doesn’t use rare earth materials, and that’s a very big deal. It seems cost-effective and downright democratic. This battery has great potential, and we look forward to seeing whether it deploys quickly on a global scale.

"Lights, Catalyst, Reaction! Photoreduction of CO2 Into Transportable Fuel","Converting CO2 to Formic Acid Using an Alumina-Supported, Iron-Based Compound

Photoreduction of CO 2 into transportable fuel like formic acid (HCOOH) is a great way of dealing with CO 2 ’s rising levels in the atmosphere. To aid in this mission, a research team from Tokyo Tech chose an easily available iron-based mineral and loaded it onto an alumina support to develop a catalyst that can efficiently convert CO 2 into HCOOH with ~90% selectivity!

Electric vehicles are an attractive option for many, and a key reason why is their lack of carbon emissions. However, a big drawback for many is their lack of range and long charging times. That’s where liquid fuels like gasoline have a big advantage. Their high energy density means a long range, and it is fast to refuel.

Switching to a different liquid fuel from gasoline or diesel can eliminate carbon emissions while retaining the advantages of liquid fuel. For example, in a fuel cell formic can power the engine while releasing water and CO 2 . However, if the formic acid is created by reducing atmospheric CO 2 into HCOOH, the only net output is water.

The rising CO 2 levels in our atmosphere and their contribution to global warming is now common news. As researchers experiment with different ways to battle this problem, one efficient solution has emerged—converting excess atmospheric CO 2 into energy-rich chemicals.

Production of fuels like formic acid (HCOOH) by photoreduction of CO 2 under sunlight has attracted a lot of attention recently due to the two-fold benefit that can be gained from this process: it can reduce excess CO 2 emissions, and also help minimize the energy shortage we are currently facing. Being an excellent carrier of hydrogen with high energy density, HCOOH can provide energy via combustion while releasing only water as a byproduct.

To turn this lucrative solution into reality, scientists developed photocatalytic systems that could reduce CO 2 with the aid of sunlight. Such a system consists of a light-absorbing substrate (i.e., a photosensitizer) and a catalyst that can enable the multi-electron transfers required to reduce CO 2 into HCOOH. And thus began the search for a suitable and efficient catalyst!

Solid catalysts were deemed the best candidates for this task, due to their efficiency and potential recyclability, and over the years, catalytic abilities of many cobalt, manganese, nickel, and iron-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been explored, with the latter having some advantages over other metals. However,, most of the iron-based catalysts reported thus far only yield carbon monoxide as the main product, instead of HCOOH.

This problem, nevertheless, was soon solved by a team of researchers from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) led by Prof. Kazuhiko Maeda. In a recent study published in the chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie, the team presented an alumina (Al 2 O 3 )-supported, iron-based catalyst that uses alpha-iron(III) oxyhydroxide (α-FeOOH; geothite). The new α-FeOOH/Al 2 O 3 catalyst showed superior CO­ 2 to HCOOH conversion properties alongside excellent recyclability. When asked about their choice of catalyst, Prof. Maeda says, “We wanted to explore more abundant elements as catalysts in a CO 2 photoreduction system. We need a solid catalyst that is active, recyclable, non-toxic, and inexpensive, which is why we chose a widespread soil mineral like goethite for our experiments.”

The team adopted a simple impregnation method to synthesize their catalyst. They then used the iron-loaded Al 2 O 3 material for photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 at room temperature in the presence of a ruthenium-based (Ru) photosensitizer, an electron donor, and visible light of wavelength over 400 nanometers.

The results were quite encouraging; their system showed 80-90% selectivity towards the main product, HCOOH, and a quantum yield of 4.3% (which indicates the system’s efficiency).

This study presents a first-of-its-kind, iron-based solid catalyst that can generate HCOOH when accompanied by an effective photosensitizer. It also explores the importance of a proper support material (Al 2 O 3 ) and its effect on the photochemical reduction reaction.

The insights from this research could aid in the development of new catalysts—free of precious metals—for the photoreduction of CO 2 into other useful chemicals. “Our study shows that the road to a greener energy economy doesn’t have to be complicated. Great results can be attained even by adopting simple catalyst preparation methods and well known, earth-abundant compounds can be used as selective catalysts for CO 2 reduction, if they are supported by compounds like alumina,” concludes Prof. Maeda.",,[],['Tokyo Institute Of Technology']
What if CO2 emissions stopped today? A study offers answers,"Over the years, scientists have raised a key question about future climate change: When, exactly, does the warming stop?

Do temperatures stop rising as soon as people cease emitting greenhouse gases? Or is some level of future warming already guaranteed, or “locked in,” by our past emissions?

Recent studies generally suggest good news on that front. The vast majority of future warming depends on future emissions. There shouldn’t be much future warming locked in from the past.

Advertisement

Now, a new study suggests that’s mostly true — but with some caveats. It’s important to look at all kinds of human emissions in the atmosphere, the research suggests, not just the main greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.

When accounting for all of them, there may be a brief give-and-take before global temperatures finally stabilize. Global temperatures could continue to rise for a few years, or a few decades, after all emissions stop, and then they may fall back down again as the climate system stabilizes.

That means past a certain point, the world may not be able to avoid temporarily overshooting the Paris Agreement’s temperature targets.

In fact, the study suggests that even if all emissions halted today, the planet would still have around a 42 percent chance of overshooting the target of 1.5 degrees Celsius, even if temperatures later dropped back below it.

Still, the study emphasizes, it remains true that the vast majority of future warming depends on future emissions. And the faster those emissions spiral down to zero, the less warming there will be.

The study, released yesterday in the journal Nature Climate Change, used a specialized model to investigate how the Earth’s climate system would respond if emissions were to suddenly stop.

The study looked at a range of possible future climate scenarios assuming different levels of emissions, some higher, some lower. For each possible scenario, the researchers examined a series of hypothetical stop dates — the point at which emissions suddenly vanish — between now and 2080.

The study makes a point of accounting for a wide variety of different human-caused emissions, not just the heavy hitters like carbon dioxide and methane.

That’s important, the authors say, because some kinds of emissions actually have a cooling effect on the planet — and as a result, they’re masking a small portion of the warming that’s being caused by greenhouse gases. That means when these emissions vanish, this masking effect will also stop, and temperatures may temporarily rise beyond what might be expected when considering greenhouse gases alone.

Certain types of air pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels are a prime example. Some of these particles are highly reflective and help beam sunlight away from the Earth, slightly cooling the climate. If the planet stops burning fossil fuels, some of these pollutants will also disappear, taking their small masking effect with them.

In the short term, the researchers suggest, this means that global temperatures may actually rise slightly for a few years after all emissions halt. If emissions suddenly stopped today, for instance, the study suggests that the planet may continue to warm by a few tenths of a degree for several years.

Later, some of this effect is likely to reverse itself. Temperatures may begin to fall again as certain types of potent but short-lived greenhouse gases — like methane — begin to disappear from the atmosphere over time.

That’s where the concept of overshoot comes in.

The study finds that there’s a 42 percent chance of overshooting the 1.5 C target even if emissions stopped today. At the same time, there are much lower odds of the Earth’s final temperature stabilizing above 1.5 C — probably around 5 percent or so.

And the 2 C target still remains firmly in reach at this point. The study estimates only about a 2 percent chance of overshoot if emissions halted immediately, and zero odds that the Earth’s stable temperature would exceed 2 C in the long run.

Far more important to the fate of the planet, the study says, is what happens in the next few years.

The risk of overshoot rises substantially the longer humans continue emitting greenhouse gases. The study estimates that the risk of exceeding the 1.5 C target rises to 66 percent by 2029, assuming moderate emissions over the next few years.

And the risk of permanently overshooting the temperature targets also rises dramatically the longer emissions are released.

The research has a few important caveats. On one hand, it assumes that human-caused emissions suddenly stop all at once. That’s not how it would work in the real world, and changes in the Earth’s temperatures may be different in real life.

On the other hand, the study doesn’t account for certain kinds of potential climate feedbacks that could speed up future warming — things like thawing permafrost and rapid ice loss. That means that some of its estimates of future warming could be on the conservative side.

The study’s general warning, however, is clear. And it echoes the warnings issued in the newest reports from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Meeting the Paris targets is only possible with immediate and dramatic reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. And even then, the 1.5 C target is rapidly closing in.

The latest IPCC reports also warn the world not to underestimate the dangers of overshooting global temperature goals. Even if they later stabilize below 1.5 or 2 C, some climate impacts can’t be so easily reversed. Certain types of damage to glaciers and ice sheets, global sea-level rise, and the extinction of plant and animal species, for instance, are essentially permanent on human time scales.

At the same time, multiple recent studies have warned that current global climate policies are still not enough to put the world on track to meet the Paris climate goals.

Dutch CO2 emissions down 11%; Aviation emissions rising,"Dutch emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses were about 11 percent lower in the first quarter of this year than in the same period last year. Statistics Netherlands (CBS) and the RIVM calculated that emissions decreased in most sectors, except for aviation and international shipping. If these two sectors and emissions from biomass-firing are included, emissions decreased by 9.9 percent.

In aviation, emissions rose by a massive 49 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021. Airlines are flying more again after a deep dip during the coronavirus pandemic.

The transport sector as a whole emitted 13.5 percent more carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase is offset by decreased emissions from the electricity sector, industry, agriculture, and the built environment. The main reason for the decrease is lower natural gas consumption.

The high natural gas prices played a role, but the first quarter of 2022 was also relatively warmer than the same quarter in 2021. ""The latter mainly has a dampening effect on the natural gas consumption in the built-up environment."" This category includes homes and offices. High energy prices also lowered consumption, according to CBS.

More and more electricity is generated from sustainable sources like the sun and wind. But more coal was burned at the beginning of this year. Overall emissions from electricity production fell by 14 percent.

The Netherlands also used more petrol (plus 4 percent) and diesel (plus 8 percent) in the first quarter of this year than in the first three months of 2021. But the total emissions from mobility are still lower than before the pandemic.

CBS pointed out that the economy has grown strongly. The gross domestic product increased by 7 percent compared to the first quarter of last year. Therefore, economic growth and more CO2 emissions do not have to go hand in hand. “Production was significantly higher for almost all sectors of the economy, while CO2 emissions were lower,” CBS summarized.",,[],[]
Recapturing CO2: It’s a Gas,"Do you know where the bubbles in your beer come from? It may not be exactly where you think.

Yeast, of course, produces the carbon dioxide (CO2) along with ethanol and all those tasty esters and phenols. However, only a small percentage of craft beer contains carbon dioxide produced during its own fermentation. Most of that gas escapes into the atmosphere, bubbling away in blow-off buckets and adding to greenhouse-gas emissions. Most canned, bottled, and kegged beer is force-carbonated and packaged with bulk CO2, which local suppliers deliver to the brewery at regular intervals.

Busy breweries tend to operate like machines, and using CO2 from bulk suppliers is one of those cogs in the machine that just works. Few give much thought to all that gas produced by the yeast. It just bubbles out into the atmosphere because it’s easy and relatively cheap to purchase CO2 from a third party. After all, gas is gas. Right?

Seen in a different light, it’s the kind of absurd inefficiency in the system that would make Rube Goldberg proud. Instead of using everything the yeast creates, a brewer discards hundreds of pounds of CO2 as a by-product of each fermentation—only to turn around and buy someone else’s by-product.

Because that’s where all that bulk CO2 comes from: It’s a by-product of other industries. In much of the United States, bulk CO2 comes from the process that turns corn into ethanol fuel. Natural-gas mining and the refining of petroleum account for another big chunk of it, while in the United Kingdom most CO2 comes from fertilizer production. While it’s true that a CO2 molecule is a CO2 molecule whether it came from a brewery or a fertilizer plant, it isn’t that simple when we talk about getting that gas into a beer.

Carbon Dioxide Recapture

How can breweries harness the full potential of fermentation and close that loop? The biggest roadblock for a small brewery using the CO2 it produces is mainly one of process.

It’s certainly possible to naturally carbonate beer—even draft beer. In Germany, where adding external CO2 runs afoul of the beer purity laws, natural carbonation is achieved with a spunding valve during fermentation (see “Gearhead: The Force Behind the Fizz,” beerandbrewing.com). Interest in spunding among American brewers appears to be rising alongside that of traditional lager, and it’s something that even homebrewers can do.

For larger breweries making hundreds of thousands of barrels a year, CO2 recapture systems are more common—and they are an example of how, even when it comes to sustainability, economies of scale favor the giants with processes and purchasing power unavailable to smaller breweries. CO2 recapture systems are seven-figure capital investments offered by the likes of GEA and Atlas Copco. They require hundreds of square feet of space and dedicated operators to keep them running. When you weigh that against the ease and affordability of bulk CO2, it’s an easy decision to rely on bulk gas.

However, as sustainability practices gain traction among independent brewers and the focus on CO2 emissions intensifies, more brewers are looking for ways to use the gas they already make. The problem: Until recently, there wasn’t an economically feasible solution for a brewery making less than 100,000 barrels annually.

Perhaps the first craft brewery to implement a CO2 recapture system was Alaskan in Juneau. The remoteness of the brewery meant that bulk CO2 was much more expensive than in the Lower 48. As cofounder Marcy Larson says, “Where we are drives what we do.” The brewery added the CO2 recapture capability with a solution offered by the Gemany-based Pentair back in the 1990s. Larson says she’s surprised the technology hasn’t caught on more widely among other craft brewers.

Across some 3,000 miles of Pacific Ocean on the island of Maui, another brewer is using a similar recapture plant from Pentair. Maui Brewing is an industry leader in sustainability initiatives, from water-use reductions to solar power to CO2 recapture. And while the positive environmental aspects of the efforts are primary, there are other considerations at play.

“Maui has a shitty electrical grid,” says Garret Marrero, the brewery’s cofounder and CEO. With the abundant sunshine in the tropics, solar power was an easy call to make. A sizeable array of panels and Tesla Powerpack batteries comprise the brewery’s “microgrid,” which is now almost independent from Maui’s electrical utility.

Hawaii also is one of the most expensive CO2 markets in the country, and that cost has doubled in Maui’s 16 years of brewing. Limited local production also means shortages and short-term price increases are not uncommon. That cost and volatility drove Marrero to look into CO2 recapture systems. He began to work with Pentair, which was developing their Haffmans CO2mpactBrew recovery system.

With a footprint of a 40-foot shipping container, the Haffmans system has offset Maui Brewing’s CO2 requirements but hasn’t completely replaced the need for bulk CO2 deliveries. The system is complex, requires regular maintenance, is prone to downtime, and can collect gas only from a subset of the brewery’s fermentations. “It can be frustrating at times, but we knew what we were getting into,” Marrero says about being an early adopter of the tech, “and we feel that it’s our duty to do more with less.”

The potential cost savings, independence from local suppliers, and direct reduction of CO2 emissions all combined to make CO2 recapture a worthwhile project for Maui Brewing.

As I was talking to Marrero, he mentioned that he was actually in Wyoming on his way to Roadhouse Brewing in Jackson Hole for a collaboration. He also mentioned their smaller-scale CO2 recapture system from Earthly Labs.

Recapture Solutions for Smaller Breweries

When I started my investigation into how craft breweries were approaching CO2 recapture, I expected an assortment of available technologies and solutions. The reality is that the low cost and wide availability of bulk CO2 meant that not many brewers were willing to invest in recapture equipment, while manufacturers were focused on the largest craft breweries.

Earthly Labs aims to change that.

Founded in 2016 in Texas on the back of proprietary technology that purifies and dehydrates captured gas then compresses it for storage, Earthly Labs has pushed to get their plug-and-play recapture system—dubbed the CiCi—into as many craft breweries as possible. They began with the local market in Austin and are now expanding to other beer hotspots around the country.

Jon Courtois, production manager at Roadhouse in Jackson Hole, was eager to talk about his experience with Earthly Labs and the CiCi system that’s installed at the Roadhouse production brewery. “It’s a no-brainer solution,” he says, “And it didn’t take a lot to convince the brewery leadership.”

ADVERTISEMENT

From the outset, cofounders Colby Cox and Gavin Fine set up Roadhouse with a commitment to sustainability and respect for the stunning natural environment that surrounds Jackson Hole. The Earthly Labs CiCi fits with that commitment while saving money and improving the safety of their brewery. They also insist that it improves the flavor of their beer.

“It’s a feather in our cap, a point of pride,” Courtois says. In an Earthly Labs informational webinar recorded recently, he estimates that the brewery will recoup the cost of the CiCi unit—about $150,000 after delivery and installation—in just three years. That’s without considering the possibility of selling any excess CO2 the brewery recaptures on the system.

The Earthly Labs system includes a few discrete components. The main unit—about the size of a commercial refrigerator—contains the dehydrator and compressor at the heart of the setup, along with an array of sensors that control the process; a pair of foam traps connected between the fermentation vessels and the CiCi prevent solids from entering the system. During active fermentation, CO2 travels through the foam traps and into the CiCi. The unit dries the gas, scrubs it of impurities, and compresses it into a storage flask for use later in the brewing process.

Courtois says the most surprising thing to him about the system wasn’t the ease of installation and setup—two days after delivery, it was up and running—nor the efficiency of capturing what was previously just a waste product. The biggest surprise, he says, was the qualitative improvements that the recaptured CO2 made to Roadhouse’s beers.

“Without question, the beer is better,” Courtois says. “You have to see it to believe it.”

Initially, the brewers and production staff were skeptical of claims that the system would improve quality. However, extensive sensory panels and analysis of both the recaptured gas and beer carbonated with it have convinced them.

The key is in the purity of the CO2 that the CiCi sequesters. While food-grade bulk CO2 is about 99.9 percent pure, that 0.1 percent of stuff that’s not carbon dioxide can include hydrocarbons, sensory-active molecules, and oxygen. That doesn’t sound like much, but in an article titled, “Understanding and Ensuring CO2 Supply Quality for Brewery Use,” the Brewers Association puts that into context: That 0.1 percent equates to 1,000 parts per million—a concentration that is one to four orders of magnitude higher than many of the flavor-active components in hops.

The biggest worry for brewers might be the trace oxygen possibly present in bulk CO2. Courtois says the recaptured CO2 from the Earthly Labs system shows single-digit O2 levels—a difference that “allows the brewer’s vision to shine with better head retention, better lacing, and a cleaner, more vivid aroma.”

A Matter of Scale

In speaking to more than a half-dozen brewers using the Earthly Labs systems or looking to add carbon-capture capabilities, the closest thing I hear to criticism of the system—beyond comments about the six-figure up-front cost—is when Kevin Brand, owner and founder of (512) Brewing in Austin, says, “I wish we could use it more.”

He says the system works best when connected to an active fermentation in one of the brewery’s 120-barrel fermentors, though 30-barrel and larger vessels also are compatible with the CiCi. “The most exciting part isn’t the money we’re saving, but the feeling we get when we’re running the system,” Brand says.

Brand was an early adopter of the CiCi in Austin, and he worked closely with Earthly Labs to iron out wrinkles in the first implementations. The CiCi’s current iteration, known as the Oak, works best at breweries that produce between 5,000 and 20,000 barrels annually.

Amy George, founder and CEO of Earthly Labs, calls it a “one-size-fits-most solution,” adding that the company is developing both smaller and larger units. Meanwhile, demand for the units is surging—along with the lead times.

Beyond the initial cost of the system, there’s a nominal operating cost as the carbon-filter medium needs to be changed regularly. (Earthly Labs includes a year of replacement medium in the up-front cost.) The compressor uses some power; George estimates that the energy required costs less than $1,500 per year. “I didn’t notice a change in our electric bill,” says Brand at (512).

Other benefits are less obvious at first glance.

At Colorado’s Denver Beer Company, the CiCi wasn’t a perfect replacement for bulk CO2, but there was enough value in the recaptured CO2 to make the system attractive.

Denver Beer produces about 25,000 barrels a year—on the high end of what the current CiCi model can handle. The brewery still uses a bulk tank to carbonate its beer. Instead of carbonating, the recaptured CO2 pushes beer through the draft systems in the brewery’s three taprooms, replacing the costly CO2 deliveries at the retail outlets. More significantly, they sell any excess recaptured CO2 to a Denver-area cannabis-growing operation.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We’re super-happy to have the CiCi,” says Denver Beer founder Patrick Crawford. “It’s a great marketing tool.”

Of course, the initial capital outlay is nothing to sneeze at. In much of the country, CO2 still costs less than 25 cents a pound, and that could push the return-on-investment past four or five years. However, many Earthly Labs’ clients have used creative financing agreements, partnerships, or government grants to soften that blow. Those clients also say that using the CO2 from their own fermentations is a value-add greater than the line item on the balance sheet.

One obvious barrier is that not many breweries can use this tech yet. Earthly Labs’ current offering is meant for breweries of a certain size. Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association, says that only 4 or 5 percent of the country’s breweries are in that range of 5,000 to 20,000 barrels a year.

However, the smaller units in development will unlock a larger chunk of the market. If the technology eventually proves cost-effective for most breweries, the days of bubbling blow-off buckets could be numbered.",,[],['John M. Verive']
Federal regulators crack down after pipeline caught spewing CO2,"Federal regulators are beginning to crack down on a new generation of pipelines that will be crucial for the Biden administration’s plans to capture millions of tons of carbon dioxide to combat climate change.

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) proposed penalties yesterday on the operator of one such pipeline that ruptured in Mississippi, sending at least 45 people to the hospital in 2020. The agency also pledged to craft new rules to prevent similar pipeline failures from happening as the US makes plans to build out a network of pipelines to transport captured CO2.

A new generation of pipelines

There are not many of these pipelines (compared to oil and gas pipelines) yet in the US, which are primarily used by the fossil fuel industry so it can shoot CO2 into oil fields to push out hard-to-reach reserves. One of those pipelines ruptured in February 2020, releasing about 30,000 barrels of liquid carbon dioxide that immediately started to vaporize and triggered the evacuation of 200 residents in and around the small town of Satartia, Mississippi. Some of those who weren’t able to leave in time were left convulsing, confused, or unconscious, according to an investigation published last year by HuffPost and the Climate Investigations Center.

Pipelines for CO2 transport the gas at high pressure and at a high enough concentration to make it an asphyxiant. The CO2 in the pipeline that ruptured was also mixed with hydrogen sulfide, but CO2 can still be harmful on its own. About 100 workers a year die from CO2 accidents globally. It’s heavier than air, allowing a plume of it to sink to the ground and blanket a large area. That can also starve vehicles of oxygen it needs to burn fuel, which can strand people trying to evacuate or authorities trying to respond to the crisis.

PHMSA proposed $3,866,734 in penalties on the operator of the pipeline that busted open in 2020, Denbury Gulf Coast Pipeline, for “probable violations.” After investigating the incident, PHMSA says that Denbury did not report to authorities “at the earliest practicable moment” after detecting the CO2 release. That hindered first responders who were left to guess what was going on after receiving reports from residents of “a green gas” in the area.

PHMSA also says that Denbury failed to conduct routine inspections and lacked written procedures “for conducting normal operations, as well as those that would allow the operator to appropriately respond to emergencies, such as guidelines for communicating with emergency responders.” Specifically, PHMSA says Denbury couldn’t provide documentation to show that it had been in touch with local officials consistently on what to do in the event of an emergency involving its pipeline.

A statement emailed to The Verge by Denbury spokesperson Brad Whitmarsh says that the company plans to improve surveillance of its pipelines to prevent future problems and “work constructively with all federal, state, and local agencies.” The 2020 rupture occurred after heavy rains in the area caused the ground to shift, stressing the pipeline, according to Whitmarsh’s email.

“The list of proposed new CO2 pipeline projects seems to grow every week”

PHMSA says it’s in the process of crafting new rules for CO2 pipelines, including requirements for how to respond to and prepare for emergencies. There is frighteningly little oversight of those pipelines, according to an assessment commissioned by the charity and advocacy group Pipeline Safety Trust that was published earlier this year.

In the meantime, PHMSA posted an advisory bulletin urging pipeline operators to plan ahead for risks posed by geohazards like those that caused the rupture near Satartia — especially as climate change leads to more extreme weather that can affect the stability of soil surrounding pipelines.

“As Denbury’s failure in Satartia, MS demonstrates, CO2 releases can be incredibly hazardous to our communities,” Pipeline Safety Trust Executive Director Bill Caram said in a press release. “The list of proposed new CO2 pipeline projects seems to grow every week, which makes it all the more important to modernize our safety regulations immediately.”

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that passed last year includes about $18 billion for projects that capture carbon dioxide from the air or from smokestack emissions. Those projects will rely on a new network of pipelines to move the greenhouse gas to places where it can be stored away, ostensibly preventing it from further heating up the planet. That means the US will have to figure out its pipeline problems if it wants to cope with climate change by capturing carbon dioxide.",,[],"['Justine Calma', 'May']"
"Poet, world's largest ethanol producer, joins Navigator CO2's $3 billion carbon capture pipeline project","Poet, world's largest ethanol producer, joins Navigator CO2's $3 billion carbon capture pipeline project

Show Caption Hide Caption Proposed Iowa pipelines: What is carbon capture and how does it work? Three companies have proposed capturing carbon dioxide from ethanol and other industrial ag plants in Iowa and sequestering it underground. Donnelle Eller and Erin Davoran, Wochit

Poet, the world's largest ethanol producer, said Tuesday it's joining Navigator CO2 Ventures' $3 billion carbon capture pipeline, one of three developers propose building through Iowa and neighboring states.

Texas-based Navigator said it will transport 5 million metric tons of liquefied carbon dioxide annually from 18 Poet plants in Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota, where the biofuels company's headquarters are located.

Elizabeth Burns-Thompson, Navigator's vice president of government and public affairs, said Tuesday the company expects to build the pipeline to Poet's plants in two phases, with the system fully operational by 2025.

Poet has 12 ethanol plants in Iowa, the state that produces the largest quantity of the biofuel. The state also grows the most U.corn, with about half its crop used to make ethanol.

“We recognize that now is the time to take bold action to preserve our planet for future generations,” Jeff Broin, Poet founder and CEO, said in a statement. ""This project is another significant step in utilizing bioprocessing to accelerate our path to net-zero.""

Navigator, Summit Carbon Solutions and Archer Daniels Midland, in partnership with Wolf Carbon Solutions, propose building pipelines across Iowa to capture carbon dioxide from ethanol, fertilizer and other industrial agriculture plants, liquefy it under pressure and transport it to locations where it will be sequestered permanently a mile underground.

Navigator and ADM plan to sequester carbon in Illinois; Ames-based Summit Carbon in North Dakota.

The projects are controversial, with hundreds of Iowa residents filing objections with state regulators, questioning whether the pipelines are needed, are safe and should be allowed to cross valuable farmland.

Kim and Ted Junker, who farm in northeast Iowa and oppose Navigator's project, said they were disappointed with Poet's decision. They said Poet employees in Shell Rock, where they sell corn, told them the company didn't plan to participate in the pipeline.

""What changed?"" said Ted Junker. ""Landowners and farmers feel like they’ve been sucker-punched.”

The companies say the projects will enable ethanol to remain viable as the nation seeks to cut net greenhouse emissions in half by 2030. By federal law, ethanol is blended into most of the nation's gasoline supply.

With the addition of Poet, Navigator said its 1,300-mile Heartland Greenway pipeline is slated to collect about 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from 33 plants across Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota and South Dakota.

MORE: Who is the Iowan behind Summit's $4.5 billion carbon capture pipeline

Navigator's pipeline will be designed to have the capacity to capture 15 million tons of carbon annually, the equivalent of removing 3.2 million vehicles from the road.

It has proposed to build 900 miles of the pipeline across 36 counties in Iowa and has conducted a series of meetings with residents in the pathway. After making some changes to the route, Navigator will be required to hold additional meetings with residents added to the pipeline's path, Burns-Thompson said.

Following those meetings, Navigator's next step will be to file a petition with the Iowa Utilities Board for a permit to build the pipeline. It also will need to request an additional permit for the second phase of the pipeline construction.

Summit Carbon Solutions already has filed a permit request for its planned $4.5 billion, 2,000-mile pipeline across Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska.

A third company, Wolf Carbon Solutions, proposes building a 350-mile pipeline serving ADM's ethanol plants in Cedar Rapids and Clinton. ADM has yet to say how much the project would cost or outline its path through Iowa.

Green Aviation Fuels Could Save 5 Million Tonnes of CO2 in 2030,"E-kerosene¹, generated by combining green hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO₂), has the potential to substantially reduce the climate impact of aviation.

Originally published on Transport & Environment.

In its new forecast, T&E has analysed the planned production capacity of 18 European e-kerosene manufacturers. By 2025, T&E finds that over 0.16 Mt of e-kerosene would be available for airlines every year. By 2030, this figure will reach over 1.83 million tonnes. This represents 3.65% of fuel demand in Europe and would save the equivalent of up to 5 Mt of CO2² — or the emissions equivalent to 30,000 transatlantic flights³.

T&E’s new analysis shows that the European e-kerosene market is ready for higher rates and faster scaling of this fuel, but that policy makers are not providing sufficient incentives to develop the production further. In order to decarbonize aviation fast and efficiently, e-kerosene needs to be made readily available for airlines to blend into their existing jet fuels.

Matteo Mirolo, aviation policy officer at T&E, said: “Green e-kerosene is the clean jet fuel of the future and must be the go-to option for airlines and policy makers alike. The opportunity for Europe is unprecedented in terms of climate impact reduction, job creation and fuel strategic autonomy. Now, it’s time for national and European legislators to drive the uptake and mandate the use of e-kerosene in aviation.”

Two conditions are essential for e-kerosene to have near zero greenhouse gas emissions and to be produced at scale. First, hydrogen needs to be produced using additional renewable electricity (so-called “green hydrogen”). Second, carbon dioxide needs to be captured from the atmosphere, a process otherwise known as direct air capture (DAC). T&E’s new analysis shows that seven out of 22 manufacturers plan to include DAC as a source of CO2.

In July 2021, the European Commission proposed new legislation called ReFuelEU, to increase the share of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in Europe. The Commission has proposed SAF-blending mandates combined with an e-kerosene fuel subtarget. Since the original proposal landed, ReFuelEU has faced heavy scrutiny. A number of EU member states have been reluctant to keep the climate ambition of the text, going as far as including unsustainable biofuel feedstocks.

The targets for e-kerosene proposed by the European Commission in its ReFuelEU proposal are too low and start too late (no mandate in 2025 and only 0.7% in 2030). T&E’s new analysis shows that an earlier and more ambitious e-kerosene mandate of at least 0.1% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2030 is possible. This should come in lieu of biofuels derived from unsustainable feedstocks.

Matteo Mirolo added: “Europe has a once in a lifetime opportunity to become the leader for green aviation through its ReFuelEU proposal. For that, policymakers have to prioritize the right type of sustainable fuels: rather than biofuels derived from unsustainable feedstocks, the EU needs to raise the game on e-kerosene.”

¹ The terms “e-fuel”, “synthetic kerosene”, “synfuels” and “power-to-liquid” are often used interchangeably. E-fuels is a broader term covering all fuels produced using electricity; e-kerosene refers to a subcategory of e-fuels suitable for aviation.

² The emissions savings are calculated using 85% of GHG savings for e-kerosene compared to fossil kerosene. As data about the commercial production of e-kerosene are not easily available, the average between the legally required minimum GHG savings for RFNBOs (70%) and the maximum (100%) is used as a proxy.

³ Emissions from a typical transatlantic flight are calculated as an average of emissions from flights between Europe and North America, using AIS data from PlaneFinder (2019) and the Eurocontrol CO2 calculator.

Analysis of green jet fuel production in Europe

Download the study.

Aircraft rely solely on fossil jet fuel to operate, leading to disastrous consequences for the planet and a dependency on imports from conflictual third countries. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) offer a promising alternative that will help reduce aviation’s emissions. The EU has proposed to increase the amount of SAFs used in aircraft departing from the bloc through its ReFuelEU proposal. Blending mandates, where it is compulsory for all jet fuel supplied to EU airports to have a certain proportion of SAF, are currently being negotiated in the context of ReFuelEU Aviation.

There are many types of SAFs. Renewable e-kerosene, a synthetic fuel made of CO₂ (e.g. captured from the atmosphere) and green hydrogen, is the most sustainable SAF and holds one of the keys to aviation’s decarbonization. But e-kerosene production will need to be greatly increased to make a difference.

The ReFuelEU text includes a sub-target for synthetic aviation fuels, like e-kerosene, which constitutes a great opportunity to foster e-kerosene production in Europe. However, the sub-target proposal of 0.7% by 2030 made by the European Commission is too low to have an incentivising effect on the market.

In this study, we quantify the total e-kerosene production plans in Europe. We show that there will be 0.16 Mt of e-kerosene available in Europe by 2025, produced by 10 companies, and 1.83 Mt in 2030, produced by at least 18 manufacturers. However, those growth predictions are highly reliant on favourable political conditions. Blending mandates at EU level need to be set high enough to support market ramp-up.

Deep dive: Investment in carbon capture rises as CO2 spikes,"Investment in carbon removal technologies is heating up, as global warming hits record heights.



The past month has seen the highest levels of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere in history, according to US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, while the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that the world is not on track to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.



Climate crisis means carbon removal is now necessary



Simply curbing emissions is no longer enough. Climate scientists now say in order to prevent dangerous rises in global temperatures, we must also remove carbon dioxide from the air that’s already been released.



Various studies have found that by mid-century the world may need to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year, on top of rapid emissions reductions, to halt warming at 2C or pull the climate back into a safer zone.



Current solutions, both technology and nature-based, include planting trees, building carbon-sucking machines, and spreading around carbon-absorbing minerals.



These carbon capture solutions, many the result of startups, are now leading the race against global heating, as they develop and deploy new, scalable, carbon capture technology that will enable us to both stop the flow and remove the historical carbon dioxide already emitted.



Global funding for carbon capture, utilisation and storage jumped more than fourfold last year to US$1.44bn, according to data from CB Insights, having previously only accounted for less than 0.5% of global investment in clean energy up to 2020.

And according to Viva Technology, carbon removal startups are likely to hit US$1 trillion by 2050.



But, in order to advance the commercial viability for such solutions and their deployment to scale, these solutions need investment.



And governments, big tech, corporates and VC firms are all responding with pledges and investment in a space that didn’t even exist a few years back.

"Curbing Other Climate Pollutants, Not Just CO2, Gives Earth a Chance","DURHAM, N.C. – Slashing emissions of carbon dioxide by itself isn’t enough to prevent catastrophic global warming, a new study shows. But if we simultaneously also reduce emissions of methane and other often overlooked climate pollutants, we could cut the rate of global warming in half by 2050 and give the world a fighting chance.

The study, appearing the week of May 23 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to assess the comparative impacts, through 2050, of cutting emissions of a broad range of climate pollutants versus targeting only carbon dioxide.

“Decarbonization is crucial to meeting our long-term climate goals, but it’s not enough,” said study co-author Drew Shindell, Nicholas Distinguished Professor of Earth Science at Duke University. “To slow warming in the near-term and reduce suffering from the ever-increasing heatwaves, droughts, superstorms and fires, we need to also reduce short-lived climate pollutants this decade.”

The new research shows that focusing our efforts almost exclusively on cutting carbon dioxide emissions, as most governments currently do, can no longer prevent global temperatures from rising above pre-industrial levels by 1.5 degrees centigrade. Such a rise would substantially increase the risks of tipping points at which irreversible impacts will occur. Cutting carbon alone may not be enough to even prevent temperatures from rising by 2°C, the study concludes.

“Our analysis shows that climate pollutants such as methane, nitrous oxide, black carbon soot, low-level ozone and hydrofluorocarbons contribute almost as much to global warming as longer-lived CO2,” Shindell said. “Since most of them last only a short time in the atmosphere, cutting them will slow warming faster than any other mitigation strategy.”

It would also help us avoid a short-term warming “backlash” that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned could occur by cutting fossil fuel emissions alone. Recent IPCC reports have projected that decarbonizing the energy system and shifting to clean energy in isolation could perversely cause temperatures to rise for a while because, in addition to CO2, fossil fuel emissions contain sulphate aerosols, which act to cool the climate for a very short time — from days to weeks — before they dissipate.

The new study accounts for this effect and concludes that focusing exclusively on reducing fossil fuel emissions could result in “weak, near-term warming” which could potentially cause temperatures to exceed the 1.5°C level by 2035 and the 2°C threshold by 2050.

In contrast, reducing both CO2 and other climate pollutants simultaneously would significantly improve our chance of remaining below the 1.5 degree centigrade mark.

Scientists at Georgetown University, the University of California Santa Barbara, Texas A&M University and the University of California San Diego conducted the new study with Shindell.

Support came from the Sequoia Climate Foundation, the Edward Frieman Foundation Chair Funds, and the Clean Air Task Force.

"This start-up makes vodka out of CO2 emissions, and it's backed by Toyota and JetBlue","At Bathtub Gin, a reinvented speakeasy in lower Manhattan, patrons may be pining for the past but they are drinking a vodka specifically invented for a cleaner future. Air Vodka is made in part from greenhouse gas emissions – specifically, captured carbon dioxide.

It is just one of a bevy of new products designed to make use of CO2 emissions that can be captured from various types of industry.

""We work with partners that capture that carbon dioxide before it's emitted into the atmosphere, and then we use that CO2 in our process in creating the alcohols that we create,"" said Gregory Constantine, Co-founder and CEO of Air Company, which is also producing perfume and hand sanitizer from those emissions. ""It's obviously far better for the planet in that we're removing CO2 for every bottle that we're creating.""

Distilling alcohol the old fashioned way not only releases its emissions, but it uses a lot of water — about 35 liters of water to make one liter of distillate. Air Vodka is made of just two ingredients, CO2 and water. It separates hydrogen out of the water through electrolysis, releasing the oxygen. The hydrogen is then fed into a ""carbon conversion reactor"" system with the captured CO2. That creates ethanol which, when combined with water, becomes a type of vodka.

The scientific process in the Air Company's laboratories is valuable to the environment, but the results are not cheap. The three-year-old start-up's vodka is a luxury brand, costing about $65 bottle. But at Bathtub Gin, the vodka is getting high praise.",,[],"['Diana Olick', 'In Dianaolick']"

Those behind the project - EDF’s Sizewell C, University of Nottingham, Strata Technology, Atkins and Doosan Babcock - gave an upbeat assessment of progress made in phase 1 of the UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Greenhouse Gas Removal innovation competition.

They say that a heat-powered direct air capture technology can be developed and in the future scaled up and integrated with the Sizewell C power plant, offering increased efficiency and less reliance on electricity compared with existing direct air capture technology and ""could utilise up to 400 megawatt therma of heat from the power plant to capture 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year, which is enough to almost offset the UK’s entire emissions from railway transport"".

The idea is to utilise heat (steam) from the turbine installation at Sizewell C power station when it is operational, removing CO2 from the ambient air where the concentration is around 400ppm by placing large volumes of air in contact with chemicals known as sorbents using an adsorption system, where the CO2 adheres to the solid surface of the sorbent material. The sorbents are then treated so that the CO2 is released from them and compressed for storage or reuse, while the adsorbent materials can also be re-used.

The consortium is among the bidders for phase 2 funding from the BEIS contest, and says ""the experiments performed using a lab-based pilot plant have enabled the process design"" for a 100 tonnes of CO2 per year demonstration plant to be completed.

Their proposal is to build the demonstration plant, at an estimated cost of GBP3.0 million (USD3.7 million), on a plot about 12 metres by 20 metres at, or around, the Sizewell C site, saying: ""The key advantage of siting the demonstration plant in or around the wider Sizewell C estate is that the environmental conditions that the adsorber column is exposed to will be representative of the potential commercial scale plant for integration with Sizewell C, subject to any necessary permissions and other consents being secured at the appropriate time.""

During the phase 1 trial the team discovered that a crosswind increased the efficiency of the system, but says that one area of study with the demonstration plant would be any impact of sea salt in the air, at the coastal location.

""Once significant data has been generated from the demonstration plant, giving further confidence in the technology’s commercial potential,"" the next stage of the plan is to progressively scale up to capturing 50,000 tonnes CO2/year by 2030 and ""we are exploring opportunities to make use of heat sources from other nuclear plants in the UK"".

It will then further scale up to the plant linked to Sizewell C ""capable of capturing CO2 on a Megatonne scale"", although it adds that ""an alternative nuclear (or other) plant needs to be identified with a heat source that could drive the process, as Sizewell C would not be in place by this time, but of course Sizewell C will be capable of driving carbon capture solutions at a megatonne scale when operational in the 2030s"".

The consortium's report also notes that the high-cost currently associated with direct air capture has been a ""major barrier to the development of a significant UK market"" but says the use of ""future low-cost, low-carbon heat available from a nuclear power plant"" means it could achieve the goal of removing CO2 at a megatonne scale at a cost of less than GBP200 per tonne of CO2 removed.

For that commercial-scale plant, Sizewell C is proposing to extract up to 400 MWt of heat from the nuclear power plant once operational. A ""minor modification to the power plant design will be required to implement cogeneration"", but Sizewell C ""does not expect any significant change to the replication of the design from Hinkley Point C or its safety case at this stage"".

The plan is for Sizewell C to feature two EPRs producing 3.2 GW of electricity, enough to power the equivalent of around six million homes. It would be a ""replica"" of Hinkley Point C plant, under construction in Somerset. EDF submitted a development consent order (a planning application) for the plant in May 2020 and if all goes well, has said it expects to make a final investment decision later this year or in 2023.

First study to measure total methane and CO2 emissions from liquefied natural gas carriers,"Graphical abstract. Credit: Environmental Science & Technology (2022). DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.2c01383

The results of a first-of-its-kind study to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers were released today, providing actionable data for the LNG shipping industry on methane emissions. The study, led by Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), helps improve the understanding of GHG emission profiles of LNG carriers to meet national and international climate targets and corporate climate strategies.

In 2021, a team of researchers from Queen Mary and SLR Consultants took direct measurements onboard the Cheniere-chartered GasLog Galveston for a roundtrip voyage from Cheniere's Corpus Christi liquefaction facility to a discharge port in Europe. The research covered all sources of methane and CO 2 emissions, including engine exhausts, venting and fugitive emissions. The study also sheds light on the best methods to directly measure methane emissions from LNG carriers, for future studies or retrofitting on-board continuous emissions monitors.

The results and recommendations were published today following peer-review in the journal Environmental Science and Technology (American Chemical Society) and include:

CO 2 emissions were lower than other studies have assumed, while venting and fugitive emissions of methane were also extremely low.

emissions were lower than other studies have assumed, while venting and fugitive emissions of methane were also extremely low. Uncombusted methane emissions from engine exhaust were in line with manufacturers' test data, but higher than other studies due to higher methane slip from the generator (non-propulsion) engines.

These engine methane slip emissions can be reduced drastically (as much as by half) by operating the engines at higher loads. The study notes that this was the Galveston's second voyage, and multiple engines were used at lower loads for operational reasons, and that carriers often utilize engines at higher loads.

The study recommends installation of methane emissions monitors on engine exhausts to monitor and report more accurate methane emissions estimates and to support methane mitigation operational practices.

Dr. Paul Balcombe, the Principal Investigator and lecturer in Chemical Engineering and Renewable Energy from Queen Mary University of London, said: ""This study helps to fill a big data gap when it comes to methane emissions from LNG shipping. It's vital that we understand what their emissions profile is at a time when LNG imports are likely to grow substantially to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian gas.

""This study is the first-of-a-kind to measure total methane emissions from engines aboard LNG carriers, including venting and fugitive emissions, but we need to do much more to get a representative sample of the approximately 600-strong LNG fleet. As well as these academic measurement studies, increased monitoring of emissions from engines, vents and fugitives would allow us to identify and implement effective reduction measures as hotspots are found.""

Fiji George, Cheniere's Senior Director for Climate and Sustainability, said: ""This study provides actionable recommendations to monitor and reduce LNG shipping emissions to further strengthen the climate benefits of LNG. Following the recommendations by the study, Cheniere is expanding our emissions monitoring on the majority of our chartered carriers to further put this science into action. We appreciate the work done by CAMS, QMUL and GasLog to help deliver data-driven transparency that can guide mitigation strategies.""

Kostas Karathanos, Gaslog's COO said: ""Gaslog is committed to support climate action and is investing in partnerships, research and development to achieve this. GHG and air emissions reduction is a priority for us, as reflected in our ESG focus areas; we therefore enthusiastically joined this initiative aiming to better understand and monitor methane emissions from LNG carriers. The industry needs similar studies to gather concrete data and establish confidence in the operational emissions. This is essential in determining impactful mitigating measures and pursue realistic reduction targets.""

The climatech startup converting CO2 into reusable carbon-based byproducts,"“When it comes to climate change, I want people to know that the time to act is now,” Carbonade co-founder and CEO Raanan Shelach told CTech in an interview. As a former fighter pilot in the Israeli Air Force, Shelach has seen the effects of climate change from the air, the barren deserts and dried up water ducts. “I’ve seen how the climate has impacted our way of life. Something needs to be done. We can’t wait for the government or politicians to take initiatives: we have to do something now,” he added. With making a meaningful difference in mind, Shelach worked at a defense company and a few startups. But somehow, climate was the issue that stayed on his mind. “In the Israeli Air Force, we’re constantly focused on how we have to protect ourselves from security threats, but also on how we can make the world better, safer.”

And once he met with fellow co-founder Yehuda Borenstein, everything clicked. The venture builder scouted universities searching for technologies that could solve real-world problems. The duo stumbled across a chemical catalyst, developed by scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, that when used with water can convert excess carbon dioxide into carbon byproducts - anything from detergents to plastic to building materials. “The same way you can use lemons to make lemonade, we want people to use our technology to make carbon byproducts, or Carbonade,” he said. The climatech startup was founded just last year.

More than just chemistry

There are several methods to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Aside from planting more forests, cultivating greener farming practices, and harboring healthy ocean life ecosystems, a more active method involves capturing carbon in the air using Direct Air Capture. This separates CO2 from the air and later buries it in the ground. The only issue, he noted, is that “all that carbon goes to waste, but we can make things with it.” The process is also highly-costly. “There’s still a huge demand for carbon in our day-to-day lives. Most people think carbon is a bad substance, but it’s the sixth most common element on earth; food is carbon, we are built out of carbon. The only issue is when we try to generate carbon we process fossil fuels that release more CO2 into the atmosphere. Our method is cleaner, greener; it’s more than just basic chemistry,” Shelach explained.

Most energy producing processes are based on thermal reactions. A product is placed in a high temperature setting, but the resulting byproduct has already used a lot of energy, and produced too much CO2. Carbonade has developed an electrochemical cell - similar to a fuel cell - that uses captured CO2, water, and electricity to produce a chemical reaction, which creates a new reusable carbon compound. Plenty of companies, he explained, are trying to produce green hydrogen, which splits water into its core components of hydrogen and oxygen. That can also later be used together with Carbonade’s product to create methanol, a green synthetic fuel that eliminates the need to extract fossil fuels from the ground.

Carbonade’s unique patented electrochemical CO2 reduction solution can be used to produce clean detergents and plastic. In addition, unlike traditional carbon reduction methods, it doesn’t require precious metals but common abundant metals, which lowers costs too. “We want to offer a commercially-attractive carbon product to meet the benchmark of today’s prices. Companies that will use our product need to be competitive and in high demand. We also use renewable energy to generate this electricity, such as wind farms and solar panels,” he added.

A sustainable solution

While nature captures CO2 naturally through forests, plants generate oxygen which they release into the air, and oceans and their underwater plants and sediments also absorb CO2, it still isn’t enough. “We have to let nature run its course, but it cannot handle the huge amounts of CO2 that we are manually producing every year - some 40 gigatons. Only ⅔ can be observed by nature, so we’re trying to get rid of the other ⅓ ,” he added. Traditional carbon capture facilities are installed nearby power plants or industrial chimneys, and absorb the CO2 like a sponge. So far, some exist in the U.S. and Europe. But these facilities are very expensive to build and not so efficient. “Our mission is to offer a sustainable solution that’s cheaper,” he added.

And Shelach also believes that when it comes to the climate challenge, humanity must offer realistic solutions. From his time spent flying jets, he believes there isn’t any alternative to jet fuel, which is also a major source of pollution. “There is no real alternative to jet fuel. Planes can’t run on electricity. You would need to fill an entire large airplane with batteries to allow it to fly. That’s why the only solution is to try and remove the CO2 from the air as best as we can.”

Building a better future

Carbonade is a deep tech and climatech startup, which for now operates remotely. It is currently at an early-stage pre-seed status, and plans to close its seed round within the coming weeks from several undisclosed climate-oriented venture capital firms. Shelach noted that the local climatech ecosystem in Israel is growing, but isn’t big enough yet. Some of that stems from negative speculation and lack of familiarity with the field, he thinks. “Some firms think it’s a risk to invest in climate technologies, but they don’t fully understand how they work and how crucial they are for mitigating climate change,” he said. Addressing the climate issue is best done through multiple technologies and approaches, and the more the merrier. “Maybe one day one of us will make a breakthrough, but for now we need to keep plowing forward by creating new solutions - whether through solar panels, batteries, green hydrogen, or carbon utilization,” he added.

And that hope for a better future can extend beyond Earth's boundaries and into space as well. Converting CO2 into a reusable substance isn’t just an Earth-based need, but has dual-use applications for space. “The atmosphere of Mars is 95% CO2, if humankind plans on inhabiting Mars one day, we’ll need to have unlimited feedstock that we can convert into energy, protein, and building materials,” he added. Two years ago NASA even published a call for proposals to find a solution to that quandary, noting that carbon byproducts can be used for good.

And while Carbonade is looking to the future, it still has a long way to go. Many climatech startups in Israel exist, but the ecosystem is still small. Shelach believes that the Israeli angle in this area is particularly unique. Aside from living in the Middle East where climate issues - such as poor rainfall and dry summers - are more common than in other parts of the world, Israeli culture teaches people to think out of the box. “This pushes us to improvise more and accept new approaches, and create more startups. It’s all about the willingness to hear new ideas even if they’re non-conventional,” he said.

Nevertheless, when it comes to building a startup, Shelach wants Carbonade to follow ESG (environmental, societal, and governmental) principles. “My dream is to build a good company - in line with ESG practices, and have an equal and diverse representation of men and women. I really believe it will help build a better community and brighter future. To take care of our environment, we really need to roll up our sleeves to make an impact.”

Enzyme-coated cotton offers a low-tech way to capture CO2,"Long met with skepticism, the idea of capturing carbon dioxide from air and from industrial smokestacks is now accepted as necessary to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Capturing carbon at low cost on a large scale will require innovative solutions.

Researchers now report one such method, involving simple, commonly found materials. It is a textile filter made of a cotton fabric that is coated with a special carbon dioxide-trapping chemical.

Given its simplicity, the filter removes carbon dioxide from air and gas mixtures at promising rates, the researchers from North Carolina State University report in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.

Over 130 commercial carbon capture projects are in the pipeline around the world to capture carbon dioxide from power plant or factory flue gas. Most rely on liquid solvents or porous solid materials to trap the greenhouse gas. The material then has to be heated at high temperatures to separate the carbon dioxide for burial or use, and to recycle the sorbing material. That regeneration of the sorbent takes a lot of energy and accounts for more than half of a carbon capture system’s operating cost.

Chemist and textile engineer Sonja Salmon and colleagues chose the natural enzyme carbonic anhydrase. In the human body, this enzyme helps transport carbon dioxide so it can be exhaled. The enzyme speeds up a reaction in which carbon dioxide and water combine to form bicarbonate, which is the main ingredient in baking soda.

The researchers started by dipping a two-ply cotton fabric into a solution of chitosan, a sugar molecule derived from the shells of crustaceans like lobsters and shrimp. The chitosan acts like a glue, helping attach a coating of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme to the textile.

To test the material, the team rolled up the fabric and put it in a tube. Then they pushed then pushed a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gases—similar to what is found in flue gases—through the tube along with a water-based solution. The carbon dioxide reacted with the water and the enzyme, creating liquid bicarbonate that dripped down the filter, where it could be captured and siphoned out.

When the researchers pushed air through the filter at a rate of four liters a minute, they were able to capture over 52 percent of carbon dioxide with a single-layer filter, and almost 82 percent with a double-layer filter. The material worked after being washed and dried five times.

“The enzyme can be maintained at a lower temperature for a very long time and it’s going to be durable,” said Jialong Shen, a postdoctoral research scholar and lead author of the paper in a press release. “The fabric provides physical support and structure for it, while providing a large surface area for it to react with the carbon dioxide.”

It’s a good first demonstration, but the team needs to test the material at much larger scale to test its viability in practical conditions. In the real world, a carbon capture material would have to content with 10 million liters of flue gas per minute.

Enex to build new CO2 refrigeration plant,"ITALY: Enex Srl is to establish a new €10m, 7,500m2 factory in Breda di Piave, Treviso, in response to strong growth projections for its CO2 refrigeration equipment.

A near €10m turnover business when acquired by CCC Holdings Europe in 2020, Enex turnover nearly doubled in 2021, is projected to increase nearly 50% this year, doubling again by 2025.

The new facility facility will include factory, office, and meeting space, as well as a 250m2 showroom. It will produce Enex medium- to large-size CO2 refrigeration units. The first production line plans are due to be operational in September, with the plant and all production lines and offices becoming operational during the first half of 2023.

Enex’s current factory, in Paese, will continue to manufacture its range of small refrigeration machines, including mini-boosters and heat pumps. It will also become the site of what Enex describes as “an industry-leading laboratory, the largest of its kind in Europe”, for research, development, and testing of the company’s full range of refrigeration, heating and air conditioning equipment.

“Our new facility will help us to meet the demand created for our high-efficiency, natural refrigerant-based solutions, which are critical to reducing global warming while providing consistent and reliable cooling for essential businesses such as supermarkets, distribution centres and cold food storage facilities,” said Sergio Girotto, CEO and founder of Enex.

Ship Owners Sought CO2 Exemption When the Sea Gets Too Wavy,"By ED DAVEY, Associated Press

The world's ocean freight shipping companies recently called on international maritime authorities to exclude pollution that their vessels spew in bad weather from new regulations, a condition that would apply almost a third of the time in the Atlantic. But the effort failed Friday.

Under international laws due to come into force in 2023, all big vessels will be rated from A to E by how much carbon dioxide flows from their stacks for every mile traveled and ton carried. The idea is to incentivize owners to install cleaner technologies. Although the proposed rules are currently toothless, nation states might bring in penalties for high-polluting ships in the future.

In April, four trade groups, including the World Shipping Council, complained that the new rules would penalize ships that have to sail in rough conditions. This burns more fuel and produces more carbon dioxide, meaning ships in windy seas would get a worse carbon efficiency rating.

So the trade groups proposed to the International Maritime Organization in written submissions that periods of eight hours or more undertaken in bad weather be struck from the scoring entirely. They defined bad weather as wind speeds of 28 knots or waves four meters (13.1 feet) high.

“It would pretend that ships hardly ever sail in stormy weather and only calculate the carbon intensity of the ship under the most favorable conditions,” said Bryan Comer, who heads up the marine program at the International Council of Clean Transportation.

The International Maritime Organization, made up of member countries, has now rejected that idea.

Going slow is one of the best ways to reduce emissions. If they had won the exemption, ships could have gone as fast as they wanted in bad weather, Comer said, burning more fuel than usual without it showing up in their ratings. This might enable them to hit tougher deadlines and win contracts.

“There is actually an incentive if this had gone forward to sail in adverse weather,” said Comer.

According to the World Shipping Council, waves exceed four meters in the North Atlantic more than 30% of the time.

The World Shipping Council argued that factors like extreme weather “distort the picture and make the numbers less effective at driving the change we want.”

The trade group conceded it was “logical at first glance” that the proposal might incentive ships to sail into heavy weather, but said the high cost of fuel made this very unlikely. It pointed out sailing in rough seas can use 30% more fuel than in calmer weather, thus saddling ships with a worse rating. Ships that routinely traverse calm waters such as those off Nigeria would more easily win top grades while those that have to cross the Atlantic would automatically look worse.

“Failing to address these inequities… unfairly labels certain ships as ‘inferior’ because of the routes they serve,” the World Shipping Council said.

James Gamble, a program director at Pacific Environment, which works to protect the Pacific Ocean and coastal communities, has also been following the negotiations.

The proposed regulations should be left as they are to achieve 2030 emissions targets, he said. While trade groups can give good advice on cutting emissions, their primary focus is on making members money, he said.

What was really at issue, Gamble said, is that “ships that are low-rated will be at a market disadvantage with customers who want to transport their goods with as little emissions as possible.”

The World Shipping Council represents more than a dozen companies, including the two largest ship owners, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) and Maersk.

Both have made stringent promises to cut greenhouse gases. MSC has pledged to hit net zero by 2050, while Maersk says it will do so ten years earlier.

The World Shipping Council said having a carbon intensity score that correctly reflects vessels’ energy efficiency is “crucial"".

Responding to a request for comment, the trade group took a somewhat different position than in its filings. An average rate of fuel use should be applied during rough seas, rather than subtracting these portions of the journey completely, the company said by email.

When The Associated Press pointed out the effect would be the same, because carbon efficiency ratings are a ratio and not a measure of total emissions, the company said “recent internal discussions” had led it to reconsider this suggestion.

It concluded, “I doubt that we will advance the idea” which “may offer little mathematical difference in the calculation.”

For the climate, it’s actual emissions that matter.

“The regulation would be working if ships that consume more fuel are graded more harshly,"" said marine emissions expert Bryan Comer.

Neither Maersk or MSC returned requests for comment.

Government report on CO2 pipeline leak in Mississippi could affect South Dakota Pipelines,"SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) -While the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission continues to review the application for the state’s first CO2 pipeline, a Government report about a life-threatening leak elsewhere in the Country could affect pipelines planned for our state.

Landowners are asking many questions about CO2 pipelines in light of a new report documenting a leak in Satartia, Mississippi, which provides crucial information to prevent a disaster like that here at home hopefully.

The February 2020 leak has been investigated by The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration, or PHMSA, a branch of the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Attorney Brian Jorde, who represents a group of South Dakota Landowners through his firm at Domina Law Group, is especially concerned about the lack of history and experience our nation has with CO2 pipelines.

“It’s such a new technology and concept and never been done at the scale currently contemplated across South Dakota and the Midwest, and laws, rules, regulations are simply way behind,” said Jorde.

The Government report reveals a need for more regulations and safety protocols. Summit Carbon Solutions Senior Project Advisor Chris hill has combed through the details.

“This investigative report primarily focused on emergency preparedness and response and geohazards,” said Hill. “So, where landslides could occur or worse, where significant erosion could take place around a river and so that’s what that advisory bulletin does, is it.

Geohazard bulletin, which PHMSA would enact, would require additional monitoring by the pipeline company, something that didn’t happen in the Mississippi leak.

That’s where the report involves South Dakota landowners, their livestock, and property. No one wants a leak like the one in Mississippi, which robbed people, animals, and even vehicles of oxygen.

“There were no fatalities, and there were no injuries,” said Hill.

Reporter Beth Warden asks about the reports of people foaming at the mouth incoherent. “Is that not considered an injury?” asked Warden.

“There was no one hospitalized overnight,” said Hill. “And so someone going to the hospital just to get checked out is apparently not classified as an injury.”

Proponents of the CO2 Pipeline say the 8 to 24-inch line in South Dakota will be good for the environment as it captures CO2 from ethanol plants in the area rather than releasing CO2 into the atmosphere.

Opponents, however, say the uncertain risk of an asphyxiant leak, coupled with the potential of eminent domain to a for-profit company, is not worth their personal potential of loss.

“I respect their right to make hundreds of millions of dollars and make their owners richer than they already are. But doing this on the backs of hardworking South Dakotans and elsewhere there requires a high level of scrutiny,” said Jorde.

His phone continues to ring with calls from South Dakotans.

“Fortunately, the notice requirements are pretty weak in South Dakota, and people are still kind of hearing about it and concern, and so we’re talking to folks every day,” said Jorde.

The South Dakota PUC continues to review the application for Summit Carbon Solutions, which requested their application review be lengthened from a deadline of early spring to June of 2023.

On May 8th, Jorde requested Summit’s application be thrown out, but that was denied.

Summit hopes to have its pipeline operational by 2024.

Another company intending to apply with the PUC for their CO2 pipeline is also talking to landowners. Navigator CO2′s Heartland Greenway pipeline project has just announced its partnership with POET ethanol plants to capture, transport, and store CO2.

Our staff has requested an interview in the past months with POET regarding CO2 created from their plants. We were told that POET uses their CO2 for making dry ice and carbonating beverages but were denied an interview.

Big tech’s growing embrace raises the stakes for CO2 removal,"It wasn’t the most auspicious start to a new era of global climate correction by tech mega-corporations.



Early in April, Swiss start-up Climeworks announced it had raised US$650 million from big investors for the expansion of Orca, a pioneering plant built amid the glaciers of Iceland that sucks CO2 from the atmosphere and buries it deep underground – a prototype, said Iceland’s prime minister Katrin Jakobsdottir, for a massive new global industry that could stave off runaway climate change. But just two weeks later, the machine ground to a halt after only six months of operation. It was a victim, said its operators, of freezing temperatures.

The company has not responded to our requests for an update on the state of the plant, but it has been reportedly forced to embark on design modifications. Its promise to extract 4,000 tonnes of CO2 from the air in the first year looks unlikely to be met.

Still, investors are not downhearted. Long-standing backer Microsoft, and new arrivals such as the reinsurance giant SwissRe are sticking with the project, which promises to be removing 40,000 tonnes within three years and more than 1 million tonnes by 2030.

They are far from alone in their enthusiasm for the carbon-eating technologies. April saw a Who’s Who of the world’s biggest tech companies putting up serious money for what seemed only a few years ago to be pipedreams: the cast included Meta, formerly Facebook; Alphabet, which owns Google; and the private foundation of the world’s richest man, Tesla tycoon Elon Musk.

So is this a new era for fixing climate change while allowing the world to continue its rampant burning of carbon-rich fossil fuels? Is it, as Peter Judge of the news service DatacenterDynamics describes it, “a ticket to continuous growth” for the global economy, and a licence for big tech’s part in it? If so, who will run and regulate this vast new global enterprise? And who will pay?

Carbon capture pledges and prizes

If carbon-capture technology is the future, then April 2022 may one day be seen as the moment it really took off. It was then that Meta, Alphabet, Canadian e-retailer Shopify, and Stripe, an Irish-American financial services company, all signed up for what they called the Frontier initiative. They collectively committed to buying US$925 million of carbon credits generated by capture technologies by the end of this decade. Their aim, they said, was to incentivise investment by creating a guaranteed market.

Days later, Stripe separately partnered with Lowercarbon Capital, a specialist venture capital firm, to create a new $350 million fund for capturing carbon.

But the biggest April headline-grabber, perhaps inevitably, came from Musk. His foundation announced the award of $1 million to each of 15 teams working on carbon removal that were shortlisted for its XPRIZE. In 2025, it will award $80 million to one of them. The eventual winner will by then have to demonstrate a plant or system that can remove at least 1,000 tonnes of CO2 a year from the air, along with a costed plan to remove 1 million tonnes and a demonstrable “pathway” to achieving a billion tonnes or more ­– out of the 40 billion-plus tonnes that we currently put into the atmosphere annually.

The technologies shortlisted by the Musk judging team – headed by chief scientist Marcius Extavour, a physicist from the University of Toronto – include everything from forest restoration to charging soils with charcoal, Climeworks-style air-capture to fertilising the oceans, and mineralising mine waste to climate-friendly farming. None are new ideas but, as the judges put it, “the XPRIZE is not an ideas competition; it is an execution and demonstration competition”.

There are sceptics. Some noted that even the $100 million in total prize money is tiny compared to the $44 billion Musk found to buy Twitter only days after the shortlist was announced. Julio Freidmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct, a research and investment firm, questioned the seduction of mega-prizegiving. Fifteen years ago, British aviation entrepreneur Richard Branson launched the Virgin Earth Challenge, offering $25 million for a technology to help remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Quietly withdrawn in 2019, it generated “much hoopla, poor design, collapse without a winner”, Freidmann said in a recent tweet.

Big tech companies with large sums of cash potentially have the power to set the agenda. The question is whether they should be allowed to do that.

Still, the current wave of sudden enthusiasm from big tech for carbon capture is genuine. One reason is that after many years of scepticism, climate scientists are growing keen. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its latest assessment on halting climate change, also published in April, concluded that direct CO2 removal “is essential” if the world is to halt global average temperature rises at 1.5C, the target reaffirmed by the world’s governments at COP26 in Glasgow last November.

Achieving that goal by reducing emissions alone will require halving them by the end of this decade, and producing zero new emissions by mid-century. Since that is likely to prove impossible, the gap will need to be filled by removing the excess from the atmosphere. A 2018 report from The Royal Society in the UK estimated the world’ may need to capture 810 billion tonnes of CO2 by the end of the century – the equivalent of 20 years’ current emissions.

Many means, none oven-ready

The wide range of technologies short-listed by Musk’s judges shows how uncertain it is which could prevail.

Climeworks’ machine has at least been in operation. It has giant fans that suck in large amounts of Icelandic air and pass it over proprietary chemicals, which remove the CO2 and create a compound that can then be heated to release the pure gas. This is then buried underground, where it reacts with the basalt rock and, says the company, “turns into stone within a few years”.

This requires a lot of energy. Clearly that should not come from burning fossil fuels. Climeworks chose Iceland as the facility could tap into local low-carbon energy from the nearby Hellisheidi geothermal power plant. But the technology remains expensive – currently costing $600–800 per tonne of CO2 removed, though the company hopes to reduce this to $250–300 by the end of the decade, as it scales up operations.

The company chose the location so the machines could be powered by renewable geothermal energy, but in April freezing temperatures forced operations to stop, putting the firm’s near-term CO2 removal targets in doubt.

This compares with assessments of the likely future “price” of carbon emissions and offsets at around $100 per tonne.

Climeworks’ chief rival for carbon capture using chemicals is currently Carbon Engineering, a company set up by Harvard professor David Keith, with funding from Microsoft founder Bill Gates and several American oil companies. But some investors are looking at other approaches.

Microsoft, which has promised to eventually offset its entire emissions since its founding in 1975, recently widened its carbon-capture portfolio. It now includes, among others, a scheme by Neustark, a Swiss-based tech start-up company, to grow plants and sequester their carbon in concrete.

Meanwhile, there is growing interest in a system for adding olivine, a silicate rock, to farm soils in order to accelerate weathering processes that draw CO2 out of the air. A study by the University of Sheffield, published in April, concluded that Britain could use this method to potentially achieve up to 45% of the emissions reductions needed to meet its net-zero target by mid-century. Study author Euripides Kantzas put the current cost of doing this at $250 per tonne, but said that could be halved by 2050. He says the additions would bring benefits for farmers, such as free fertiliser, but they would of course have to agree to it.

Recommended

Other “nature-based solutions” for capturing carbon in growing forests are available now and far cheaper, at only tens of dollars per tonne. The Bezos Earth Fund, set up by Amazon chief Jeff Bezos with $10 billion to spend in the next decade, publicly pledged money for this work at the COP26 climate conference last November.

But other tech entrepreneurs, and many scientists, say forests are too vulnerable to wildfires, pests and deforestation to make them reliable ways to capture carbon. Trees also take decades to grow and may then only have a short life. What the world really needs, say the tree-planting sceptics, is disposal of carbon for thousands of years, rather than a few decades.

Governing carbon capture

However it is done, sucking up CO2 may seem a benign activity with no downsides. But to work at the necessary scale, the technologies would need to be planting trees over areas of land the size of large countries, manipulating vast swathes of soils used by the world’s farmers, taking over wide areas of ocean to fertilise its plankton, covering landscapes in thousands of large machines to soak up CO2, and commandeering geology to bury it. So it will matter a great deal who is in charge of deployment, and how such decisions are made.

Big tech companies with large sums of cash potentially have the power to set the agenda, just as they have with the architecture of online business and social media. The question is whether they should be allowed to do that.

Tech giants, however rich, will only develop carbon capture to the necessary scale if there is a profit to be made

Academics at Oxford University set up the Climate Geoengineering Governance Project to consider such matters. Peter Healey, who coordinated the project with the recently deceased Steve Rayner, warns that geoengineering has “the potential for the imposition of undemocratic forms of technocratic management of climate”.

The pair drafted a set of Oxford Principles on Geoengineering Governance, which concluded that rather than handing the keys to the climate system over to tech entrepreneurs, there should be widespread public participation in decision-making, and full disclosure of all research – starting now. It remains to be seen whether an international system for doing so can be established.

But that still leaves a final question: who pays?

Tech giants, however rich, will only develop carbon capture to the necessary scale if there is a profit to be made. That means either governments stump up, or they require emitters of CO2 to pay to have those emissions offset through carbon capture.

Ultimately, if the world is serious about using technology to suck CO2 from ambient air, somebody has to pay.",,[],[]
CO2 removal buyers unite,"The push to support adoption of emerging carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques got a big nudge forward this week with the launch of new purchasing pledges by big corporate buyers.

The explicit announcements include a $500 million commitment by Alphabet, Microsoft and Salesforce to support CO2 removal projects, along with the launch of a new program that aims to facilitate the purchase of more than 1 million metric tons of verified carbon dioxide removal offsets by 2025.

The developments were catalyzed by the First Movers Coalition, launched in November by the World Economic Forum along with U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Change John Kerry. The first phase of the coalition’s mission centered on providing corporate procurement signals for companies developing low-carbon approaches and technologies for steel, cement, aluminum, chemicals, shipping, aviation and trucking. At that time, the group promised to support the commercialization of direct air capture and other advanced carbon removal approaches. Now, with more than 50 corporate partners on board, First Movers is starting to deliver on that promise, with a major expansion announced at the forum’s gathering in Davos: center on supporting carbon dioxide removal and near-zero emissions aluminum production.

As part of the CO2 removal initiative, Alphabet, Microsoft and Salesforce have collectively pledged a half-billion dollars — the Salesforce pledge, for example, is for $100 million to support ""durable"" CDR credits from ""technologies that can achieve scale by 2030.""

The expansion has also triggered the creation of another program, called the NextGen CDR Facility, backed by five founding buyers: business strategy firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG); private banking company LGT; transport fleet manager Mitsui O.S.K. Lines; reinsurer Swiss Re; and financial services firm UBS. BCG’s involvement calls for it to support the removal of 100,000 metric tons of CO2, while Mitsui and Swiss Re are pledging the removal of 50,000 metric tons, or $25 million in investment.

It is hoped that actions such as these will help make it more straightforward and more cost-effective for companies to support advanced carbon removal solutions. Over time, NextGen seeks to include other creditworthy buyers that have a serious commitment to reaching net zero but that don’t have the resources to research and validate such projects, according to Philip Moss, director of carbon removal markets for South Pole. (It’s talking with a number of companies that can’t yet be announced.)

[Continue the dialogue about new markets, technologies and products fueling the growth of business opportunities in carbon removal at the VERGE 22 Carbon Program, taking place in San Jose, CA, Oct. 25-27.]

""Ensuring the quality of carbon removals will be central in building a credible carbon removals market,"" said Mark Kenber, co-executive director of the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative, in a statement. ""What this facility is doing is instrumental to the creation of such a robust removals market … Regardless of the type of investment or timeline, there is still a need for clear benchmarks and verification when it comes to corporate climate action.""

South Pole is an ""implementing partner"" in carbon removal for the First Movers Coalition, along with Breakthrough Catalyst, Carbon Direct and Frontier. It announced a similar facility with Mitsubishi Corp. in May 2021 to procure and retire $300 million to $800 million in carbon removal credits by 2030. So it has the experience and resources to evaluate and manage the projects; it’s also allied with XPrize, which is providing additional technical expertise.

""Carbon removal is evolving from ideas to real projects on the ground,"" said XPrize Chief Scientist Marcius Extavour in a statement. ""As the market matures to support scale-up and deployment of these solutions, initiatives like this facility are crucial in creating transparent, reliable places to buy and sell carbon removal products and services.""

Carbon removal is evolving from ideas to real projects on the ground.

The programs announced this week are the latest demonstration of corporate interest in opportunities to procure carbon removal credits based on more technology approaches than those of traditional nature-based solutions. They build on groundbreaking work by the likes of tech firms Shopify and Stripe, which recently joined forces with Alphabet, Meta and McKinsey to create the $1 billion Frontier Fund, dedicated to funding carbon removal technologies through purchasing agreements.

For the past two years, in the lead-up to this week’s launch, South Pole has been evaluating carbon removal projects with the potential to produce high-quality credits and that would allow a broader array of potential buyers to participate. NextGen’s aim is to help buyers procure carbon removals at an average price of $200 per metric ton or less, Moss told me. (Prices for some emerging technologies today can cost far more than $400 per metric ton.) ""The majority of companies cannot participate in the way that the others have,"" Moss observed, pointing to the high-profile tech firms investing in emerging carbon removal technologies.

The NextGen projects will be focused on emerging technologies related to five approaches: biomass carbon removal and storage; direct air capture and storage; enhanced weathering; high-temperature biochar; and product mineralization. The methods being chosen (no specific projects were announced yet) are being verified to standards set by the International Carbon Reduction & Offsetting Alliance.

When I asked Moss about whether NextGen will collaborate with efforts such as the Frontier Fund, he suggested that a best practices network is emerging. ""Anyone bringing demand to the market is welcome,"" he told me.

As we saw with the corporate renewable procurement movement, there’s definitely strength in numbers. Right now, buying commitments for advanced carbon removal are still limited — in large part because of the pricing dynamics and the unproven nature of the technologies. The more potential carbon removal buyers can unify their voices on procurement requirements and benefits, the faster this market will evolve.",,[],[]
Elon Musk Alarmed by Tesla Feature That Spikes CO2 Levels Inside Vehicle,"What is going on with Tesla?

Air Metal

Turns out that a Tesla feature could have a concerning design flaw that increases carbon dioxide levels for passengers.

In response to a promotional clip posted by Tesla on Sunday, one customer said the company's recirculation feature, which makes use of air already in the cabin, causes spikes in carbon dioxide levels and had even given him headaches. The user shared a graph he created in 2020 using carbon dioxide level data he said he had gathered from inside his Tesla.

""Note that when recirculation is on in Teslas, the ambient CO2 concentration in the air spikes to extremely high levels. I used to get headaches on road trips but w/o recirc I do not,"" the commenter wrote.

Musk Treatment

It was enough to get Tesla CEO Elon Musk's attention, who responded to the complaint himself.

""We will look into this and adjust,"" Musk said yesterday. ""In general, I’d recommend against using recirc, as the range advantage is small.""

It's a little hard to gauge what's going with Tesla these days.

Shareholders are irate that Musk has spent so much time and public attention on a now-bungled deal for the billionaire to buy the entirety of Twitter, and just last week he announced that Tesla was pausing hiring because of a ""bad feeling"" before confusingly reversing course.

Now, Musk is telling customers a key efficiency feature isn't advantageous and could actually be harmful.

It all underscores the key lesson in Muskworld: expect chaos.

"For Wetland Plants, Sea Level Rise Stamps Out Benefits of Higher CO2","For Wetland Plants, Sea Level Rise Stamps Out Benefits of Higher CO2

The following is an excerpt from a news story by Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health.

Wetlands across the globe are in danger of drowning from rising seas. But for decades, scientists held out hope that another aspect of climate change—rising carbon dioxide (CO2)—could trigger extra plant growth, enabling coastal wetlands to grow fast enough to outpace sea level rise. That helpful side effect is disappearing, they discovered in a new study in the journal Science Advances.

“In some ways, this is a race,” said co-author Lew Ziska, professor of Environmental Health Sciences at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and a plant physiologist. “A race between what CO2 can do and what sea level can do.”

Ziska, who began as a post-doc the second year of this study, has seen in his lifetime the shift in perception, from climate change as an issue for our grandchildren, to a matter of concern now. ”[S]ea-level rise threatens one of the globe’s largest carbon sinks, marsh and wetlands — another facet of how wide-ranging, pervasive climate change is affecting the world around us,” he said.

“Too much water is a stress, an environmental stress, for plant response to high CO2,” said Chunwu Zhu, lead author. Zhu, a biologist with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, conducted the study while on a fellowship with the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.

The study took place at the Smithsonian’s Global Change Research Wetland on the western shore of Maryland. The wetland is home to several futuristic experiments, where scientists simulate the climate of 2100. For this study, the researchers relied on an experiment that started in 1987—currently the world’s longest-running field experiment on how rising CO2 impacts plants. Inside 15 open-top chambers, scientists have been raising CO2 concentrations by an additional 340 parts per million, roughly doubling atmospheric CO2 levels of 1987.

European Parliament vote on CO2 for cars and vans: automobile manufacturers react,"Brussels, 9 June 2022 – The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) takes note of the European Parliament’s plenary vote on CO2 reduction targets for cars and vans. It now urges MEPs and EU ministers to consider all the uncertainties facing the industry, as it prepares for a massive industrial transformation.

ACEA welcomes the fact that the Parliament maintained the European Commission’s proposal for 2025 and 2030 targets. These targets are already extremely challenging, and only achievable with a massive ramp-up in charging and refuelling infrastructure, the association cautions.

However, given that the transformation of the sector is dependent on many external factors which are not fully in its hands, ACEA is concerned that MEPs voted to set in stone a -100% CO2 target for 2035.

“The automobile industry will fully contribute to the goal of a carbon-neutral Europe in 2050. Our industry is in the midst of a wide push for electric vehicles, with new models arriving steadily. These are meeting customers’ demands and are driving the transition towards sustainable mobility,” stated Oliver Zipse, ACEA President and CEO of BMW.

“But given the volatility and uncertainty we are experiencing globally day-by-day, any long-term regulation going beyond this decade is premature at this early stage. Instead, a transparent review is needed halfway in order to define post-2030 targets.”

“Such a review will first of all have to evaluate whether the deployment of charging infrastructure and the availability of raw materials for battery production will be able to match the continued steep ramp-up of battery-electric vehicles at that point in time.”

It is now also essential to deliver on the rest of the necessary conditions to make zero-emissions possible. ACEA is therefore calling on decision makers to adopt the different elements of Fit for 55 – particularly CO2 targets and the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) – as one coherent package.",,[],[]
Ethos sets target to cut CO2 emissions with new climate strategy,"Ethos, the Swiss foundation for sustainable development, has set a target to reduce the CO 2 emissions in its investment funds – 91.5% by 2050 – as per its newly- published climate strategy for 2022-2050.

The carbon intensity will be reduced by 34.5% by 2025, by 56% by 2030, and by 78.1% by 2040, aligning its investment funds to a global warming path well below 2°C and as close as possible to 1.5°C by 2030 at the latest, it added.

Ethos’s climate targets – approved by the members of the foundation and its shareholders at its annual general meeting last week – apply to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of companies held in its equity investment funds (Swiss Sustainable Equities, Equities CH Indexed Corporate Governance, Vontobel Fund Equities Swiss Mid & Small, Clartan ESG Europe Small & Mid Cap, Equities Sustainable World), and from 2023 to the Ethos Swiss Bonds and Ethos Bonds International funds, the climate strategy stated.

The foundation is taking action to cut emissions coming largely from companies in its investment funds that should in the future rely on a climate strategy and take measures to decarbonise business activities.

Ethos said that figures will be adjusted once investee companies have published their data on GHG emissions for 2021 and the data will be available to investors. It will start to calculate emissions for the bond funds once the methodology is finalised, it added.

The carbon intensity of Ethos’s funds, calculated on the assets recorded in 2021, was 209 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2021, up from 201 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2020 and down from 322 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested, according to the climate strategy report.

Assets in the funds increased year-on-year from CHF1.03bn in 2019, to CHF1.50bn in 2020 and CHF2.05bn in 2021, the report added.

In particular, the carbon intensity in the Clartan ESG Europe Small & Mid Cap fund jumped from 442 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2020 to 1,996 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2021 because companies Nexans and Rexel were included in the fund, Ethos said.

The carbon intensity in the Vontobel Fund Equities Swiss Mid & Small also increased from 178 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2020 to 204 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2021.

The carbon intensity in the Swiss Sustainable Equities and Equities CH indexed Corporate Governance funds saw an uptick in 2021 to 171 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested and 241 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested, respectively.

In the fund Equities Sustainable World excluding Switzerland, instead, carbon intensity decreased from 465 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2020 to 364 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2021.

Ethos has also set a target of 100% by 2040 of owned companies with science-based 1.5°C reduction targets validated by an independent organisation. Currently the Vontobel fund counts only 8% of such companies, the Clartan fund 28%, the Equities Sustainable World 36% the Equities CH indexed Corporate Governance 40%, and the Swiss Sustainable Equities fund 44%.

It will intensify the engagement with companies that do not have targets validated by an independent organisation and from 2025 it will exclude the companies in the fossil fuel sectors that have not set reduction targets for their emissions validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) or a similar organisation.

From this year Ethos will also oppose at AGMs to the re-election of chairs of sustainability committees, or board of directors if such a committee does not exist, of companies with high GHG emissions that do not have a convincing climate strategy or that have not set and validated reduction targets for their GHG emissions.

It will extend this policy to all companies from 2025.

Mitsui Chemicals Partners with Mitsui-Soko Holdings to Calculate CO2 Emissions from International Transport of Products,"Mitsui Chemicals, Inc. 4183 President &,HASHIMOTO)) has worked in partnership with Mitsui-Soko Holdings Co., Ltd. 9302 President &,KOGA)) to develop a method of calculating CO 2 emissions resulting from international transport of its products over the last three years.

This method will enable Mitsui Chemicals to calculate and disclose virtually all CO 2 emissions at all stages from raw materials through to production and shipping. The method used to calculate emissions due to the shipment of products is notable for being a highly precise one whose validity has been verified by a third-party international organization.

Both companies will continue to work together to visualize CO 2 emissions in real time via a digital logistics platform provided by Mitsui-Soko Holdings.

Mitsui Chemicals used the service for calculating CO 2 emissions from international transport offered as part of Mitsui-Soko Holdings' SustainaLink logistics sustainability support service. The calculation was carried out by analyzing tens of thousands of data points held by Mitsui Chemicals for each mode, product and sector.

The formula used to calculate emissions is based on a method that encompasses international transport and complies with the GLEC Framework. In April 2022, the formula became the first in Japan to be assessed and verified as valid by third-party organization DNV.

Mitsui-Soko Holdings intends to continue identifying CO 2 emissions from transport, visualizing the effects of reducing CO 2 emissions across the supply chains of Mitsui Chemicals and other clients, and proposing specific logistics solutions aimed at achieving actual reductions.

In November 2020, Mitsui Chemicals announced its commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In addition to giving consideration to the environment in the realm of production, Mitsui Chemicals will continue to undertake initiatives aimed at reducing the burden on the environment resulting from product shipment and delivery by visualizing transport volumes and CO 2 emissions.

Mitsui Chemicals' carbon neutral strategy is centered around the two pillars of (1) reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions throughout each supply chain and (2) maximizing the reductions in emissions accruing to products and services over their entire life cycle. Based on this strategy, Mitsui Chemicals will seek to create a sustainable society by stepping up a variety of efforts aimed at contributing to the transformation of society.

""Mitsui Chemicals has created a Purchasing Division, Logistics Division and a number of other divisions under the new Digital Transformation Sector established this past April and is shifting up a gear in its efforts to promote digital transformation throughout the company, including our supply chains,"" said SAMBE Masao, Chief Data Officer and Managing Executive Officer, Mitsui Chemicals. ""We're honored to have been able to calculate CO 2 emissions from international transport by Mitsui Chemicals using the service provided by Mitsui-Soko Holdings, which is the first in Japan to have had its validity assessed by a third-party organization.

""Mitsui Chemicals will help realize a sustainable society by leveraging digital transformation to visualize CO 2 emissions in real time and promoting reductions in the environmental burden resulting from product shipment and delivery.""

""Mitsui-Soko Holdings is proud to be able to implement this initiative in partnership with Mitsui Chemicals, which is one of Japan's leading general chemical manufacturers and is promoting efforts to reduce the burden on the environment from multifaceted perspectives,"" said KIRIYAMA Tomoaki, Senior Executive Officer, Mitsui-Soko Holdings. ""We'll be stepping up efforts to support initiatives by Mitsui Chemicals and our other clients to reduce environmental burdens arising from supply chains, proposing specific logistics solutions aimed at creating a sustainable society.""

Analysis: China’s CO2 emissions see longest sustained drop in a decade,"Lauri Myllyvirta , analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air covering air quality and energy trends in China.

China’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fell by an estimated 1.4% in the first three months of 2022, making it the third quarter in a row of falling emissions.

The new analysis for Carbon Brief, based on official figures and commercial data, shows that the three consecutive quarters, when seen together, represent the longest emissions decline in China for at least a decade.

Emissions peaked in summer 2021, as the government tightened policies on real estate to mitigate speculation and financial risk, before starting to fall in the third quarter last year. The fall in late 2021 and early 2022 was driven by the continued real estate slowdown and strong increases in clean energy. Starting from late March – at the very end of the period covered by this analysis – the main driver has become harsh Covid-19 control policies.

Furthermore, the second quarter of 2022 appears highly likely to extend the trend of falling emissions – even as the construction sector slowdown bottoms out – due to the impact of Covid lockdowns becoming much more pronounced.

In April, thermal power generation fell by the most since December 2015, the fall in cement output accelerated and apparent consumption of refined oil fell by almost as much as during the first Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020.

This analysis is the latest in a series of quarterly Carbon Brief updates, with the previous one having reported on the quarterly fall in China’s emissions in the third quarter of 2021.

Longest fall

China has previously seen only two periods of stable or falling CO2 emissions in the past decade. First, during the construction and industrial slowdown of 2013-16, emissions growth halted for three years, with quarterly growth rates alternating between positive and negative.

Then, in the first quarter of 2020, the initial nationwide Covid-19 lockdowns resulted in a steep – but short-lived – drop in emissions.

After the lockdown ended in April 2020, the government responded to the negative economic shock with policies designed to boost construction, exports and industrial output, resulting in a highly energy- and carbon-intensive recovery seen in the chart below.

Emissions first exceeded their pre-Covid-19 level in the second quarter of 2020, but growth soon cooled. The string of three consecutive quarters of falling emissions – starting in the third quarter of 2021 – is the longest in at least a decade.

Monthly values are scaled to annual data on fuel consumption in annual Statistical Communiques and National Bureau of Statistics annual Yearbooks. Chart by Joe Goodman for Carbon Brief using Highcharts

The construction slowdown that explains much of the decline in the last few quarters was showing signs of bottoming out in the period to March, with the fall in steel output moderating to 5% year-on-year. This was also expected given the government’s emphasis on speeding up infrastructure and construction projects.

Nevertheless, the second quarter of 2022 still appears highly likely to extend the trend of falling emissions. In April, the economic fallout from the new round of Covid-19 lockdowns became much more pronounced, becoming the main driver of falling emissions.

Drivers of falling emissions

The largest contributor to the fall in CO2 emissions in the first quarter of this year was the cement industry, where output fell 12%, followed by the power and steel industries.

Another contributing factor was the drop in oil consumption, where the effect of Covid-19 control measures was already apparent.

These contributions can be seen in the chart, below, which shows year-on-year changes in quarterly CO2 emissions in China, broken down by sector for coal and cement (lower bars), and by fuel for oil and gas (top bar).

Chart by Joe Goodman for Carbon Brief using Highcharts

Steel and cement are China’s second and third largest emitting sectors, and the demand for both sectors is largely driven by construction activity, which has been contracting since summer 2021 due to the tighter policies on real estate lending and debt.

While output fell in both sectors, analysis of official data for April started to show diverging trends. Steel output fell by 5% year-on-year in April, much less than in previous months, indicating that output is bottoming out. Pig iron output was at the same level as a year ago, the first non-negative reading in almost a year.

To counteract the real estate slowdown and make it possible to reach GDP targets, the government has been promoting infrastructure investment, which requires a lot of cement, and also quite a lot of steel.

Yet cement output fell a massive 19% year-on-year in April, even more than in previous months. One possible explanation is that in new construction projects, steel is required before cement, to build the reinforcement. Both sectors were affected by falling investment in real estate construction, which saw a 3% reduction year-on-year. Additionally, the steel demand recovery was partially supported by the manufacturing industry.

In the power sector, thermal power generation increased 1% year-on-year in the first quarter, but improved power plant thermal efficiency and fuel switching still resulted in a drop in coal consumption.

The economic statistics for April report a steep drop in thermal power generation: output from thermal power plants fell 12% year-on-year. This is the largest reduction since December 2015, eclipsing the drop seen during the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown even though electricity demand fell more at that time.

The sharp reduction in thermal power output this April was due to a combination of weak demand – down 4% year-on-year – combined with strong growth of clean energy.

Half of the reduction was due to lower electricity demand, one quarter was due to strong growth in wind and solar output, and one quarter due to good hydropower operating conditions. Power generation from wind and solar increased 15% and 25% year-on-year respectively, while hydropower output jumped 17%.

Wind, solar and nuclear combined will almost certainly overtake hydropower for total generation this year, which is remarkable given the size of China’s hydropower industry.

This development is also positive for the growth of China’s clean energy output overall, as these technologies have very large growth potential, whereas the potential for hydropower expansion has largely been exhausted, as seen in the limited increase projected in long-term energy scenarios for China.

Major push for more coal mines, power plants and blast furnaces

Even as China’s coal demand is falling, the output from domestic coal mines is increasing rapidly. This resulted in a major overall drop in coal imports in the first quarter of the year, as reported by China Customs, and allowed coal plants and other operators to fill up stockpiles that were depleted during last year’s coal shortage.

Investment in new coal- and gas-fired power capacity is also continuing at a high level. In the first four months of the year, at least 18 thermal power projects started construction, with a total capacity of 12.8 gigawatts (GW). Another 19 projects with a total capacity of 13.0GW were approved for construction.

​​Investment in new steel capacity also stayed at a high level. From January to May 2022, 28m tonnes of new coal-based (blast furnace) iron-making capacity was approved, according to CREA’s compilation of new announcements.

These projects will replace older blast furnaces with brand-new capacity, with a long expected life. This makes the sector ill-equipped to adjust to a reduction in demand for pig iron, as steel demand growth slows down and more steel is produced from scrap instead of pig iron. The amount of new capacity approved corresponds to rebuilding 5% of the existing blast furnace capacity every year.

In steelmaking, our mapping shows new investments have shifted towards electric steelmaking. For the first time, approved new electric arc furnace capacity overtook basic oxygen furnace capacity.

The government is aiming to boost infrastructure and other construction, again, this year to hit GDP targets, or at least shrink the shortfall. This could result in an increase in coal demand towards the second half of the year, but the data to date suggests little sign of this so far.

One reason for the push for more coal output and coal power plants is that the 2021 coal shortage, and the resulting power rationing, were clearly something China’s central planners want to avoid at any cost.

This has prompted the “all-of-the-above” expansion of coal mining, coal-fired power and clean energy, to ensure similar shortages are avoided. The energy security drive has meant that measures to avoid overcapacity, such as the coal power traffic lights system and coal power capacity control targets have not been published, and the closure of older coal power plants has been put on hold. The planners appear prepared to accept the risk of building too much capacity, even if it ends up under-utilised and risks financial losses.

Avoiding any electricity shortages is all the more important because of the political importance of this year – the twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress that selects the party’s new leaders is scheduled for later in 2022.

Furthermore, the Chinese government is currently pushing for all kinds of infrastructure and construction projects to offset the effect of the real estate slump and Covid lockdowns on other parts of the economy. Coal mines, power plants and blast furnaces are just some of the recipients of this government backing.

The support for construction projects is also benefiting low-carbon technologies. Solar PV installations increased 140% year-on-year in the first four months of 2022 and wind installations by 45%. As approximately 103GW of wind and solar was installed last year, the early part of 2022 puts it on track for another world record in terms of annual growth.

Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing continues to skyrocket. Output more than doubled, again, in January-April compared with one year ago, while overall auto production fell. EVs made up a record 21% of all vehicles produced.

Will emissions rebound?

The sharply fluctuating energy trends and economic policies make it difficult to predict energy demand growth in China in the months and years ahead.

The previous episodes of falling emissions in China have been followed by rebounds. After the 2007 financial crisis, the government launched an unprecedented stimulus programme, leading to even faster emissions growth than before the crisis.

The 2013–16 slowdown was followed by a more gradual rebound – and after the Covid-19 lockdown, emissions surged far above pre-Covid levels, as seen in the chart below.

Annualised CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and cement broken down by sector and fuel, million of tonnes. Emissions are estimated from National Bureau of Statistics data on production of different fuels and cement, China Customs data on imports and exports and WIND Information data on changes in inventories, applying IPCC default emissions factors and annual emissions factors per tonne of cement production until 2019. Monthly values are scaled to annual data on fuel consumption in annual Statistical Communiques and National Bureau of Statistics annual Yearbooks. Chart by Joe Goodman for Carbon Brief using Highcharts

Stimulating construction, rather than incomes and consumption, is a long-running feature of China’s response to negative economic shocks. This results in periods of carbon-intensive growth, as producing steel and cement for construction is far more emissions-intensive than producing consumer goods and services.

Since late 2021, the government has sought to increase and speed up infrastructure and other construction projects, following the same pattern.

Whether the current fall in emissions results in another rebound depends mainly on three factors: how large is the infrastructure construction programme this time; will the real estate sector inflate again; and how fast does clean energy investment grow.

An indiscriminate wave of stimulus projects would go against the government’s aims of achieving “high-quality growth“, as well as on avoiding debt and financial risks.

There is also a practical question of how large an investment programme local governments are willing and able to underwrite, given their already high debt levels and the significant damage to their finances from the contraction in real estate and land sales.

Real estate has continued to contract. In April, government figures show the floor space of newly started buildings fell to the lowest level since 2015.

The central bank and many local governments have taken steps this year to support real estate, including by easing mortgage conditions. In 2020, the money people did not consume found its way to real estate, resulting in a major increase in steel demand and emissions in late 2020 and early 2021.

In 2022, the drop-off in real estate sales has been even deeper than during the initial lockdowns in 2020, as lack of confidence and uncertainty over economic outlook have dampened appetite.

Even if energy demand growth rebounds to a moderate level due to the stimulus programme or a general economic recovery, the effect on emissions could be offset by rapid expansion of clean energy.

Central and local governments have set very ambitious targets for wind and solar power installations during the five-year period from 2021 to 2025. If fully realised, the planned clean energy expansion could cover all additional energy demand growth over the period, enabling coal consumption and emissions to peak before 2025.

Data sources

Data for the analysis was compiled from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, National Energy Administration of China, China Electricity Council and China Customs official data releases, and from WIND Information, an industry data provider.

When data was available from multiple sources, different sources were cross-referenced and official sources used when possible, adjusting data from WIND Information to match.

CO2 emissions estimates are based on National Bureau of Statistics default calorific values of fuels and IPCC default emissions factors. Cement CO2 emissions factor is based on 2018 data.

For oil consumption, apparent consumption is calculated from refinery throughput, with net exports of oil products subtracted.

When official releases did not provide changes from 2021 to 2022, these are calculated from the linked release and previous iterations of the same regular release, although only the latest one is linked to.",,[],[]
These aprons absorb CO2: Wearable tech could transform the restaurant industry,"A restaurant in Stockholm, Sweden, is asking staff to wear aprons that capture greenhouse gas from the air.

The aprons were produced in a pilot scheme developed by H&M-backed researchers, as the fashion industry struggles to lower its climate impact.

The Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA) developed the chemical process. It comes in the form of an amine-containing solution which is used to treat cotton - fibre, yarn or fabric - making the material pull carbon dioxide towards it and capture it. This then stabilises it and stores it on the surface of the textile.

The team were inspired by techniques used in chimneys of coal-fired power plants to limit emissions.

""Many power plants have to scrub as much carbon dioxide as they can out of the air before the exhaust is released,"" says HKRITA CEO Edwin Keh. ""We thought 'why don't we try to replicate that chemical process on a cotton fibre"".

One apron is able to absorb about a third of what a tree absorbs per day.

One apron is able to absorb about a third of what a tree absorbs per day.

""The (capturing) capacity isn't super high but this is quite inexpensive to produce and quite easy, and we think there are a lot of potential applications,"" explains Keh.

In the restaurant, after the aprons are used, they are heated to 30-40 degrees Celsius.

At this high temperature, they release the CO2 they were storing - and this is then used in the restaurant’s greenhouse to feed to plants.

“It is used as food for the plants so it completes the photosynthesis cycle and then once again it becomes nutrient for plants,"" says Keh.

Fashion giants are under pressure to change their ways

Fashion giants are under increasing pressure to address the enormous carbon footprint they produce as shoppers become more aware of the environmental impact of clothes and as global temperatures rise.

Swedish fast fashion chain H&M has been severely criticised for its huge negative impact on the environment.

But the H&M foundation claims the innovation could potentially be a game-changer in the reduction of global CO2 emissions.

Projects to develop CO2 absorbing textiles are however at an early stage, and their potential contribution to lessening the environmental impact of the textile industry remains to be seen.

Keh says the institute will now develop its technology further, and try to find other uses for it, as well as other ways to use or dispose of the captured CO2.

Scientists: global warming cannot be stopped without CO2 traps,"Demonstration of measures to curb climate change. Credit: Shutterstock

Reducing the consumption of fossil fuels is not enough to prevent the world's average annual temperature from rising by two or more degrees above pre-industrial levels. Russian scientists at NUST MISIS are convinced that global climate change cannot be stopped without the development of technologies for removing carbon dioxide from the air. The results of their study are presented in Thermal Engineering.

The anthropogenic factor is considered to be the main cause of climate change. The use of fossil fuels, agriculture and forestry are among the main drivers of global warming.

In accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement signed in 2015, the world community is striving to prevent the global average annual temperature on the planet from exceeding 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100 and to do everything possible to keep warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius.

According to last year's report of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), this decade is the last chance for humanity to take the measures needed to slow global warming.

Scientists from NUST MISIS, the Moscow Power Engineering Institute and the Energy Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences have analyzed key trends in global energy and climate indicators, and concluded that although the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement are unattainable, there is no reason for apocalyptic sentiment.

Despite the fact that fossil fuels account for up to 90% of carbon dioxide emissions, the intensity of CO 2 emissions per unit of energy consumed has steadily decreased over the past 100 years, the authors of the study note.

However, energy consumption in each country is highly dependent on climate and geographical factors. With the world's population projected to grow to 10 billion people, global energy consumption will rise to 28–30 billion tons of coal equivalent by 2100, just 30–40% more than today. While many international experts predict growth in energy consumption of up to 60, 100 and even 200 billion tons, such projections are based on the erroneous assumption that developing countries require the same amounts of energy to achieve a standard of living comparable to that of Western countries.

This theory does not take into account the geographical factor: most of the so-called developed countries are located in the middle and high latitudes, and up to 40% of all energy consumption is spent on space heating. In addition, climate change is also having an impact on energy consumption. Thus, according to various estimates, the total energy consumption in Russia over the past 30 years has decreased by 10 to 15%, and energy costs for heating premises—by 15–20%.

Alexander Klimenko, Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, leading expert at the NUST MISIS Competence Center says, ""In our work, we explain the discrepancy between the constant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the non-monotonic increase in global temperature. There are periods when its growth is clearly slowing down and even halting. It would seem that the higher the concentration of carbon dioxide, the greater the greenhouse effect, the higher the temperature. In fact, the global temperature is also influenced by other factors—not of anthropogenic, but of natural origin. Taking into account all factors allows us to understand the nature of the change in global temperature and build reliable forecasts of its behavior in the future.""

In their forecast, Russian researchers predict that the anthropogenic impact on climate systems will soon begin to weaken, and the peak values of carbon dioxide emissions will be reached in 10 to 15 years. According to the research, they will amount to 10 to 11 billion tons per year in terms of clean carbon, which is slightly different from today's 9.5 billion tons. This is, among other things, the result of the rapid expansion of the share of renewable energy in global energy production. Further gradual reduction of emissions will follow. Nevertheless, by the end of the century, their volumes will remain at least 6 billion tons per year.

In achieving full carbon neutrality, the so-called carbon capture technologies (""carbon traps"") will help: the ocean, living biota (forests) and geological formations capable of capturing and retaining carbon dioxide. However, natural resources in this sense are limited, so achieving global carbon neutrality exclusively by natural capacity by 2050 doesn't seem feasible.

Industrial technologies for removing carbon dioxide from the air can help to control the rate of warming without completely abandoning fossil fuels, but they are now expensive, which is an obstacle to their widespread distribution. At present, only 26 such facilities operate worldwide in eight countries, and their combined capacity is only sufficient to capture less than one tenth of a percent of total emissions.

However, the authors of the study are confident that without the development of such technologies, the goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century will not be achievable.

• By using this new tool, 'imaginers' will be able to determine their impact on the planet and how to reduce their carbon footprint.

• For every new user who calculates their carbon footprint, imagin will offset 5kg of CO2 and contribute to reaching its commitment of offsetting 200 tonnes of CO2 in 2022.

• This is the latest project in addition to other initiatives that imagin, through imaginPlanet, is undertaking in the area of sustainability, in order to create a positive impact on the planet and on society as a whole.

• It follows the third edition of the imaginPlanet Tour held last week, during which two influencers cycled around the island of Mallorca to promote reforestation, and which saw the involvement of more than 70,000 users in the Strava community.

imagin, the digital services and lifestyle platform powered by CaixaBank, continues to promote its users' awareness of sustainability by launching a new tool as part of its app enabling imaginers to calculate their carbon footprint. With the CO2 calculator, more than 3.7 million imagin users will be able to measure their impact on the planet.

The new feature of the app allows imaginers, based on their answers to a survey on their lifestyle habits involving food consumption, shopping, home and travel, to accurately calculate their carbon footprint and find out where they stand compared to Spain's average and to the recommended value. Users will also be able to access content with recommendations and tips to improve their habits, helping them to become more sustainable and further lower their carbon footprint.

This project is part of the set of products, services, content, agreements and initiatives focused on sustainability that imagin, through imaginPlanet, is developing to drive positive impact on the planet and on society as a whole. In order to incentivise the imaginers' involvement in this initiative, imagin will offset 5kg of CO2 for every new user who calculates their carbon footprint leveraging this new tool. This action will also further imagin's commitment to offset 200 tonnes of CO2 in 2022.

New actions and content with a positive impact

Through this initiative, imagin is reinforcing its clear commitment to sustainability, which is one of the tenets of its strategy. imagin's entire business model and organisation is committed to adhering to standards of coherence, driving positive social and environmental change, transparency and innovation.

Furthering this commitment, imagin has launched a new campaign to entice people to direct deposit their salary with sustainability incentives.. This June, for every user who direct deposits their salary, imagin will help remove 10kg of plastics and other ocean waste. imagin is particularly active in initiatives relating to the conservation of seas and oceans, one of the main areas of its environmental action. In recent months, more than a tonne of sea waste has been collected with imagin's Seabins, the floating marine containers that it has installed in different Spanish ports and with are expected to collect up to 10 tonnes of sea waste every year.

Forest protection is another key area in which imagin hopes to have a positive impact on the planet. Last week, as part of the third edition of the imaginPlanet Tour, two influencers biked more than 150 kilometres around the island of Mallorca to promote sustainable spaces and projects on the island. For every kilometre travelled, imagin will plant a tree in a forest in the Valle de Iruelas (Ávila), which in 2019 suffered a fire that severely affected the area's tree cover and its ecosystem. This initiative saw the participation of over 70,000 users in the Strava community.

imagin's commitment to sustainability has allowed the platform to receive the B Corp seal, which certifies the organisation's compliance with the strictest standards for social and environmental matters, public transparency, and corporate social responsibility to balance financial profits with social goals.

3.7 million imaginers

imagin is a lifestyle platform powered by CaixaBank that offers digital, financial and non-financial services to help its users, mainly people under 30, in their daily lives and future projects. It currently has a community of 3.7 million users, a figure that is constantly growing thanks to the wide range of content and services on offer, largely for free.

GERMAN LOGISTICS PARK REDUCES CO2 EMISSIONS BY 33% WITH ECOPACT,"Real estate developer SEGRO used ECOPact green concrete to revitalize a former coal mining area in Germany by building a new logistics park on the site. The project delivered 825 tons of CO2 savings, or a reduction of 33% compared to the German industry reference.

33% of CO2 emissions saved - or a total of 825 tons, equal to the same number of flights from Frankfurt to New York

With the help of ECOPact, the client hopes to obtain the German Sustainable Building Council's (DGNB) Platinum and Climate Positive certificate

9,500 m-3 of ECOPact green concrete fulfilled the client's resource-saving, recycled and low-carbon building materials requirements

THE CHALLENGE

The new state-of-the-art SEGRO Logistics Park Oberhausen , located in the heart of Germany's Ruhr region, is a new revitalization project on a former coal-mining site. Its total area covers 21 hectares, or the equivalent of about 30 football fields, with a storage area of about 120,000 square meters. Its buildings have all been designed according to the latest standards for sustainable, ecological and energy-conscious construction.

With this project, SEGRO wanted to make an impression for sustainability, aiming for their first German Sustainable Building Council's (DGNB) Platinum and Climate Positive sustainability certificates. Given these ambitions, SEGRO aimed to use as much resource-saving, recycled and low-carbon building materials from the region as possible.

THE SOLUTION

Holcim Germany proposed using ECOPact, the world's broadest range of low-carbon concrete, offering 30% to 100% less carbon emissions compared to standard (CEM I) concrete. Even better, ECOPact was produced in the nearby Oberhausen operations, which optimized transport efficiency and thereby further decreased the environmental footprint.

Holcim delivered a total of 9,500 m-3 of ECOPact, of which 7,500 m-3 consisted of ECOPact with steel fibers, designed for loads from forklift traffic with a maximum of approximately 5 tons. The remaining 2,000 m3 were used for the foundation and other building elements.

THE RESULT

Thanks to ECOPact, a total of 825 tons of CO2 were saved in Oberhausen, equal to the same number of flights from Frankfurt to New York . This represents an emissions reduction of 33% compared to the German industry reference. The ECOPact formula with steel fibers also enabled the reduction of the reinforcement by 40%, helping SEGRO to reduce the dead weight of construction and speed up the project.

'SEGRO wants to become climate-neutral by 2030. The use of Holcim's green concrete helps us a lot because indirect CO2 emissions are one of our biggest challenges. Reducing these emissions not only helps us to achieve our climate targets, but is also a good argument in exchanges with municipalities and tenants.'

A novel process to capture and convert CO2 from air,"Credit: Shutterstock/Dmitry Kovalchuk

As CO 2 emissions continue to grow, the world is becoming ever more reliant on the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to achieve urgent climate targets. Direct air capture (DAC) is a promising novel technology for the extraction of carbon dioxide from ambient air via liquid or solid sorbents. The CO 2 provided by this process can be either stored in geological formations or used as feedstock for the production of carbon-neutral fuels and energy carriers. For his PhD-research, Francesco Sabatino designed and optimized processes for the production of synthetic natural gas from carbon dioxide captured from air and renewable hydrogen.

The necessary growth of renewable energies calls for the development of measures to balance the inherent fluctuations associated with sources such as solar and wind energy. In this regard, power-to-X (PtX) is often brought up when discussing the future renewable energy system. PtX refers to technologies that convert electricity into a variety of fuels or energy carriers through a two-step process. Hydrogen is initially produced via water electrolysis and converted to a gaseous or liquid energy carrier by synthesis with CO or CO 2 . The chemical bonds of these carriers would provide a very efficient and scalable way to store and transport large amounts of renewable energy.

Moreover, the complete decarbonization of our society will not take place overnight, with some sectors (such as aviation) requiring a crucial technological leap to become fully independent from carbon sources. The utilization of dense energy carriers produced from atmospheric carbon and renewable hydrogen would reduce or even eliminate the emissions of distributed and difficult to decarbonize sources such as the one associated with the transport sector.

Direct air capture

Direct air capture (DAC) is still a very expensive technology with a high potential for improvement. The high cost of current DAC processes would place a considerable weight on the economics of any CO 2 capture and utilization system. Therefore, the first objective of Sabatino's PhD research was to optimize DAC processes in order to reduce their costs. In collaboration with his team, he investigated the most mature and effective DAC processes, which capture CO 2 via aqueous solutions of potassium hydroxide or through adsorption on different solid materials. In addition, he also designed new processes based on electrochemical technologies, which are particularly interesting as they can be easily integrated with renewable energy sources, since the only energy input is electricity. Sabatino simulated these systems with detailed process models and optimized their performance through genetic algorithms.

Sabatino used data retrieved from patents or published papers to accurately simulate these processes and validate my models. ""I found that all technologies have the potential to achieve costs lower than 200 $/ton CO 2 , thanks to rigorous optimization and smart design. However, processes adopting solid-sorbents generally perform better, provided that high mass transfer rates are achieved.""

Optimal processing

The second objective of his research was to identify an optimal process integration between DAC and the methanation of carbon dioxide. The sorbent regeneration requires considerable energy, while the reaction of CO 2 with hydrogen is exothermic, that is, it releases heat. Sabatino investigated different integration strategies to identify and quantify the synergies that can arise from a smart combination of CO 2 capture and its conversion. He developed a kinetic model to describe the adsorption and desorption of carbon dioxide on potassium carbonate and implemented it in an existing reactor model.

Sabatino found that a great reduction of the energy demand can be achieved through efficient heat integration. Generally, overall auto-thermal operation can attained, meaning that no external heat has to be provided to the DAC units. Moreover, a novel and intensified process in which the capture and conversion of the carbon dioxide are carried out in the same reactor provided the best results, thanks to a more efficient heat integration and avoidance of CO 2 compression.

Minnesota utility regulators vote Thursday whether to regulate CO2 pipelines,"Minnesota utility regulators on Thursday will likely decide whether two planned carbon dioxide pipelines should be classified as ""hazardous,"" and thus regulated.

The multistate pipelines would transport carbon dioxide captured at ethanol plants, including eight in Minnesota. CO2 is considered a hazardous pipeline material under federal law and in some states, but not Minnesota.

In December, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) opened an inquiry into the two multibillion-dollar pipelines, which also cross neighboring states, particularly Iowa. If the PUC opts to regulate the pipelines, both would require the commission's approval.

Currently, individual counties would have to approve both pipelines.

Several state agencies have submitted comments to the PUC favoring regulation, including the departments of public safety, commerce and transportation.

""All of Minnesota, including state agencies, rely on the robust regulatory process that the commission provides, and carbon capture projects that fall within the correct size category should be no exception,"" the Transportation Department said in PUC filing.

The Midwest Carbon Express, proposed by Ames, Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions, would run for 150 miles in Minnesota, connecting to seven ethanol plants. The Heartland Greenway, proposed by Texas-based Navigator CO2 Ventures, would jog 12 miles into Minnesota, linking to one ethanol plant.

The companies would store carbon dioxide deep underground — below drinking water aquifers — in North Dakota for Summit, and in Illinois for Navigator.

Environmental groups, Indian bands and several citizens have also weighed in on the side of PUC oversight.

The Upper Sioux Community, which is nearby one proposed pipeline, said in a PUC filing that it ""believes that further review is necessary by the state to ensure the preservation of human, animal and plant health for this generation and future generations.""

In a filing, Navigator CO2 said the state's current regulatory scheme is adequate and PUC intervention now would delay and possibly jeopardize its project. Summit questioned whether the PUC has the authority to modify its own rules, saying that's the Legislature's responsibility.

""The current statutory definitions of [a] pipeline do not suggest the Legislature considered CO2 a hazardous liquid for the purposes of pipeline regulation,"" Summit said in a PUC filing.

There are only about 5,000 miles of U.S. carbon dioxide pipelines — a fraction of the nation's 2.6 million miles of natural gas, oil and petroleum products pipelines. CO2 pipelines mostly ship natural forming underground CO2 to oil fields, where it's used to extract hard-to-get crude.

CO2 is heavier than air, so if a pipeline ruptures, it can collect in low-lying areas and displace oxygen. It's a potential asphyxiant and can cause breathing difficulties, rapid heartbeat, vomiting, headaches and impaired thinking.

The worst U.S. accident on a CO2 line appears to have occurred in 2020 near Satartia, Miss. A 24-inch pipeline owned by an oil and gas company ruptured, leading to the evacuation of more than 300 people. Forty-six were treated for injuries at local hospitals.

Still, the Great Plains Institute, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit energy research group, said in a PUC filing that there's never been a fatality from a CO2 pipeline accident — and that risks can be avoided if a pipeline is properly sited.

The Great Plains Institute argued against deeming CO2 as hazardous, saying such a classification could hinder the development of carbon capture projects — which are vital to address climate-change goals.

Some other clean energy and environmental groups, however, are skeptical of carbon capture, saying it prolongs the lifespan of CO2-emitting power and fuel production.

Ethanol plants produce copious amounts of CO2, but it is particularly pure. That makes it easier and more cost efficient to sequester than CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plant emissions.

Still, numerous federal tax credits are needed to make the two CO2 pipeline projects feasible.",,[],"['Mike Hughlett', 'Mike.Hughlett Startribune.Com']"

Converting CO2 to formic acid,"In recent years, CO2 emissions arising from the consumption of fossil fuels have become a severe problem. Among various proposed methods and schemes to address this problem, photocatalytic CO2 reduction is expected to be a key technology in the future.

Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into transportable fuels such as formic acid (HCOOH) is an attractive solution. To aid in this mission, a research team from Tokyo Tech developed a catalyst that can efficiently convert CO2 into HCOOH with ~90% selectivity! It is a first-of-its-kind-of iron-based solid catalyst that can generate HCOOH when accompanied by an effective photosensitizer.

Solid catalysts are considered best for this task because of their efficiency and potential recyclability. Over the years, scientists have explored the catalytic abilities of many cobalt, manganese, nickel, and iron-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). However, most iron-based catalysts reported thus far only yield carbon monoxide as the main product instead of HCOOH.

Scientists from the Tokyo Institute of Technology have solved this problem by presenting alumina (Al2O3)-supported, an iron-based catalyst that uses alpha-iron(III) oxyhydroxide (α-FeOOH; goethite). The new α-FeOOH/Al2O3 catalyst showed superior CO2 to HCOOH conversion properties alongside excellent recyclability.

Prof. Kazuhiko Maeda, the study’s lead author, said, “We wanted to explore more abundant elements as catalysts in a CO2 photoreduction system. We need a solid catalyst that is active, recyclable, non-toxic, and inexpensive, which is why we chose a widespread soil mineral-like goethite for our experiments.”

To synthesize their catalyst, scientists used the iron-loaded Al2O3 material for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 at room temperature in the presence of a ruthenium-based (Ru) photosensitizer, an electron donor, and visible light of wavelength over 400 nanometers. Their system showed 80-90% selectivity towards the main product, HCOOH, and a quantum yield of 4.3%.

Prof. Maeda said, “The insights from this research could aid in developing new catalysts—free of precious metals—for the photoreduction of CO2 into other useful chemicals. Our study shows that the road to a greener energy economy doesn’t have to be complicated. Great results can be attained even by adopting simple catalyst preparation methods. Well-known, earth-abundant compounds can be used as selective catalysts for CO2 reduction if they are supported by compounds like alumina.”

CO2: Major UK fertiliser plant to permanently close,"As natural gas prices continue to skyrocket, CF Fertilisers (CFF) - one of the UK’s largest fertiliser production companies - has announced that it will permanently close its Ince manufacturing facility near Chester.

US fertiliser group CF Industries revealed that the closure is due to a restructuring plan that will focus exclusively on manufacturing operations at its Billingham facility in Teesside.

Supplying fertiliser for farmers and CO2 for the food and drink industries, the company is a major player in the UK’s food supply chain, having been responsible for producing 60% of the country’s CO2.

Having worked with the UK Government on a three-month price-fixing support plan in September 2021, CFF was able to guarantee that critical industries such as food processing and nuclear power are ensured supplies of CO2 by maintaining operations at Billingham.

Following the deal’s expiration in January of this year, a new agreement signed between the two parties saw CFF’s Billingham plant continue to operate while global gas prices remained high, abating the immediate fears over CO2 shortages.

Read more: Fresh fears sparked over food and drink shortages

The permanent closure of the Ince plant – which hasn’t reopened since halting operations in September 2021 – and restructuring of its UK operations will likely see the loss of around 350 jobs.

An unprofitable venture

Due to the dependency of the global nitrogen industry on natural gas – the primary fuel source and raw material for ammonia production – global nitrogen industry conditions are expected to remain challenging for nitrogen producers in the UK and Europe, according to CFF.

Having seen its AN fertiliser sales volume to domestic customer plummet by nearly 30% since the 2017-18 season due to high competition from lower-cost imports, CFF turned to exporting at ‘unsustainably’ low margins to continue operations at both its facilities.

Anticipating higher carbon costs, CFF has stated that it intends to fulfil the current domestic demand for AN by limiting its production to the Billingham facility, which the company deems ‘best positioned’ for the longer term.

Commenting on the decision, Brett Nightingale, Managing Director, CFF UK, said, “Following a strategic review of our business, we believe that the best way to continue our legacy of serving customers in the UK is to operate only the Billingham manufacturing facility moving forward while addressing cost pressures throughout our business,” he added.

The company stated that Billingham had the capacity to produce enough fertiliser and other products to meet all forecast domestic customer demand.

Disruption to industry and future resilience

Last year’s CO2 supply concerns sparked fears over food and drink shortages. Some companies in the UK food and drinks industry said that they were reduced to just ten to 15 days of CO2 left, according to reports released in September 2021.

With CO2 used heavily in the meat industry for slaughter of pigs and poultry, Nick Allen, CEO, British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), told gasworld today that the closure of Ince is unlikely to affect the meat industry.

“We’re assured by CFI that there will be no disruption to CO2 supplies to the meat industry,” he said.

“However, the closure of one of only a handful of facilities in the UK means that future supplies will become somewhat less secure, particularly if something were to go wrong with the remaining plant at Billingham.”

“This plant closure means that we are becoming more dependent on individual points in the supply chain.”

How could the UK diversify its CO2 supply?

As part of the deal signed earlier this year between the Government and industry, plans were discussed to build long-term resilience to ensure protection of the UK’s CO2 supply.

Having one or two domestic sources for the UK based on ammonia or bioethanol is dangerous.

With the number of potential domestic CO2 sources dwindling, alternative sources could come from the biogas production process.

Economic opportunities are presented for industrial-grade CO2 from biogas plants for sectors such as welding, blasting services, and chemical feedstock, which makes up around 40% of all demands in many developed markets.

In times of season or price-induced shortage, biogas could alleviate some of the pressure felt in the CO2-intensive food and drink sector.

Earlier this year, BioCarbonics - one of the UK’s main suppliers of ‘green’ CO2 - stated that diversification of domestic sources could play a key role in reducing shortages.

”Having one or two domestic sources for the UK based on ammonia or bioethanol is dangerous.”

”Both of these industries have become volatile over the past 10 years, and have led to numerous supply shortages across the globe and this will not get any better going forward.”

“BioCarbonics believes that the development of networks of small CO2 sources is a stronger supply model than relying on one or two large plants for supply. This ‘distributed’ model is inherently more reliable, and we are building our business and customer base based on this strength, not based on a voltatile underlying industry,” the statement concluded.",,[],['Anthony Wright']
Farmers in England will bury burnt wood in fields to capture CO2,"A large trial is underway to see how much CO2 can be removed from the atmosphere by burying a charcoal-like material in fields

Biochar, charcoal produced from agricultural waste products, before it is applied to soil Matthew Bentley/Alamy

Farmers in England are starting to bury a charcoal-like material in their fields to see if it could offer a new large-scale way of putting the brakes on climate change.

Biochar is the carbon-rich material left over from burning wood and other biomass at high temperatures in an oxygen-free environment. Most of its use today is at the small scale, such as gardeners using it as a fertiliser.

However, a team led by Colin Snape at the University of Nottingham, UK, has started burying up to 200 tonnes of biochar in fields to gauge if it could help meet the UK’s net-zero goal by removing millions of tonnes of carbond dioxide from the atmosphere. It is the biggest biochar trial yet in the UK, and one of several CO2 removal ideas in a £31.5 million research programme, including scattering rock dust on fields and planting more trees.

“The key thing is that all of these greenhouse gas removal technologies, we need to test their viability. We need to figure out how big a slice of the pie biochar is. It’s about not putting all our eggs into one basket, of one magical technology that will save us,” says Genevieve Hodgins, who is managing the biochar project.

Around 15 tonnes of biochar is in the ground already, and more farmers are being recruited across the Midlands region of England this spring and summer to begin widespread burials this autumn. Beyond tackling climate change, a big attraction for farmers is that research indicates biochar can improve soil health, which is in a parlous state in England.

The project will measure how soil health changes over time, including the health of earthworms, as well how it affects crop yield and crop health compared with control plots. Some of the biochar will also be buried on land where tree-planting is planned, in order to see how it affects tree growth. Because the forested areas aren’t used to produce food for human consumption, far more biochar can be put in the ground there: Snape estimates about 50 to 100 tonnes per hectare compared with 10 tonnes for arable land.

Snape says that if the idea were scaled up for widespread deployment across the UK, the biochar would preferably be made from dried-out food waste and waste products from sawmills. However, to ease regulatory approvals by the UK Environment Agency for their trials, the researchers are using biochar made from virgin wood for now, mostly from one producer in Derby.

For the purposes of locking away carbon, that virgin wood would ideally have other uses, such as making timber-framed buildings, which the UK government’s climate advisers say should become more prevalent. Hodgins is looking at alternatives for making biochar, including coconut husks from Germany.

The project should give us a better idea of just how much CO2 biochar can remove. Snape thinks the approach could one day store a “few million” of the 130 million tonnes a year that the Royal Society calculates will need to be removed by 2050. First results may come in autumn 2023, potentially offering new insights into how permanent the removals are by showing how much microbes degrade the biochar.

Ultimately, Snape thinks biochar will be a minor player in the big picture of an emerging suite of ways to remove CO2. But he says it is ready here and now and it doesn’t require huge new infrastructure, such as the pipelines and underground reservoirs to store greenhouse gas in other suggested initiatives. Moreover, he say it is easy for the public to understand. “It’s something that looks like coal going back into the ground. People understand that coal, oil and gas came out of the ground and created the state we’re in today.”",,[],"['Author.Fullname', 'Adam Vaughan']"

LaDuke: CO2 pipelines are another bad idea,"We humans are making too much carbon. Yup it’s us. The percentage of carbon in the air is at about 400 parts per million; carbon is what causes catastrophic storms, facilitates the movement of crazy insects, and basically lets all hell break loose.

And there’s more crazy to come.

The easiest way to stop the carbon buildup is to quit burning fossil fuels, move to efficiency, green building and renewables. That’s the actual solution. Then take something that needs carbon — such as plants — and let them rock nature. Forests love carbon, but you have to keep them, not cut them. And then there’s hemp! That stuff can suck up carbon like nobody’s business, eight times faster than trees. It’s sort of a miracle plant.

Instead of the common sense approach, there’s an even more crazy idea now, an awfully expensive set of experimental technologies: sequestering collected carbon emissions by converting them to a combination liquid and gas (CO2) and putting it in a pipeline to transport it in a potentially high explosive state. Then put this stuff back underground, in what’s called carbon capture and storage.

Scenario 1: You build some more dangerous pipelines, make a big legal battle with farmers, ranchers and Native people, arrest us, and explain why we should bear the risk for the latest bad idea and some more fat cat profits.

The Midwest Carbon Express, owned by Ames, Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions, and The Heartland Greenway, set up by Texas-based Navigator CO2 Ventures, want to run their proposed CO2 lines through the Northern Plains, and Minnesota in what would become part of a much larger network of CO2 pipelines. They would, according to the project proponents, connect ethanol refineries and other vaguely mentioned “industrial sources” in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota.

While the pipelines push ahead in the Dakotas, the companies hit a bump in their road to profits in Minnesota with state regulators. The Carbon Express would run through 150 miles of Minnesota, connecting to seven ethanol plants. The Heartland project would link 12 miles into Minnesota to connect an ethanol plant near Fairmont. North Dakota and South Dakota would take the brunt of the pipelines, as they are heading to the Bakken, where the carbon pipeline will be used to get more oil out of the ground and make more carbon. Crazy.

Why should we be concerned? Well, it’s a big expensive experiment with us all, and our planet. CO2 pipes can explode – they already have – and it’s full of bad math and made-up ideas. That’s why it’s a good thing that the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission decided to take a look, despite industry trying to skirt regulation. The PUC recently voted unanimously to regulate carbon dioxide pipelines as hazardous, which will require the Midwest Carbon Express and The Heartland Greenway to get PUC approval. That rule-making process could take years. Not a good thing for investors in these two multi-Billion-dollar projects.

Of course, pipeline companies always fight such regulation, it’s their general M.O. We saw that with Line 3 and we’re seeing it again, another case where the pipeline industry puts investor profits above public safety and just common sense. While there is much more to this complicated story, keep these key issues top of mind, as the Bold Alliance attorney Paul Blackburn and colleagues note at the Pipeline Fighters Hub blog .

One, the “free oil market” is incentivized by “45Q tax credit. That’s our public money. As Blackburn explains, this “gives polluters who emit carbon dioxide a tax credit if they capture carbon dioxide from their smokestacks, turn it into a fluid, transport it in a pipeline to a well, and then pump it underground.” But something has to power that pipeline — and that means burning more fossil fuels and using more energy to get rid of this latest bad idea. And that means more carbon dioxide (Enbridge is already the largest energy consumer in Minnesota).

Second, companies are using this CO2 process to get out more oil, and that means yet more carbon. It’s called enhanced oil recovery, which “can squeeze very large amounts of oil out of old oilfields and be turned into fuels such as gasoline and diesel and then sold and burned, thereby releasing more CO2 pollution — just the opposite of what the 45Q tax credit is supposed to accomplish, “ Blackburn explains. Hypocritical and really bad math.

An Alternate Scenario: Just grow hemp. Plants love carbon, and instead of spending another $100 billion on crazy techno fixes, common sense would say protect forests and biodiversity because that’s where the “carbon sinks” are. And grow plants: The U.S. has 300 million acres of cropland. Regenerative farming has the potential to 100% offset U.S. C02 emissions and rebuild topsoil. It’s time to grow a new green hemp economy. Go organic. and quit doing dumb, expensive and heartbreaking stuff to make a buck. Let’s just have the New Green Revolution, put the carbon back in the soil, and grow our future.

Using bacteria to accelerate CO2 capture in oceans,"Berkeley Lab researcher Peter Agbo was awarded a grant for a carbon capture project under the Lab’s Carbon Negative Initiative. Credit: Marilyn Sargent/Berkeley Lab

You may be familiar with direct air capture, or DAC, in which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere in an effort to slow the effects of climate change. Now a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has proposed a scheme for direct ocean capture. Removing CO 2 from the oceans will enable them to continue to do their job of absorbing excess CO 2 from the atmosphere.

Experts mostly agree that combating climate change will take more than halting emissions of climate-warming gases. We must also remove the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that have already been emitted, to the tune of gigatons of CO 2 removed each year by 2050 in order to achieve net zero emissions. The oceans contain significantly more CO 2 than the atmosphere and have been acting as an important carbon sink for our planet.

Peter Agbo is a Berkeley Lab staff scientist in the Chemical Sciences Division, with a secondary appointment in the Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division. He was awarded a grant through Berkeley Lab's Carbon Negative Initiative, which is aiming to develop breakthrough negative emissions technologies, for his ocean capture proposal. His co-investigators on this project are Steven Singer at the Joint BioEnergy Institute and Ruchira Chatterjee, a scientist in the Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division of Berkeley Lab.

Q. Can you explain how you envision your technology to work?

What I'm essentially trying to do is convert CO 2 to limestone, and one way to do this is to use seawater. The reason you can do this is because limestone is composed of magnesium, or what's called magnesium and calcium carbonates. There's a lot of magnesium and calcium naturally resident in seawater. So if you have free CO 2 floating around in seawater, along with that magnesium and calcium, it will naturally form limestone to a certain extent, but the process is very slow—borderline geologic time scales.

It turns out that the bottleneck in the conversion of CO 2 to these magnesium and calcium carbonates in seawater is a process that is naturally catalyzed by an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. It's not important to know the enzyme name; it's just important to know that when you add carbonic anhydrase to this seawater mixture, you can basically accelerate the conversion of CO 2 to these limestones under suitable conditions.

And so the idea is to scale this up—drawing CO 2 out of the atmosphere into the ocean and ultimately into some limestone product that you could sequester.

Q. Fascinating. So you want to turn carbon dioxide into rock using a process that occurs naturally in seawater, but accelerating it. This sounds almost like science fiction. What are the challenges in getting this to work?

To absorb CO 2 from the air quick enough for the technology to work, you have to solve the problem of how to provide enough of this enzyme that you could deploy this process at a meaningful scale. If we were to simply try to supply the enzyme as a pure product, you couldn't do it in an economically viable way. So the question I'm trying to answer here is, how would you do this? You also have to find ways of stabilizing the pH and mixing in enough air to raise and maintain your CO 2 concentration in water.

The solution that occurred to me was, okay, given that we know carbonic anhydrase is a protein, and proteins are naturally synthesized by biochemical systems, such as bacteria, which we can manipulate, then we could take bacteria and then engineer them to make carbonic anhydrase for us. And you can just keep growing these bacteria as long as you feed them. One problem, though, is that now you've shifted the cost burden onto supplying enough food to produce enough bacteria to produce enough enzyme.

One way around this issue would be to use bacteria that can grow using energy and nutrients that are readily available in the natural environment. So this pointed towards photosynthetic bacteria. They can use sunlight as their energy source, and they can also use CO 2 as their carbon source to feed on. And certain photosynthetic bacteria can also use the minerals that naturally occur in seawater essentially as vitamins.

Q. Interesting. So the path to capturing excess CO 2 lays in being able to engineer a microbe?

Potentially one way, yes. What I've been working on in this project is to develop a genetically modified bacterium that is photosynthetic and is engineered to produce a lot of carbon anhydrase on its surface. Then, if you were to put it in seawater, where you have a lot of magnesium and calcium, and also CO 2 present, you would see a rapid formation of limestone. That's the basic idea.

It's a small project for now, so I decided to focus on getting the engineered organism. Right now, I'm simply trying to develop the primary catalyst system, which are the enzyme-modified bacteria to drive the mineralization. The other non-trivial pieces of this approach—how to appropriately design the reactor to stabilize CO 2 concentrations and pH needed for this scheme to work—are future challenges. But I've been using simulations to inform my approaches to those problems.

It's a fun project because on any given day my co-PIs and I could be doing either physical electrochemistry or gene manipulation in the lab.

Q. How would this look once it's scaled up? And how much carbon would it be able to sequester?

What I have envisioned is, the bacterium would be grown in a plant-scaled bioreactor. You basically flow seawater into this bioreactor while actively mixing in air, and it processes the seawater, converting it to limestone. Ideally, you probably have some type of downstream centrifugation process to extract the solids, which maybe could be driven by the flow of water itself, which then helps to pull out the limestone carbonates before you then eject the depleted seawater. An alternative that could possibly resolve the pH constraints of mineralization would be to implement this instead as a reversible process, where you also use the enzyme to reconvert the carbon you've captured in seawater back to a more concentrated CO 2 stream (carbonic anhydrase behavior is reversible).

What I've calculated for this system, assuming that the protein carbonic anhydrase behaves on the bacterial surface, more or less, the way it does in free solution, would suggest that you would need a plant that has only about a 1-million-liter volume, which is actually quite small. One of those could get you to roughly 1 megaton of CO 2 captured per year. A lot of assumptions are built into that sort of estimate though, and it's likely to change as work advances.

Erecting 1,000 such facilities globally, which is a small number compared to the 14,000 water treatment facilities in the United States alone, would permit the annual, gigaton-scale capture of atmospheric CO 2 .",,[],"['Julie Chao', 'Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory']"
Carbon capture system sequesters record amounts of CO2 for direct air capture,"A new carbon capture system that removes carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the air has been developed by Tokyo Metropolitan University researchers, who say it has “unprecedented” performance compared to alternatives.

Isophorone diamine (IPDA) in a “liquid-solid phase separation” system was found to remove carbon dioxide at the low concentrations contained in the atmosphere with 99 per cent efficiency. The researchers said that the compound is reusable with minimal heating and at least twice as fast as existing systems.

While the world is currently trying to reduce its carbon emissions to net zero, scientists are also looking at ultimately removing CO2 that has already been released in order to bring levels down to those found in the pre-industrial era.

Currently, many hurdles remain before carbon capture technologies can be deployed at scale. The biggest challenges come from efficiency, particularly in processing atmospheric air directly in direct air capture (DAC) systems.

The concentrations of CO2 are such that chemical reactions with sorbents are very slow. It has also proven difficult to get the CO2 out again in more sustainable capture-and-desorption cycles, which can be very energy intensive in themselves.

Even leading efforts to build DAC plants, such as those using potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, suffer serious efficiency issues and recovery costs.

The researchers have been studying a class of DAC technology known as liquid-solid phase separation systems. Many DAC systems involve bubbling air through a liquid, with a chemical reaction occurring between the liquid and the CO2.

As the reaction proceeds, more of the reaction product accumulates in the liquid which makes subsequent reactions slower and slower. But liquid-solid phase separation systems offer a solution to this problem as the reaction product is insoluble and comes out of solution as a solid. There is no accumulation of product in the liquid, and the reaction speed does not slow down as much.

The team focused their attention on liquid amine compounds, modifying their structure to optimise reaction speed and efficiency with a wide range of concentrations of carbon dioxide in air, from around 400ppm to up to 30 per cent.

They found that an aqueous solution of one of these compounds, isophorone diamine (IPDA), could convert 99 per cent of the carbon dioxide contained in the air to a solid carbamic acid precipitate.

It was then demonstrated that the solid dispersed in solution only required heating to 60°C to completely release the captured CO2, recovering the original liquid.

The rate at which carbon dioxide could be removed was at least twice as fast as that of the leading DAC lab systems, making it the fastest carbon dioxide capture system in the world at present for processing low concentration carbon dioxide in air (400ppm), the researchers said.",,[],['E T Editorial Staff']

The Many Spheres in Which CO2 Chambers Show Their Strengths,"Without CO 2 incubators, there would be no coronavirus vaccines today. They are also absolutely essential for cancer research. These multiple uses help save lives and cure many different diseases. We would now like to introduce you to some of the interesting facets of CO 2 incubators.

Sponsored by BINDER GmbH.

Regenerative Medicine

CO 2 incubators are being used to conduct research in laboratories across the globe. The Bioscience Institute Middle East, which is among the world’s leading centers for regenerative medicine, is also using an incubator to process the body’s own cells as well as for plastic surgery applications.

The cells–which are multiplied in an incubator–are also used in tissue repair as well as for orthopedic and dermatological treatments. The Bioscience Institute only uses skin and fat tissue specimens from adult (mature) cells. Using the body’s own–i.e., autologous–cells eliminates the risk of rejection while also preventing the complication of graft-versus-host disease (an unwanted reaction of the donor’s immune cells).

To be even more specific: the CO 2 incubators are predominantly used to incubate stem cells from mesenchyme tissue (undifferentiated connective tissue).

Here is how it works: first, cells are extracted from fat tissue. This process is performed by means of enzymatic disaggregation (separation) using various steps of filtration and centrifugation. The crucial stage here is the expansion, i.e., extracting as many stem cells as possible, which is why it is absolutely essential to create the best possible growth conditions.

Dr. Simona Alfano, a biologist at the Bioscience Institute, explained:

“When incubating the cells, it is vitally important for the selected parameters to remain exactly constant across all levels.”

And this is precisely where the CO 2 chambers from BINDER come into their own–with their reproducible growth conditions, constant climatic conditions, low risk of contamination and high level of safety.

The Coronavirus Pandemic

CO 2 chambers also played an important role during the coronavirus pandemic: firstly, in the development of coronavirus vaccines and, secondly, to test drugs that may be used to treat COVID-19 on cells.

For this work, the major pharmaceutical companies required huge volumes of cells–which they were able to acquire with the aid of an incubator. The newly developed active ingredients were then tested using the cells.

The new vaccines used in the fight against the coronavirus were also repeatedly tested on cells in laboratories and evaluated. An incubator proved to be an essential piece of equipment in a laboratory–particularly during the coronavirus pandemic.

Space Biology

The Institute of Medical Engineering at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts has been carrying out research in the field of space biology. The research team, led by Dr. Fabian Ille, is assisted in its work by a CO 2 chamber.

Cells from a bovine hoof are being incubated inside the cabinet at regular intervals until they are needed for a specific experiment. Recently, the cells were frozen and taken to the French city of Bordeaux by Dr. Simon Wüest and a team of researchers.

The reason behind this trip was that the research team in Lucerne was selected by the European Space Agency (ESA) to take part in parabolic flights over the Atlantic. Shortly before the parabolic flights, which lasted for a total of three hours, the cells were removed from the incubator and moved to flight hardware that had been prepared specifically for this purpose and was under controlled temperature conditions.

The scientists from Lucerne wanted to use the parabolic flights to investigate how the cells respond and adapt to mechanical forces. These findings will help them in future attempts to cultivate cartilage that is of a stronger and better consistency, for example. In other words, it might be possible to remove cells from a patient, reproduce them with this innovative new method, and then use them again in the treatment of human patients.

“Weightless conditions are helping us to make significant progress,” said Dr. Ille, reflecting on the research project so far.

In laboratory tests that have already been carried out, Wüest and Ille have been able to demonstrate in very broad terms that this process could work in the future. In these tests, weightless conditions were simulated using a random position machine. Here again, a CO 2 chamber from BINDER was used.

The Requirements Placed on CO2 Incubators

Safety is the absolute top priority here. 180°C sterilization ensures, for example, that every trial series begins with a clean and fully sterile incubator. What’s more, the fanless design means that germs are not stirred up.

The result is optimal cell growth and absolutely no contamination from airborne germs. A deep-drawn inner chamber without corners or edges also enables the incubator to be cleaned thoroughly with ease. It is therefore no surprise that major pharmaceutical manufacturers choose specifically to put their trust in CO 2 incubators from BINDER.

BINDER CO2 incubators are the perfect combination of a range of solutions–180°C hot air sterilization, rapid control, fixture-free interiors and absolutely zero consumables. For optimal cell growth–safe, reliable, smart, economical–look no further than BINDER.

The 1977 White House climate memo that should have changed the world,"In 1977 Star Wars hit movie theaters, New York City had a blackout that lasted 25 hours, and the Apple II personal computer went up for sale. It was also the year that a remarkable one-page memo was circulated at the very highest levels of US government.

Years before the climate crisis was part of national discourse, this memo outlined what was known – and feared – about the crisis at the time. It was prescient in many ways. Did anyone listen?

By July 1977, President Jimmy Carter had only been in office for seven months, but he had already built a reputation for being focused on environmental issues. For one, by installing solar panels on the White House. He had also announced a national renewable energy plan .

“We must start now to develop the new, unconventional sources of energy we will rely on in the next century,” he said in an address to the nation outlining its main goals.

The climate memo arrived on his desk a few days after the Independence Day celebrations on July 4. It has the ominous title “Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change.”

One of the first thing that stands out is the stamp at the top, partially elided, saying THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN.

The memo’s author was Frank Press, Carter’s chief science adviser and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press was a tall, serious, geophysicist who had grown up poor in a Jewish family in Brooklyn, and was described as “brilliant” by his colleagues. Before working with the Carter administration, he had been director of the Seismological Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, and had consulted for federal agencies including the Navy and NASA.

“Carter had a great respect for Frank [Press] and for science,” said Stu Eizenstat, who served as Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser from 1977 to 1981.

Press starts the memo by laying out the science of the climate crisis as it was understood at the time.

Fossil fuel combustion has increased at an exponential rate over the last 100 years. As a result, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is now 12 percent above the pre-industrial revolution level and may grow to 1.5 to 2.0 times that level within 60 years. Because of the “greenhouse effect” of atmospheric CO2 the increased concentration will induce a global climatic warming of anywhere from 0.5 to 5°C.

These far-sighted assertions were in line with the climate science that originated the previous decade, when the US government funded major science agencies focused on space, atmospheric and ocean science. Research produced for President Lyndon B Johnson in 1965 found that billions of tons of “carbon dioxide is being added to the earth’s atmosphere by the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas”.

Press’s memo was on the mark. In 2021, for the first time ever, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 reached 420PPM, the halfway point to the doubling of pre-industrial CO2 levels that Press posited.

The potential effect on the environment of a climatic fluctuation of such rapidity could be catastrophic and calls for an impact assessment of unprecedented importance and difficulty. A rapid climatic change may result in large scale crop failures at a time when an increased world population taxes agriculture to the limits of productivity.

Press was right. We have indeed seen the catastrophic effects of a climatic fluctuation, in the form of increasingly severe weather events including droughts, heatwaves, and hurricanes of greater intensity. Meanwhile, in many parts of the world heating has already stemmed increases in agricultural productivity, and large-scale food production crises are thought to be possible.

The urgency of the problem derives from our inability to shift rapidly to non-fossil fuel sources once the climatic effects become evident not long after the year 2000; the situation could grow out of control before alternate energy sources and other remedial actions become effective.

This is correct. By the 2000s, the effects of the climate crisis had become apparent in some regions in the form of more deadly heat waves and stronger floods and droughts.

Natural dissipation of C02 would not occur for a millennium after fossil fuel combustion was markedly reduced.

This prediction by Press was actually debunked at least a decade ago. Scientists used to believe that some warming was “baked in”, but scientists have since found that as soon as CO2 emissions stop rising, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 levels off and slowly falls.

As you know this is not a new issue. What is new is the growing weight of scientific support which raises the CO2-climate impact from speculation to a serious hypothesis worthy of a response that is neither complacent nor panicky.

But there were other currents mitigating against the sort of response Press calls for. “​​The story of climate policy in the US, generally, is one missed opportunities and unjustifiable delay,” said Jack Lienke, author of the book Struggling for Air: Power Plants and the “War on Coal.”

Many other issues may have seemed more pressing, or simply better understood. As Lienke writes in Struggling for Air, “At a time when Americans were still dying somewhat regularly in acute, inversion-related pollution episodes, it is unsurprising that legislators were more concerned with the known harms of sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide than the uncertain, seemingly distant threat of climate change.”

The authoritative National Academy of Sciences has just alerted us that it will issue a public statement along these lines in a few weeks.

That public statement, released later that month, emphasized the importance of shifting away from fossil fuel energy and highlighted the urgency of starting to transition to new energy sources as soon as possible: “With the end of the oil age in sight, we must make long-term decisions as to future energy policies. One lesson we have been learning is that the time required for transition from one major source to another is several decades.”

So what happened? When Press’s memo made it to the president’s desk, Jim Schlesinger, America’s first secretary of energy, also attached his own note in response:

​​My view is that the policy implications of this issue are still too uncertain to warrant Presidential involvement and policy initiatives.

Carter seems to have heeded this warning, and did not make much progress on climate crisis mitigation during his presidency. Yet he did sign some significant pieces of environmental legislation, including initiating the first federal toxic waste cleanups and creating the first fuel economy standards.

A significant challenge facing Carter was his own contradictory energy aims. Despite his goal of encouraging alternative energy, he also felt there was a national security interest in boosting US oil production in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis.

“We realized our dependence on foreign oil was dangerous and, very importantly, alternative energy was in its infancy,” Eizenstat said. “So Carter was both doing conservation and still encouraging more domestic oil and gas as a way of reducing dependence on foreign oil,” said Eizenstat. “As with all policy, you have conflicting goals.”

Still, it seems possible that if Carter had been re-elected, the world might have been in a better position regarding climate impacts today. One of the first things Reagan did after winning the election in 1981 was take down the White House solar panels. Meanwhile, the fossil fuel industry – whose scientists were already studying the ways that fossil fuels were changing the climate – started spending tens of millions of dollars sowing doubt about climate science.

Did the Press memo accomplish anything at all? For one person it was in fact a “transformational moment” – this was Eizenstat himself. He says it was instrumental in his own future work on the climate crisis, including his decision in 1997 to serve as the United States’s principal negotiator for the Kyoto global warming protocols.

Those protocols set the stage for the first international effort to tackle climate policy on a global level. So even if Press’s memo had a muted impact at the time, his warning wasn’t entirely ignored.",,[],['Emma Pattee']
Fast food firms' supplier policies 'not fit' to combat water and CO2 risks,"Fast food restaurants are failing to align supplier policies with corporate climate and water commitments, according to a report.

The report, by sustainability non-profit Ceres and ESG investor network Fairr, said firms including McDonald’s and Domino’s had not updated their supplier policies to reflect ESG priorities, leaving them “not fit for purpose”.

Requirements in policies focused on animal welfare, deforestation, food safety, labour rights, and regulatory compliance, but there was little or no emphasis on suppliers’ emissions, water, and land use footprints.

The report said: “The current environmental requirements of supplier policies are not fit for purpose to deliver the GHG emissions reductions and water-related risk mitigation measures urgently needed in agricultural supply chains.”

Companies used language in policies encouraging, rather than requiring, climate and water sustainability.

The six target companies in the report – Chipotle, Domino’s, McDonald’s, Restaurant Brands International (which owns Burger King and Tim Horton’s), Wendy’s, and Yum! Brands (which owns KFC and Pizza Hut) – had adopted greenhouse gas reduction targets approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative, but some had not updated their supplier policies or code of conduct to reflect this.

Other companies had no clear supplier expectations for climate and water risks, only general expectations over climate impact, or a simple expectation of regulatory compliance.

The report said companies must expand their supplier policies to serve as an extension of their own climate and water commitments. They should engage with key suppliers and regularly audit their progress to ensure proactive steps are being taken.

Some brands, such as McDonald’s, had made progress by requiring suppliers to answer CDP’s climate change and forests questionnaires.

The report cited research showing agricultural supply chains are especially vulnerable to climate and water risk. The livestock industry’s reliance on pastures and feeds makes it vulnerable to global warming, which can damage freshwater availability, soil quality, and pollinator health.

Livestock production is the main agricultural emissions source, and leading driver of water depletion and degradation.

The report provided other steps for companies to take to address the “global water crisis”.

1. Board oversight

Fast food brands should disclose actions and the results of efforts to resolve climate and water risks frequently to ther board.

2. Implementation plans

Companies should put into place emissions reduction plans, including the entire animal agricultural supply chain, with alignment between supplier codes of conduct and climate commitments.

3. Water risk

Firms need to conduct comprehensive water risk assessments along their animal protein supply chain. This will help prioritise vulnerable regions. Disclosing the scope and timing of this assessment will also be vital to ensure effectiveness.

4. Water targets

Companies must commit to water-use reduction targets informed by local water supply challenges. Commitment to eliminating pollution in operations by 2025, and throughout the value chain by 2030, is also critical.

​​By promoting agricultural practices with suppliers, such as cover cropping, reduced tillage, agroforestry, and fertiliser optimisation, firms can help farmers improve the water retention of soil, reducing nutrient runoff and enhancing resilience to droughts and flooding.

Evolution Data Centres reveals target of 20 tonnes of CO2 per GWh,"Evolution Data Centres (EvoDC) has launched their new Sustainable Data Centre Charter, which includes targets like only 20 tonnes of carbon emissions per GWh by 2030.

The company says that's compared to a staggering 1263 tonnes of CO2/GWh (used in IT load) if no decarbonisation measures are taken.

EvoDC says it will measure its entire operations against the new set of sustainability standards, aiming to minimise carbon intensity and limit water usage as the company develops in Asia.

To meet this goal, the company has partnered with ENGIE Impact, a leader in sustainability transformation solutions, to ensure independent verification of its environmental commitment.

EvoDC says transparency is critical, and its performance will be made available for an independent assessment to track EvoDC's progress and performance in five key areas: carbon emissions, renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings, as well as water and waste management.

EvoDC chief executive Darren Webb says he's delighted to announce the new sustainability charter.

""This demonstrates our long-term commitment to sustainability and will ensure that we consider the environmental impact of every aspect of our data centre development and operation,"" he says.

""We have deliberately set ourselves ambitious targets and will be held to account by the annual publication of our performance.""

ENGIE managing director for APAC Malavika Jain Bambawale says in order to stay within the world's carbon budget to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, large energy consumers such as data centres must transition to low carbon technologies successfully.

""We are pleased to support EvoDC with their sustainability charter which sets out a clear decarbonisation roadmap for implementation across markets,"" she says.

Evolution Data Centres has its headquarters in Singapore and was founded in 2021 with the strategic vision to become the next-generation, leading pan-Asian data centre platform, delivering digital infrastructure reliably and sustainably into high-growth markets.

"DOE to fund $3.5B program to capture, store CO2 from the air","DOE to fund $3.5B program to capture, store CO2 from the air

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) outlined its plans to fund a $3.5 billion program to capture and store carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution directly from the air.

The funding for the Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program comes through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The program will support four large-scale, regional direct air capture hubs that each comprise a network of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) projects. The widespread deployment of direct air capture technologies and CO2 transport, and storage infrastructure is part of President Joe Biden’s goal of achieving a net-zero economy by 2050.

“The UN’s latest climate report made clear that removing legacy carbon pollution from the air through direct air capture and safely storing it is an essential weapon in our fight against the climate crisis,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said. “President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is funding new technologies that will not only make our carbon-free future a reality but will help position the U.S. as a net-zero leader while creating good-paying jobs for a transitioning clean energy workforce.”

Direct air capture is a process that separates CO2 from ambient air. The CO2 is then permanently stored deep underground or converted for use in products like concrete that prevent its release back into the atmosphere. By midcentury, CDR will need to be deployed at the gigaton scale. To put this in perspective, one gigaton of subsurface sequestered CO2 is equivalent to the annual emissions from the U.S. light-duty vehicle fleet – that’s the equivalent of approximately 250 million vehicles driven in one year.

Each of the projects selected for the Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program will demonstrate the delivery and storage or end use of removed carbon. The hubs must have the capacity to capture and then permanently store at least one million metric tons of CO2 from the atmosphere annually. In the development and deployment of the four regional direct air capture hubs, DOE will also emphasize environmental justice, community engagement, consent-based siting, equity and workforce development, and domestic supply chains and manufacturing.",,[],['Dave Kovaleski']
What is the circular economy and why does it matter?,"In a circular economy, products can be used again and again.

This reduces our use of precious raw materials and cuts CO2 emissions.

Circular economy initiatives include the Circulars Accelerator, an innovation programme run in collaboration with the World Economic Forum.

The way we live now is using 60% more resources than the Earth can provide - and creating too much waste, according to experts.

Switching to a circular economy is widely considered to be the way forward.

What is the circular economy?

In a circular economy, things are made and consumed in a way that minimizes our use of the world’s resources, cuts waste and reduces carbon emissions. Products are kept in use for as long as possible, through repairing, recycling and redesign – so they can be used again and again.

At the end of a product’s life, the materials used to make it are kept in the economy and reused wherever possible, the European Parliament explains.

The circular economy could unlock $4.5 trillion of value by 2030. Image: European Parliament

Why is the circular economy important?

The circular economy is an alternative to traditional linear economies, where we take resources, make things, consume them and throw them away. This way of living uses up finite raw materials and produces vast quantities of waste.

For example, the European Union produces more than 2.5 billion tonnes of waste a year.

Extracting and processing raw materials impacts the environment and increases energy consumption and CO2 emissions.

A circular economy could unlock $4.5 trillion of value by 2030, a report by Accenture estimated.

What changes could make the world more ‘circular’?

Consumers, businesses and politicians all need to make changes.

Examples are set out in The Circularity Gap Report, an annual document on the state of the circular economy, launched at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting in Davos.

Ideas to create less emissions include adopting a plant-based diet and buying food locally, as well as flying less often and sharing vehicles.

Homes, offices and other buildings can be designed to have multiple uses. For example, an office space that is also a community centre and night school.

It should also be easy and affordable to repair products, such as a mobile phone with an old battery.

Is recycling part of the circular economy?

Recycling involves converting waste materials into new materials and objects. This process itself uses energy and creates emissions, so can still contribute to global warming.

In an ideal circular economy, products are redesigned so they last through several life cycles – rather than being immediately recycled.

This can include refurbishing and redistributing products.

How can we build a circular economy?

There are a growing number of circular economy initiatives and technologies already underway.

Examples include the Circulars Accelerator, a six-month programme run by UpLink, the World Economic Forum’s innovation crowdsourcing platform, to help circular economy innovators scale their ideas. In 2022, 17 start-ups are taking part in the programme.

They include Aquacycl, an American company that generates electricity from untreatable waste water; Done Properly, a company in Chile developing sustainable food ingredients and Green Mining, a company in Brazil that recycles consumer packaging.

Scale360° is another Forum circular economy initiative to help technologists, political leaders and entrepreneurs change how products are made and consumed. In Germany, for instance, a campaign is underway to educate consumers on the environmental impact of ‘white goods’ such as fridges and washing machines.

Other companies driving circular economy innovation include Swedish denim brand, Nudie. It offers a lifetime repair service on its jeans, and says it repaired more than 60,000 pairs of jeans in 2019.",,[],"['Victoria Masterson', 'Written By', 'Musaab Almulla', 'Samah El-Shahat', 'Nan Zhou', 'Andrea Willige', 'Felix Richter', 'Tim Forslund']"

RALEIGH. N.C. (AP) — Duke Energy Corp.’s electricity-generating subsidiaries for North Carolina told regulators on Monday how they can comply with a new state law demanding significant greenhouse gas reductions by the end of the decade.

The document filings with the North Carolina Utilities Commission come seven months after Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed bipartisan legislation that directed the utility to lower carbon dioxide emissions 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. Zero-net CO2 emissions would be met by 2050.

The law says the commission, which must rule on an energy path by year’s end, can delay the target years in some circumstances, and three of the four energy-portfolio alterations offered by Charlotte-based Duke Energy extend the date to 2032 or 2034.

Those three portfolios would rely less on solar power and energy-storing batteries and more on nuclear power and offshore wind turbines for emissionless production. They also would result in slightly lower average annual increases on retail power bills for the 4.4 million North Carolina and South Carolina customers through 2035 compared to reaching the 70% reduction in 2030, according to Duke Energy.

Company officials cautioned that the potential annual customer bill increases, ranging from 1.9% to 2.7%, could change and likely would be zero or minimal in the first few years of any plan that regulators approve. Some businesses and advocates for the poor opposed the final legislation because they believed the cost to ratepayers would be much more, or that the law lacked enough monetary assistance for low-income residents.

The portfolio options address energy production shifts by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, which have power plants and serve customers in both states. But the 70% reduction only applies to North Carolina because the law requires it. The utilities will file the plan in 2023 with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina as part of future planning there.

“Customers in North Carolina and South Carolina deserve an orderly energy transition that supports communities and maintains affordable rates, while ensuring the continued reliable service and economic competitiveness on which both states depend,” Duke Energy North Carolina President Stephen De May said in a news release.

The four portfolios envision retiring Duke Energy’s coal-fired power plants located in North Carolina by 2035, in keeping with a companywide announcement in February. The utility has already retired its coal-fired plants in South Carolina. Some that remain in North Carolina serve South Carolina customers.

All of the options rely on an “all of the above” mix to make up for the lost coal-fired power production and address future electricity need. They include grid improvements and energy efficiency; more solar power and battery storage; hydroelectric power storage; an emerging form of small nuclear power plants; and additional natural gas-powered plants, which provide energy on cloudy or high-demand days.

The portfolio that reaches a 70% reduction by 2032 relies more on offshore wind production. Of the two portfolios that reach the reduction by 2034, one emphasizes the use of “small modular reactors,” while the other would rely on nuclear and offshore wind. Additional nuclear likely wouldn’t come online until the early 2030s.

The North Carolina law says the commission can examine “the latest technological breakthroughs to achieve the least cost path,” among other considerations in signing off on a plan. The panel, composed of seven members nominated by Cooper, has the discretion to delay the 2030 target by up to two years, and even longer if regulatory and construction delays for nuclear or wind energy facilities arise, or if the grid’s performance is questioned.

Duke Energy said over 500 people representing more than 300 groups in the two states offered their input and feedback as the options were drafted. The commission will hold public hearings in July and August.

A coalition of environmental and clean energy groups said Monday that it will offer an alternative plan by July 15 that will also focus on equity and environmental justice.

“We may not agree on all the details included in the modeling to reach these goals but are optimistic that this process will lead to a cleaner electricity sector and more jobs across the state,” said Peter Ledford with the NC Sustainable Energy Association, a coalition member.

The law was considered a major regulatory and political accomplishment when enacted in October following negotiations largely between Cooper and state senators from both parties.

Duke is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina, while the two subsidiaries serve roughly a third of South Carolina electricity customers.",,[],['Gary D. Robertson']
CO2 Transmission Into Bulk Drug Substance Containers - BioProcess International,"

Ingress of carbon dioxide into bulk drug substance (BDS) containers that are stored and shipped on dry ice is a serious and often understated problem. Bottles are a container of choice for freezing and shipping BDS due to their durability and convenience, compatibility with standard laboratory equipment, shelving and racking, and standard shipping containers. However, not all bottles are tested for CCI, nor does this testing guarantee leak-free performance once frozen. Carbon dioxide can readily enter bottles either through the sidewall material or, most frequently, through leaks in the closure system. This technical note outlines two studies performed by a major biopharmaceutical company to determine the closure style and torque specification of Purillex® PFA bottles required to ensure no carbon dioxide ingress during storage and shipping of BDS products on dry ice.

A lesson in CO2 levels,"The Gap Cubbyhouse Montessori in Brisbane has created a safer, healthier and more productive childcare learning environment with Internet of Things (IoT) technology from Australian companies Thinxtra and Zeplin.

The solution comprises indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring devices to measure carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, proven to be the best proxy for indoor COVID-19 transmission risk.

The Gap Montessori is a family-owned long day care centre that caters to children between the ages of six weeks to six years.

With extensive background in engineering and scientific methodology, Sue-Ling Lau, director of The Gap Cubbyhouse Montessori, understood the importance of maintaining healthy IAQ for children, their families, and staff.

Once the centre reopened after pandemic lockdowns, Ling Lau recognised the need for an IAQ monitoring solution to reduce the risk of transmission of airborne diseases like COVID-19, and boost the overall health and wellbeing of the Montessori community at The Gap.

“All childcare centres face the same threat of virus transmission, and by knowing the CO2 levels in a room you can not only make informed decisions to minimise COVID-19 transmission but all airborne diseases,” she said.

“It wasn’t enough to just open the windows and get air purifiers; these are crucial, but we needed to understand the baseline of air quality in all parts of the centre.”

Ling Lau partnered with Brisbane-based Zeplin to implement its IAQ Monitoring Solution, comprising IoT sensors that measure CO2, temperature, and humidity levels.

The devices are battery-powered, with a life of up to five years and no ongoing maintenance requirements. The data recorded by the sensors is transmitted in real time over Thinxtra’s national 0G Network, and available to view in Zeplin’s remotely accessible, cloud-based application.

“Since I don’t always work on-site, I wanted a way to see the CO2 levels remotely, and that’s where the Zeplin and Thinxtra system came in,” Ling Lau said.

“It proved a very attractive option as it created visibility into air quality across all indoor spaces, with the ability to access data at any time, plus the benefit of live notifications.”

The Gap Montessori installed IAQ monitoring devices across the venue’s classrooms, offices, and corridors, each with sensors that provide reliable data through Zeplin’s mobile and web applications.

The solution was fully functional within hours, and did not require any dedicated cabling to be implemented.

The centre receives alerts when maximum threshold limits for IAQ are reached, allowing Ling to advise employees working on-site to change the conditions in each respective room.

“Having real-time data on CO2 levels, humidity, and temperature available helps us take the right measures to maintain the health and wellbeing of the children and staff. It lets us know when to open windows, move outside, and even ensure children are hydrated and dressed appropriately in hotter months,” she said.

“Poor ventilation also has an impact on cognitive ability and therefore productivity, so lowering CO2 levels means no one feels tired or groggy, giving us a more optimal learning environment for children.

“It has been quite eye-opening to see the CO2 threshold alerts come through. We did not realise how high CO2 levels could get even in a low-density suburb like The Gap.

“Initially, we were getting alerts several times per day but now need less with procedures in place to increase airflow. Our trigger point is 800 parts per million (ppm) – which is an acceptable level of CO2. Complaints of drowsiness and poor air quality start once CO2 exceeds 1000ppm,” Ling Lau said.

“These levels were surprisingly common at our centre when we first installed the monitors.

“Parents have told me they feel very reassured we’re doing everything we can to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 at our childcare centre, with daily deep cleaning of our facilities, weekly rapid antigen testing for staff, and now the CO2 monitors.”

Zeplin director, Justin Appi, said he discussed setting thresholds with Ling Lau based on recommended standards, giving The Gap Cubbyhouse a solution that triggers alerts based on their preferred attributes which can be adjusted any time.

“Alongside opening windows, using air purifiers, and turning air conditioners to fresh air intake, CO2 monitors are a must-have in day care centres and schools,” he said.

Thinxtra CEO, Nicholas Lambrou, said when it comes to reducing the spread of airborne viruses, it’s incredibly difficult to control something that cannot be seen.

“With Zeplin and Thinxtra, The Gap Montessori has a solution which can monitor indoor air quality that helps the day care centre provide a healthier and safer environment for children and staff; they are able to breathe cleaner air and perform better in well-ventilated spaces that have lowered risks of airborne virus transmission,” Lambrou said.",,[],[]
Advisory on CO2 Monitoring to Assess Ventilation Adequacy,"First released on June 2022





This Advisory Note guides premises managers on how carbon dioxide (CO) monitoring can be used as a proxy for ventilation adequacy, so that premises managers can take timely mitigating measures when ventilation is poor (when COlevels are above 800ppm). Measures to improve ventilation in indoor spaces can be found in the Guidance Note on Improving Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality in Buildings amid the COVID-19 Situation

As Singapore transitions to COVID-19 endemicity, premises managers should take active steps to ensure good ventilation, especially in enclosed, air-conditioned indoor environments. Good ventilation reduces the amount of virus aerosols and other indoor air pollutants that could be present. This will help mitigate the risk of aerosol-based transmission to protect the health of occupants, workers and general public in these premises. Measures to improve ventilation will also enhance our resilience against new COVID-19 variants of concern and future airborne infectious disease threats.

Ensuring good ventilation is critical in premises with higher risk of aerosol transmission, due to risk factors such as mask-off or bioaerosol-generating activities, prolonged time duration spent by occupants within the space, and/or the presence of vulnerable populations. A list of such higher risk premises is shown below. Managers of such premises should proactively ensure that these premises are always well-ventilated.



Hospitals and clinics

Eldercare facilities, including nursing homes and day activity centres

Establishments with food and drinks served on-site*

Gyms and fitness studios

*Include food establishments, event venues, function rooms, nightlife establishments, karaoke establishments etc.



CO 2 monitoring can be used as a quick, easy-to-implement proxy for ventilation adequacy, and to identify pockets of under-ventilated spaces or overcrowding within the premises. High CO 2 levels imply that there is insufficient outdoor air intake and/or overcrowding, and measures should be taken to improve ventilation or reduce occupancy. Managers of higher risk premises should carry out CO 2 monitoring regularly and take prompt action to improve ventilation, where necessary.",,[],[]

Up to 14% less containership CO2 emissions through Just In Time arrivals,"Containerships can reduce fuel consumption and resulting carbon dioxide emissions by 14% on a per voyage basis using Just In Time (JIT) arrival. It is the first global study into the impact of Just In Time Arrivals using real time tracking and fuel consumption data from container vessels in operation.

Port of Rotterdam has participated in this study by supplying validation data on arrival and departure times. The new study was commissioned by the IMO-Norway GreenVoyage2050’s Global Industry Alliance to Support Low Carbon Shipping (Low Carbon GIA).

Just-In-Time arrivals

Just In Time (JIT) arrivals allow ships to optimise speed during their voyage to arrive in port when berth, fairway and nautical services are available. JIT is an important tool that can contribute to a ship attaining its required carbon intensity indicator (CII) and associated CII rating in accordance with IMO’s short-term GHG reduction measure, which will enter into force later this year. JIT can be taken up, together with other operational measures, in the enhanced Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) which will play a central role in the implementation of IMO’s recent energy efficiency measures.

This latest study, undertaken by MarineTraffic and Energy and Environmental Research Associates (EERA), explores the global implementation of JIT in the container sector. Using AIS data from the calendar year 2019 (pre-pandemic), the impact of JIT on fuel consumption and emissions was assessed by optimizing all voyages in three scenarios:

Over the entire voyage, Over the last 24 hrs, Over the last 12 hrs.

Results

The results show that while optimizing speed over the entire duration of a voyage offers the greatest saving opportunity (displaying a mean fuel saving per voyage of 14.16%), there were benefits in all scenarios with savings of 5.90% (24 hrs scenario) and 4.23% (12 hrs scenario), respectively. This indicates that implementing JIT over the last 12 hours of a voyage can already greatly contribute to fuels and emissions savings.

The Low Carbon GIA is a public-private partnership with the aim to develop innovative solutions to address common barriers to decarbonizing the shipping sector. It has been actively exploring the concept of JIT through various research projects and several industry stakeholder roundtables. In 2020, it published the Just In Time Arrival Guide – Potential Barriers and Solutions, providing guidance to stakeholders towards the implementation of JIT Arrivals.

In-Road Wireless EV Charging Impacts Global CO2 Emissions,"Electreon the leading provider of in-road wireless electric vehicle (EV) charging technology, released a white paper today detailing the projected impact of its technology on global CO2 emission reductions. The research team at Electreon explored four emission-reduction benefits of its wireless EV charging technology that will help decrease current global CO2 emissions by more than 1 percent, on average, through 2030.

The research model takes into consideration projected fleet sizes from 2022 to year-end 2030, specific values found in online and print literature, and estimated emissions produced from Electreon’s operations. The review of the methodology, sources, assumptions, and calculations of Electreon’s research was performed in conjunction with Kenneth Gillingham, professor of economics at the Yale School of the Environment. “The Electreon modeling accurately quantifies the emission reductions possible from widespread adoption of the Electreon technology,” said Professor Gillingham.

The four key benefits of Electreon’s technology that lead to CO2 reductions include:

1. Reduced EV battery sizes: Charging EVs wirelessly through roadways instead of plug-in or connected charging points removes limitations for charging location; enabling charging stations to be deployed wherever needed, including strategically along EV routes as part of wireless Electric Road Systems (ERS) to charge vehicles intermittently with shorter, spread out charging sessions while the vehicles drive. This permits EVs to operate on fewer and smaller batteries, as the batteries no longer need to be large enough to power vehicles for prolonged periods and can instead refill from the road itself without interruptions to driving. This simultaneously delivers extended range, and with EVs able to operate further with fewer/smaller batteries, EV battery kWh production, which has a significant carbon footprint, can be reduced. Battery sizes also impact total vehicle weight, so an EV operating with smaller batteries will be lighter and will emit fewer emissions while in operation.

“This research shows that EVs can only help to drastically cut emissions if they are powered by sustainable solutions like Electreon’s wireless charging technology,” says Oren Ezer, CEO of Electreon. “This effort by our team was inspired by Bill Gates and Breakthrough Energy’s benchmark for companies to reduce global annual emissions by 1%, and which estimates the current total global emissions to be approximately 51 billion tons of CO2 every year. As we deploy Electric Roads Systems all around the world, these metrics will remind our team and partners of our ability to prevent further damage to our planet and achieve our vision of a decarbonized world.”

2. Utilizing renewable (solar) energy for electricity generation: EVs still rely upon the electric grid, which mainly relies on fossil fuel energy sources to supply power during their plug-in charging sessions. Electreon’s wireless charging technology can be easily integrated with off-grid renewable energy sources, alleviating pressure on the electric grid. CO2 emissions are saved through reduced reliance on fossil fuels to power EVs, with EVs receiving a portion of their required electricity from greener, cleaner, energy sources.

3. On-site electricity generation from renewables through existing infrastructure: Indeed, incorporating renewable solar energy to power EVs can help reduce emissions through less reliance on fossil fuels for energy. Coupling this with the use of existing roadway infrastructure – such as median walls and road corridors – to safely mount the required solar panel fences to power a wireless ERS directly on-site will result in even greater CO2 reductions. CO2 emissions are saved through the protection of land acreage and tree populations, often destroyed to make way for large solar farms, as well as reduced manufacturing of large-scale solar facilities.

4. Dynamic charging roads as a shared charging platform: Electreon’s charging technology can wirelessly charge multiple vehicles simultaneously, all via a single management unit. This reduces the demand for private and public plug-in EV chargers, which can only charge one vehicle at a time and whose manufacturing process generates CO2 emissions.

Electreon continues to develop partnerships around the world and stay committed to its goal of wide-scale implementation of wireless EV charging technology to reduce global CO2 emissions. Electreon’s award-winning technology is actively operating pilots in Germany, Italy, Israel and Sweden, and the company is preparing to execute first-of-their-kind pilots in the U.S.

Panasonic CO2 refrigeration makes prime cut,"UK: Keen to increase sustainability in refrigeration at its new butchery in Devon, Riverford Organic Farm is now benefiting from the installation of four 10HP Panasonic CO2 refrigeration units.

Riverford Organic Farm was established in the 1980s and originally delivered fresh vegetables to supermarkets but then realised that there was a unique business model with home delivery – now in 2022, they have built an impressive business, delivering to over 80,000 homes across England and Wales from 36 distribution sites.

Nigel Bower, facilities and property manager at Riverford commented, “We are looking to make significant in-roads by 2030 to drive down our carbon footprint of our activities and in particular the refrigeration and electrical usage that represents 7% of our overall business, we are looking to reduce this with the work we are currently doing especially within our refrigeration requirements.”

Bideford-based contractor Keep It Cool Refrigeration, sought the advice of refrigeration specialist distributor, Mervin Chumun at Hawco Ltd, and together specified four 10HP Panasonic units to provide the best solution for the Riverford Butchery’s hanging, retail, and despatch areas. The Panasonic units supply six Lu-Ve evaporators.

“The main challenge during this project was to keep the rest of the butchery running whilst the expansion was happening,” said Keep It Cool Refrigeration’s operations manager Neil McCourt.

“As the existing site has doubled in size and expanded recently – we are already seeing the benefits in costs. Energy usage is going down and the system is so far performing as we expected to achieve what we wanted to keep a stable environment and reduce our costs – so all good,” commented Nigel Bower. We have 36 other sites that need updating – we are looking at renewables such as CO2 in these sites and currently researching further.”

Neil McCourt further added, “The benefits of using the R744 system are not only for the environment, but also offer greater energy efficiency in addition to the sound of the units being barely noticeable and very quiet, so great for residential areas as you can hardly hear them.”",,[],[]

"PPC’s quarterly profit at plunges on higher energy, CO2 costs","The country’s biggest power utility Public Power Corporation (PPC) reported on Thursday a 24.6% drop in core profit for the first quarter due to higher spending for gas purchases and to offset carbon emissions.

PPC said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at €170 million in the three months to March, down from €225.6 million in the same quarter last year.

The group, which is 34% owned by the state, has offered discounts worth €800 million to households and businesses since last year to help them deal with soaring power bills.

Those discounts came in at €358 million in the first quarter, PPC said.

Despite that cost and soaring gas prices, PPC said its first-quarter performance bode well for meeting its annual target for EBITDA of about €870 million.

The utility plans to invest about €5 billion by 2024 as it seeks to ramp up renewables capacity to at least 7.2 gigawatt by that date and shift away from coal-fired generation.

“We’re already building 355 megawatt (of capacity), including 290 megawatt which are expected to be ready by the end of the year,” Chief Executive Georgios Stassis said. [Reuters]",,[],[]

Data driven methods to boost microalgae production and CO2 capture,"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland is coordinating a two-year research project involving the University of Jyväskylä, Neste and seven Finnish SMEs, jointly addressing some of the bottlenecks in large-scale algal cultivation, as the group explains here.

Microalgae are a promising feedstock for a large number of products such as fuel, food and materials. At the same time, algae are able to fix large amounts of CO2 that they use for growth. Approximately 50% of the algae biomass is carbon, and as such, microalgae hold great potential to support efforts to tackle climate change. However, large-scale algae farming faces technical challenges that hinder widespread economically successful applications.

Project ROBA – Robust Algae Systems, funded by Business Finland, aims to tackle hurdles to create economically feasible algae processes through a combination of modelling, advanced measurement technology, bioprocess engineering, machine learning and synthetic biology.

“Microalgae are one of the potential renewable and scalable future raw materials that Neste is developing, with the aim to expand our renewable raw material pool to support future growth of renewables production. We are also looking for all possible solutions to reduce emissions in order to meet our ambitious goal of carbon neutral production by 2035. Activities in the ROBA project will contribute to these targets by focusing on a concept for refinery CO2 capture with microalgae and by developing monitoring methods that could be utilized in large-scale algae cultivation,” explains Jason Michael Blake, Vice President of Innovation, Business Platform Aviation Feedstock, at Neste.

One bottleneck in algae cultivations to be addressed is monitoring of contamination, which currently is a challenge in large-scale processes and can lead to loss of entire cultures. In ROBA, a series of optical and other online methods will be explored. The measurement technologies to be developed in the project will be applicable also for other biotechnological processes.

“Industrial biotechnology is becoming more and more an important part of sustainable industrial practices. Our aim is to develop intensification methods for large-scale algal cultivation. Innovative measurement and monitoring technologies will help us to move towards efficient and economically feasible production processes,” says Mervi Toivari, Principal Scientist at VTT.

Machine learning promises to take process monitoring even one step further, by combining various information received from the process into a more complete picture.

“This is a new opening to develop a novel on-site observer and computational methods for the needs of microalgae biotechnology. The Spectral Imaging Laboratory at the University of Jyväskylä focuses on developing a non-invasive monitoring method based on hyperspectral imager technology. Monitoring the growth and product accumulation of microalgae and detecting contamination are the key areas for the development,” says Pauliina Salmi, Postdoctoral Researcher from University of Jyväskylä.",,[],[]
"Paving the path to a green future by capturing, storing CO2","As the urgency increases to head off the worst effects of climate change, the airwaves and internet are buzzing with talk about how carbon capture and storage support various strategies to keep excess carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

What’s often missing from the discussion, though, is the science of how it works and how capturing and storing CO2 can make a huge difference as the economy shifts from dependence on oil and gas to renewable alternatives, which won’t happen overnight.

“The fact is, carbon capture and storage underpin just about every path to reining-in climate change and achieving the International Panel on Climate Change goal to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius,” said George Guthrie, a program manager for carbon capture at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Eventually, renewable energy, such as wind and solar, can produce hydrogen, but carbon capture provides the crucial technology for making the transition while renewables ramp up, Guthrie said.

“We can do all of that while maintaining local economies, many of which are based on fossil fuel extraction across the region,” he said. “To make that work we need carbon capture and storage, and we need to stop putting more CO2 into the atmosphere, period.”

Solid foundation in research

Los Alamos and other Department of Energy labs have actively researched carbon capture and storage for decades, including the technology to separate gases from coal and natural-gas plants, take CO2 directly from the atmosphere, and safely store it underground, along with the related geology.

Carbon capture and storage involves two key components, both technically achievable today: capture of CO2 from complex gas mixtures and permanent CO2 storage in underground reservoirs.

“Capture of CO2 at some large industrial sources has been done commercially for decades,” Guthrie said. The technology centers on separating CO2 from other gases as they leave the smokestack. “The DOE has invested in research—including at Los Alamos—to extend CO2 capture technologies to a wider range of operations, such as natural gas power plants and other industrial processes. Commercially available solutions exist today to reduce CO2 emissions from some sources by 90% to 95%.”

These capture technologies can be applied to converting natural gas to low-carbon hydrogen. New technologies go one step further, capturing CO2 directly from the air—a concept born at Los Alamos in the 1990s. Systems are already being tested and deployed commercially today, and the costs are coming down.

The second key component of carbon capture and storage is permanent geologic storage of CO2.

“We know from nature that CO2 can be stored underground for geologic periods. Many of the world’s largest natural deposits of CO2 occur in the intermountain West,” Guthrie said.

One such example is McElmo Dome, a geologic reservoir in southwest Colorado that has naturally accumulated more than 1 billion tons of CO2. Research by Los Alamos, Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico Tech and others has found reservoirs across the nation that could sequester hundreds of billions of tons or more. For comparison, annual emissions in the United States are around 6 to 7 billion tons.

Moving to action under the I-WEST initiative

Moving from research on carbon capture and storage to deployment has gained momentum under the Intermountain West Energy & Transitions initiative. With sponsorship by the DOE, Los Alamos National Laboratory is leading this broadly inclusive initiative that brings together states, regional universities and colleges, research institutions, local communities and Native American nations to create a sustainable-energy economy.

Through a place-based approach using workshops and other outreach that puts people first, I-WEST is learning about stakeholders’ unique concerns and needs regarding jobs, energy use and environmental stewardship. From that input, I-WEST will develop a roadmap to a carbon-neutral economy in the region. It’s already clear that carbon capture and storage will be a key piece of that roadmap.

Earth's CO2 levels to hit alarming milestone,"Data: NOAA and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Chart: Thomas Oide/Axios

Monthly average carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are very likely to hit or even exceed 420 parts per million during the month of April, according to readings at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.

Why it matters: This is a new record high for human history, and very likely the highest level seen in 4.1 million to 4.5 million years.

Scientists tell Axios that the sustained year-to-year growth rates in CO2 concentrations are unprecedented.

Driving the news: The amount of CO2 in the air continues to increase as people burn fossil fuels and chop down rainforests for agriculture, among other activities.

Observations made in the relatively pristine air atop Mauna Loa have taken place since 1958, starting out at 316 ppm.

Context: The data plotting the increase in CO2 is known as the Keeling Curve, named after Charles Keeling, who started and maintained the observations.

Charles Keeling's son Ralph continues his father's legacy by extending the data.

Ralph Keeling told Axios the first few days of April have shown CO2 levels at or above 420 ppm, and based on month-to-month growth rates, this will be the first month to eclipse this milestone.

""I think it's virtually a done deal,"" he said of the monthly average, noting it will increase further in May.

What they're saying: ""CO2 is still rocketing up. If you look at the record, it's just relentless. So as much as people have been working hard and need to be working hard to slow the growth rate, we have to be honest that we haven't done much yet to actually curb the build-up,"" Keeling said.

Pieter Tans, who tracks greenhouse gases for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the speed of the CO2 increase is striking. Tans said CO2 will be ""over 420 ppm"" during April.

Coming out of the last ice age, he said, CO2 went up by about 80 ppm during 6,000 years. Yet now it's increasing by more than 2 ppm ""every single year.""

The 400 ppm milestone was eclipsed less than a decade ago, in 2013, and 440 ppm isn't far off, he warned. He described the growth rate as ""an explosion"" from a geological perspective.

The intrigue: The CO2 concentration numbers may seem abstract, but they correspond to huge upticks in the amount of heat being added to the oceans and atmosphere. This is melting ice caps and raising sea levels, as well as leading to increasingly destructive extreme weather events.

What's next: The typical annual peak in CO2 amounts at Mauna Loa occurs in May, before vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere soaks up the gas throughout the warm season.",,[],"['Andrew Freedman', 'Authors Afreedman']"
From pollutant to product: the companies making stuff from CO2,"In a warehouse laboratory in Berkeley, California, Nicholas Flanders stands in front of a shiny metal box about the size of a washing machine. Inside is a stack of metal plates that resemble a club sandwich – only the filling is a black polymer membrane coated with proprietary metal catalyst. “We call the membrane the black leaf,” he says.

Flanders is the co-founder and CEO of Twelve, a startup founded in 2015, which received a $57m funding boost in July. It aims to take air – or, to be more precise, the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in it – and transform it into something useful, as plants also do, eliminating damaging emissions in the process. Taking the unwanted gas wreaking havoc on our climate and using only water and renewable electricity, Twelve’s metal box houses a new kind of electrolyser that transforms the CO 2 into synthesis gas (syngas), a mix of carbon monoxide and hydrogen that can be made into a range of familiar products usually made from fossil fuels. Oxygen is the only by-product. This August, the pilot scale equipment made the syngas that went into what Flanders claims is the world’s first carbon neutral, fossil-free jet fuel produced by electrolysing CO 2 . “This is a new way of moving carbon through our economy without pulling it out of the ground,” he says.

Twelve is one of many companies beginning to make stuff out of CO 2 , captured either from industrial emissions or directly from the air. High-end goods such as vodka, diamonds and activewear, industrial materials such as concrete, plastic, foam and carbon fibre, and even food, are all beginning to be created using CO 2 . In addition to jet fuel, which is a partnership with the US air force, Twelve has been using its syngas to explore making parts of car interiors with Mercedes-Benz, laundry detergent ingredients with Tide and sunglasses lenses with Pangaia. Online marketplaces such as Expedition Air and SkyBaron are even springing up to sell consumer goods made with CO 2 emissions.

The beauty of carbon is you can make so many different things Volker Sick, mechanical engineer

“We are at the very early end of a new carbon tech industry,” says Pat Sapinsley, of the Urban Future Lab at New York University, who oversees a new accelerator programme to help fledgling startups get a foothold. While the industry is still only emerging – most activity is only at bench or pilot scale – it is estimated by the Lab there are now about 350 startups hoping to deliver so-called carbon-to-value. Venture capital investment has sharply risen. This year, over $550m had flowed in by the end of September according to research and consulting firm Cleantech Group; that’s more than in the previous five years put together.

The sector could have the potential to reduce the world’s CO 2 emissions by more than 10%, according to analysis by the University of Michigan’s Global CO 2 Initiative, which aims to help the sector emerge (fuels and building materials such as concrete and aggregates are considered to hold the biggest CO 2 mitigation – and market – potential). That contribution, advocates argue, firmly makes carbon utilisation part of the suite of technologies we are going to need to reach the net zero commitments governments and corporations have been making and which, it is becoming clear, can’t be met by renewable electricity alone. “I don’t see a path to net zero without these kinds of technologies,” says Richard Youngman, CEO of Cleantech Group.

Premium running shoe brand On – which went public this September – realised that if it was going to reach its aggressive net zero targets it would need to rethink its materials. Its vision is now that half of all its shoe bottom foam will be made not from petrochemicals but captured carbon. Last month, it announced plans to team up with US-based startup LanzaTech – an early pioneer of the sector, which uses a patented fermentation process to make ethanol out of waste carbon monoxide collected from factories which would otherwise be burnt to emit CO 2 – and chemical manufacturer Borealis, which makes the foam by polymerising ethylene (to which ethanol can be converted). On is hoping to unveil its first pair of shoes made wholly from captured carbon sometime next year (it has separate arrangements to make the shoe uppers). That first pair will cost about $1m to make, says Caspar Coppetti, On’s co-founder and executive co-chairman. It’s a lab endeavour to prove viability – but, eventually, when it scales, he doesn’t expect the shoes to cost much more than a regular pair.

It’s not that CO 2 isn’t already used industrially (think carbonated beverages). But those uses either put the gas unchanged back into the atmosphere or, in the case of enhanced oil recovery, where injected CO 2 pushes out oil and then remains underground, still perpetuates the extraction of new fossil fuels. What’s different here is that waste CO 2 is chemically transformed to make new products. Some, such as building materials, eliminate emissions by locking the carbon away permanently; others, such as jet fuel, prevent new emissions by recycling already emitted carbon. Often grouped with utilisation is CO 2 sequestration, which promises to store large amounts of captured CO 2 permanently underground, but the two are quite different, as advocates point out. “It’s almost a sin to throw away a valuable resource,” says Volker Sick, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan who directs the Global CO 2 Initiative. “The beauty of carbon is you can make so many different things.”

New York-based startup Air Company, launched in 2017, is selling CO 2 -made vodka and perfume, and produced hand sanitiser during the pandemic. Like Twelve, it starts with CO 2 , water and renewable energy but combines them in its reactor to make alcohols such as ethanol. A litre of vodka removes a pound of CO 2 , and it may soon even use CO 2 captured from the heating systems of Manhattan office buildings (in a collaboration with capture startup CarbonQuest).

A watch sold by Expedition Air which is made with Carbon Upcycling’s CO2-enhanced concrete.

But, like Twelve, Air Company has jet fuel in its sights – which can also be produced from ethanol. It is a crowded field – others pressing ahead with CO 2 -made jet fuel include LanzaJet, a spinoff from ethanol maker LanzaTech, and SynHelion, which uses solar energy to transform CO 2 to syngas.

Typically, it is small amounts – think litres per hour – of jet fuel being made at this stage, says Ian Hayton, a materials and chemicals analyst at Cleantech Group. But countries are beginning to introduce quotas for sustainable aviation fuels, which could move things forwards. And the advantage of making it from CO 2 , rather than biomass or waste vegetable oils, is that it uses far less land.

Canadian company CarbonCure, founded in 2012, is one of the pioneers on the building materials side. Backed by investors such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Bill Gates’s investment firm, its technology involves injecting CO 2 into concrete as it is being mixed. The injected CO 2 reacts with the wet concrete and rapidly becomes permanently stored as a mineral, the same one as in limestone. CarbonCure’s business model is to license its technology to concrete manufacturers themselves. CarbonCure retrofits their systems, transforming them into carbon tech companies (the CO 2 is supplied by waste emission sources in their region). It gives them a green sales advantage, but really what the concrete producers like is the economic benefit, says co-founder and CEO Robert Niven. It means less cement is needed to make the concrete – most are able to reduce their cement content by about 5% – and the addition of the CO 2 also strengthens the final material.

It is hard to imagine that food in the form of protein could be mass produced from CO 2 , but that is exactly what another subset of carbon tech companies are working on. Some, such as Solar Foods in Finland, and Air Protein in California – which uses the tagline “meat made from air” – intend their products for human consumption, while others, such as UK- and Netherlands-based Deep Branch, are focusing on animal feed ingredients. With inputs typically of CO 2 , water and renewable electricity along with ammonia and nutrients, their proteins are produced in bioreactors from naturally occurring microbes. The microbes grow and multiply and are then dried out to produce a protein powder with all the essential amino acids. “It is somewhere between dried meat, dried soy and dried carrot,” says Pasi Vainikka, Solar Foods co-founder and CEO, of its product Solein. Admittedly, that doesn’t sound very appetising, but, says Vainikka, the taste comes in the final product and Solein is versatile. It could replace pea and soy protein isolate in processed foods or even be used as a feed for the cultivated meat industry. Treated with heat and pressure, it can be eaten like a tasty slab of steak or tofu. Two kilograms of CO 2 makes a kilogram of the product and it has been submitted to food regulators in Europe and the UK for novel food approval.

Yet the field also faces many challenges to come to fruition. First, if the technology is really going to serve the climate, it has to be scaled up for mass production quickly and offer price-competitive products. “There’s no point unless we can deliver on scale,” says Allison Dring, CEO of German startup Made of Air, which is focusing on plastics replacements. Many of the companies have plans for their first commercial facilities – Twelve, for example, which has designed its equipment to be modular so it can easily be added to increase capacity, a bit like a solar farm, hopes to have its first shipping container-sized plant by next year and predicts significant commercial volume by 2023. But scaling up is capital intensive and takes time.

One specific roadblock is finding customers. The startups need bigger companies to pair up with to buy their CO 2 -made raw materials, but it can be hard for them to break into established supply chains. A big focus of the startup accelerator programme run out of the Urban Futures Lab, called the C2V Initiative, is on making inter-industry connections but, really, more early movers like On are needed. CarbonCure is proud of the fact that 450 concrete plants have been retrofitted with its technology – accounting for virtually all the carbon utilisation project deployments to date, says Niven – but it is only a tiny fraction of the more than 100,000 concrete plants there are worldwide. “Right now, what we need is partners,” he says.

Another bottleneck to scale may be providing the large and low-cost quantities of CO 2 needed. While technologies are certainly established to capture CO 2 from industrial sources, it is only done on a minuscule scale at present, experts note. Direct air capture is less technologically developed and more expensive. And infrastructure will be needed to move the CO 2 if, for example, it is being captured in a different place from where it is being used.

Massive government intervention and support are required for rapid growth, say advocates – be that by setting a carbon price, through procurement policies in government contracts that require CO 2 -based alternatives, or by infrastructure investment. “This needs to be exponential growth… and we need policies to support it,” says Peter Styring, an expert in carbon capture and utilisation at the University of Sheffield, who directs its Centre for Carbon Dioxide Utilisation. And while recent US efforts are welcomed – the US infrastructure bill, for example, includes over $8bn for direct air capture and CO 2 transportation and storage – “there is space for governments to be braver,” says Cleantech’s Youngman.

More detailed guidelines for carbon accounting might also be needed to aid consumer acceptance. Life cycle analyses for the products need to take the whole of the supply chain into account, but companies can set the boundaries in a way that excludes some processes. “We studied concrete production and, in some cases, it actually was worse than just making regular concrete,” says Sick. Both he and Styring are working on improving how companies might perform their assessments as part of an international effort.

And just how controversial carbon utilisation will be remains an open question. Not everyone is gung-ho. Innovation has a role to play in curbing climate change, says Mike Childs, head of policy at the environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth, but such “wonder technologies” are “unproven” to work at the massive scale envisaged and are therefore a “huge gamble” with both people’s lives and the planet. “We know that driving down emissions at source is the best and cheapest way to limit global heating,” he says, adding that the technology also risks providing political and business leaders with justification to keep burning fossil fuels.

The transition away from fossil fuels is a must, say the advocates of CO 2 utilisation. But if we want modern life to go on as normal without sacrifices, we’ll need to find new ways of continuing to produce the goods fossil fuels have given us. This industry, they argue, will not only help mitigate climate change but provide the carbon-based products we will always need. “There’s a lot of ‘climate don’ts’,” says Flanders. “[But] you can actually continue to use products that you like, just made in a better way.”",,[],['Zoë Corbyn']
