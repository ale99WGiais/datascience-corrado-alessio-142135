Scientists unlocking secret of phycocyanin instability for vivid blues,"Phycocyanin is a food colourant that provides a vivid blue pigment. However, it has a drawback: it can prove unstable when used in formulations like soft drinks and sports beverages, losing its hues under fluorescent light on the grocery store shelf.

Scientists at Cornell University say they have found the reason for this unique behaviour ‘with the help of physics’ and the ‘bright X-ray beams’ from the University’s synchrotron.

“Phycocyanin has a vibrant blue colour,”​ said Alireza Abbaspourrad, assistant professor of food chemistry and ingredient technology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “However, if you want to put phycocyanin into acidified beverages, the blue colour fades quickly due to thermal treatment.”​

Now, they believe they have the opportunity to stabilise it, according to new research published in the American Chemical Society’s journal BioMacromolecules​.

The research, ‘Tuning C-Phycocyanin Photoactivity via pH-Mediated Assembly–Disassembly​’, was authored by Ying Li, a doctoral student in food science; Richard Gillilan, staff scientist at the Macromolecular X-ray science at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source; and Abbaspourrad.

Protein structure and colour stability

Most food companies seeking blues in their food use synthetic food dye, Abbaspourrad said.

Phycocyanin is derived from algae and as such it represents a natural and more nutritional protein that could help food and beverage manufacturers meet growing demand for clean label, natural products. The food scientists therefore set out to understand its colour properties and how it worked.

To achieve this, the researchers partnered with the Macromolecular Diffraction Facility of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) and used Size-Exclusion Chromatography coupled to Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SEC−SAXS) on a beamline.

Phycocyanin was placed into a biological fluid and brought to the MacCHESS laboratory. There, intense beamline X-rays were channelled into tiny drops of the fluid. The small-angle X-ray scattering showed that as pH levels, the molecular strands changed into different shapes, folds and assemblies.

“As pH changes, the phycocyanin molecules form in different ways. If the pH goes up, the molecules come together and if the pH level goes down, the molecules disassemble,”​ explained Li.

“As we changed the environmental stimulus for the phycocyanin, the molecules modulate their behaviour in terms of how they interact with light. It's a relationship of the protein structure and the colour stability.”​

The acidity of the environment can essentially mediate an assembly-disassembly pathway, Abbaspourrad said. “Through the X-ray scattering we could see the proteins and see how their monomers are assembled together and how the oligomers disassemble. That’s the root cause for how the blue colour fades,”​ he explained.

Phycocyanin Pigment from Microalgae Biofilms Cultured on Wastewater,"New research published in Frontiers in Energy Research has demonstrated a process for cultivating microalgae biofilms in photobioreactors to produce these commercially important chemicals using wastewater.

Phycocyanin pigments are vital for multiple industries, having various important commercial applications. Producing them from gas and oil wastewater presents a sustainable waste valorization process that fits the aims of the circular economy concept.

Phycocyanin

Phycocyanin, along with allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin, is a pigment-protein complex. It is a water-soluble light-harvesting phycobiliprotein with a characteristic light blue color and is an accessory pigment to chlorophyll. Phycocyanins are produced by cyanobacteria.

There are numerous commercial and scientific uses of phycocyanin. It is used as a natural food coloring, in nutritional supplements (for example, spirulina,) as a coloring in cosmetics, and as fluorescent markers in immunological assays. It is also used in animal feeds and aquaculture. Additionally, it contains anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and antiviral properties, making it an attractive target for therapeutics and drugs within the biomedical industry.

Using Petrochemical Wastewater for Microalgae Culture

The petrochemical industries produce large volumes of wastewater globally as a result of oil and gas extraction. Over 90% is re-injected into formations or disposal wells for recovery. Treatment ponds are used to store most of the remaining wastewater. If disposed of untreated into the environment, wastewater can cause significant levels of pollution, affecting vulnerable ecosystems.

Using produced wastewater for the cultivation of algae is a huge opportunity for the valorization of waste streams in the oil and gas industries. This can be used for nutrient recovery, with the biomass used for beneficial purposes. A 2017 study has found that whilst produced wastewater has high salinity and organic compounds that are detrimental for algae growth, important inorganic nutrients which microbes use for growth are present, which is advantageous. Produced wastewater can therefore be used as a culture medium.

Additionally, there are indications that using produced wastewater for microalgal cultivation can be used for biofuel production as well as microbial wastewater treatment. Another recent study has demonstrated the possibility of utilizing microalgal cultivation for nutrient removal.

The majority of current investigations into using produced wastewater as a microalgae cultivation medium have focused on using microalgal biofilms for biofuel production. Conversely, there is limited research into the production of valuable bioproducts. Integrating side streams of valuable bioproducts into processes using microalgal biorefineries could help reduce the costs associated with microalgal wastewater treatment and biofuel production.

The recovery of phycobiliproteins such as phycocyanin and their derivative products can be easily integrated into microalgae biorefinery operations, and the water solubility of phycobiliproteins means that they do not interfere with the recovery of denser liquids. Thus, integrating them into these operations can optimize operations and add value to them.

Suitable substrates for microalgae biofilm growth have been identified in the current literature, with over 15 different materials so far explored. Cotton-based materials have been identified as the best-performing options.

The Study

The main purpose of the new study published online in Frontiers in Energy Research is to evaluate the influence of growth materials and light intensity in a rotating algae biofilm reactor on phycocyanin production. LLC2, a strain of cyanobacteria, was chosen for its ability to form biofilms in different light and substrate conditions. High levels of turbidity and good solid biomass production were identified as key factors in the choice of the reactor for the study.

The team constructed a 2000-liter outdoor-produced water pond at Utah State University. The pool was operated between August and September due to favorable outdoor temperature and the pond was shaded to control light intensity. Out of the materials tested for biofilm growth substratum, the cotton rope was identified as the best option.

Amongst the experimental observations in the study, low light LLC2 biofilms produced twice the amount of phycocyanin per biomass yield compared to high light biofilms. An accompanying crude extract purity (just above the benchmark standard for food-grade phycocyanin) was observed. The authors concluded that different production goals could be achieved by adjusting the light level for biofilm culture.

Based on their experimental observations, the authors have stated that future studies should concentrate on producing other high-value products from microalgae cultures in produced wastewater. Additionally, amongst other future research directions suggested in the study, the potential value of cyanobacteria biofilms to produce valuable bioproducts such as fertilizer, feed, biofuels, and biogas should be assessed in studies.

"Buoys placed in Lake Erie, act as floating laboratories","CLEVELAND — Four high-tech buoys acting as floating laboratories are placed in central Lake Erie each May to collect data, monitor water quality and much more.

What You Need To Know Four smart buoys monitor water quality in central Lake Erie as part of the Smart Lake Erie Watershed Initiative



It’s a collaborative project from Cleveland Water Alliance, Cleveland Water, and Limnotech



The buoys help give the water department advance notice of potential water quality issues and much more



Other industries such as fishing and boating use the public data from the buoys ​

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 11 million people depend on Lake Erie for drinking water, including about 3 million people in Ohio and about 1.4 million in Cleveland.

Scott Moegling, the water quality manager for Cleveland Water, looks forward to the day each year when the four smart buoys are placed in central Lake Erie to collect data on water conditions.

“They're expensive, but they're worth it. We've learned a lot of good information, and a better understanding of Lake Erie and and water quality in the water that we treat,"" Moegling said. ""If you'd have told me 30 years ago that I'd be looking at satellite imagery and using remote laboratories out in the lake to help me treat water, I probably would have laughed and said no way, but here we are.”

The buoys are deployed by environmental scientists from Limnotech, the water science and engineering firm which engineers the buoys. The first buoy deployed in 2010, then the next came in 2016 and two more last year.

“This one is going to go out three-and-a-half miles. We've got one that's 12 miles out they're putting out right now,"" he said. ""We'll have another one over at Nottingham, it'll be about three-and-a-half miles and then one over at our Crown Water Plant over off of Westlake, that one will be about three miles offshore.”

The buoys’ gathered information is sent to an online monitoring system 24 hours a day where it is viewed by Cleveland Water staff and the public. The buoys help give the water department hours of advanced notice of a water quality issue long before the water is drawn into a treatment plant.

“By getting that extra lead time, we can not only gear up manpower, we can gear up chemicals, we can anticipate needed changes,” Moegling said. “We can increase testing and be more vigilant when we know that something may be coming at us.”

The sensors on the buoys track a variety of things including temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, phycocyanin, which is a blue-green algae pigment, chlorophyll, which is an algae pigment, and other things that the water department can use to identify water quality parameters they need for treatment.

The data isn’t just useful to the water department. Many other industries like fishing and boating benefit. Moegling said the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and the Coast Guard use the buoys' data.

“The fishing industry, they'll use our dissolved oxygen data and to identify where to go fish, you know, if there's a low oxygen then the fish won't be there,” Moegling said. “Boaters use it, the wave height, wave period, the wind speed and directions are important for boaters.”

In 2021, Cleveland Water Alliance (CWA), Cleveland Water, and LimnoTech activated the Smart Lake Erie Watershed, an award-winning regional smart water monitoring network. It's the first of it's kind in the nation and is used to inform and improve public health, safety, utility operations, supply chain management, and water security throughout Greater Cleveland. Because of this advanced technology, Lake Erie is one of the most studied and digitally-connected bodies of freshwater on earth. Moegling said other organizations have their own smart buoys deployed on the lake as well for other reasons.

“It’s great that we have this beautiful resource right here for us to use and to enjoy and to recreate on,” Moegling said. “We’re getting a better understanding about the lake itself. Once we understand that, and understand all the complexities of the lake, then we can manage it better.”

The organization asks that people stay at least 100 feet away from the buoys, especially fishermen who are trawling behind their boats.

“Cleveland water has great treatment,” Moegling said. “We put out high quality water that meets all the regulations and then beyond. And we're really proud of the quality of water that we're able to put out.”

Taiyo wows at Vitafoods with special product prototypes,"Taiyo, the expert in health-promoting natural ingredients, introduced innovative concepts that generated great interest among visitors to Vitafoods Europe in Geneva.

The focus was on Taiyo's water-soluble ingredients such as Sunfiber, SunActive Mg and combination products like SunCurcumin. Additionally, Taiyo presented a blue Sunfiber, which consists of a combination with phycocyanin from the spirulina algae.

Other popular new products included power shot concepts based on prebiotic juice powders with Sunfiber, which were eagerly tasted by attendees, as well as prototypes of matcha pralines and Taiyo’s elderberry-based ElderMune gummies.

Taiyo presented more than 40 new product concepts at Vitafoods, based on seven different raw materials, including Guar bean fiber (PHGG), matcha, and elderberry. Highlights at the booth were its water-soluble ingredients – a range of Sunfiber blends with various additional health benefits, like blue Sunfiber: It consists of a combination from Sunfiber and the spirulina algae, which contains a lot of protein and is said to slow down ageing processes, and also strengthen the immune system .[1]​ Moringa Extract S, a standardised leaf powder with 10% glucomoringin, which has anti-inflammatory properties, also generated great interest. Whether presented as a capsule or tablet, visitors were excited by the variety of options available.

Another special offer at the Taiyo stand was vegan bolognese, made with Vegemeat, a granulated pea protein that is free from soy, gluten, additives and preservatives, and has a convincing, minced meat-like texture. It is particularly suitable for making dishes such as meat-free bolognese or lasagna and therfore appeals to the consumer group who follow a vegan or low-meat diet, or suffer from intolerances and therefore closely study ingredient lists. Thanks to the gentle manufacturing process, Vegemeat convinces with a low acrylamide value and is thus superior to many other legume-based meat alternatives.

Dr Stefan Siebrecht, Managing Director of Taiyo's German subsidiary, says: ""The trend towards organic products was really noticeable at the show. As consumers are increasingly questioning a product's ingredients and wanting natural and plant-based alternatives, manufacturers of end products are on the search for suitable solutions.""​

Another trend evident at Vitafoods was growing interest in functional confectionery. Delicious gummies with added health benefits, for example, are becoming increasingly popular among consumers. They can be easily adapted to the different needs of various consumer groups and are available as a healthy alternative to conventional fruit gums.

Taiyo has quickly responded to this trend and showcased its ElderMune gummies, which contain elderbery juice powder plus Sunfiber. These small berries positively impact immune health because they are rich in vitamins C and B, and contain essential oils and minerals. So-called anthocyanins – secondary plant substances – are not only responsible for the berry´s rich black-blue color but also protect the body's cells from free radicals. Heart and blood pressure also benefit from advantageous elderberries as they have anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects. They therefore provide a great alternative to cranberries in combating cystitis and kidney disease, and help thoroughly flush the excretory organs.[2]​

Start-up ‘beats the blues’ with spirulina-based food colouring for hot and cold beverages,"The colour blue is rare in nature, and as such, the pigment has been highly sought after – in textiles and paints alike – for millennia.

An ‘eye-catching’ and ‘exciting’ colour, blue has also proved an attractive hue for food and beverage makers. In the drinks category, well-known blue drinks range from blue lagoon cocktails to berry-flavoured soft drinks, blue lattes and functional sports beverages.

As the clean label trend continues apace, consumers are increasingly looking to avoid artificial synthetic colorants. But in the blue category, whether synthetic or natural, Israeli start-up Gavan says both face the same problem.

“Both synthetic blue dyes and plant-based blue colouring have regulatory, stability, intensity, or price challenges,” ​explained Yael Leader, head of product for Gavan.

“The main barrier to creating food formulations with natural colours is stability – the ability to overcome formulation challenges and ensure vibrant and consistent true blue throughout the product’s shelf life.” ​

While delivering a health-stable, naturally derived, vibrant blue for products with low pH is ‘tricky’, as any heat treatment or shift in pH can influence the colour’s shade, Gavan believes it has found the solution in spirulina.

Phycocyanin pigment-protein​

A type of blue-green algae, spirulina contains a pigment-protein known as phycocyanin, which produces a pure blue colour.

Gavan’s proprietary, non-GMO technology extracts phycocyanin and optomises the colourant ‘gently, without damaging the source, and enables the extraction of multiple compounds from the whole spirulina, without waste.

The result is a stable, blue colourant developed from technology that protects it from fading, event at pH as low as 3.0 or when pasteurised at 90°C for 30 seconds, noted the start-up.

“In addition, the platform’s control over particle size offers improved stability throughout the final product’s shelf life.” ​

Fortified drink potential​

Gavan says its platform allows for a ‘full spectrum’ of stable shades of blue, but as blue is a primary colour, it also ‘opens a window’ to producing other colours, from non-chlorophyll green to purple shades.

The start-up’s natural colouring formulation can be used for hot beverages, such as tea and coffee, as well as functional drinks and sports drinks.

“We have experienced quite a hearty demand from companies who are saying their consumers are looking for new experiences They have expressed a desire to widen their colour palates and are becoming more adventurous,” ​Itai Cohen, CEO and co-founder of Gavan, told FoodNavigator.

“This has spurred a growing demand for natural colours, whether blue or green, primarily for categories like functional beverages such as sports drinks and energy drinks and even cocktails.” ​

However, within the functional beverage category, when a large amount of vitamins and minerals can be added, ingredients can react with pigments and accelerate the colour degradation process.

This can cause fading, or create a complex binding of pigments and minerals that can deposit sedimentation in the final application, we were told.

Gavan’s platform provides a solution for the fortified beverages sector, amongst others.

From a clean label perspective, the colourant is marked as ‘spirulina extract’ on ingredients lists. “It complies with FDA-21 CFR US code of federal regulation code title 21,” ​said Cohen.

“The colouring principle complies with section 75.530 spirulina extract.” ​",,[],['Flora Southey']

The best vegan sources of protein to include in your diet,"If you’ve just decided to go vegan, you’re probably wondering where to find the best vegan sources of protein. No wonder – for most people, switching to a plant-based lifestyle means completely overhauling their dietary habits. Without meat, dairy and eggs, many people may struggle to structure their diet in a way that helps them to meet their protein requirements.

So do you need to eat meat to get protein? In short, no – but it does require more planning and preparation. This is because protein is present in many different plants, but the quality may not always be comparable to that found in animal-based foods. Meat, dairy and eggs contain enough of all the essential amino acids – the building blocks of protein molecules that we are unable to produce ourselves. Most vegan sources of protein tend to lack one or more of these important components.

Of course, investing in the best vegan protein powder is one way to ensure you’re getting a full amino acid profile. Another option is to include more complete, or almost complete, plant-based protein sources in your diet. Here are eight of the best vegan sources of protein to help you meet your requirements while enjoying a plant-based lifestyle.

Also, check our 7-day plant-based diet meal plan for more ideas how to cook without animal-based foods!

1. Tofu and tempeh

Soy and soy-based products, such as tofu and tempeh, are one of the most common staples in plant-based kitchens around the world. Not only do they work well with a variety of dishes, they’re easy to prepare and a rich source of complete protein. What’s more, soybean products contain many important nutrients.

According to a review published in Nutrients (opens in new tab), tofu and tempeh are excellent sources of calcium , manganese and selenium , as well as highly bioactive compounds called isoflavones. Isoflavones are polyphenols that may mimic the effects of female reproductive hormones. Despite concerns that these compounds may negatively affect men’s health, available evidence (opens in new tab) suggests this is not the case. In fact, quite the opposite – multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that a high intake of soy and soy products may lead to a vastly reduced risk of dying from breast, gastric, colorectal, prostate and lung cancers, as well as cardiovascular diseases. Many of these effects have been attributed to isoflavones.

According to a review published in Molecules (opens in new tab), these polyphenols also have the potential to reduce blood pressure, regulate blood sugar levels, lower cholesterol levels and combat inflammation.

Add tofu and tempeh to salads, stir fries and one pot dishes. Also, use instead of meat alternatives, beans, peas and lentils.

Protein:

3 oz (85g) serving of tofu contains 8g of protein

3 oz serving (85g) of tempeh contains 11g of protein

2. Seitan

Seitan is a plant-based meat substitute made out of wheat gluten and as such, it’s often referred to as ‘wheat meat’ or ‘wheat gluten’.

Unlike similar soy-based products, it closely resembles the look and texture of cooked animal flesh. Apart from its distinctive chicken-like flavor, seitan is famous for its exceptionally high protein content.

However, despite being one of the richest vegan sources of protein available on the market, it’s worth mentioning that seitan is relatively low in the essential amino acid lysine, unless the wheat used for its production was fortified with this ingredient.

When it comes to nutritional value, seitan is low in fats and carbohydrates, and fairly high in selenium, iron , calcium, and phosphorus . It’s a great addition to any plant-based diet, but owing to its high gluten content, seitan can't be eaten by individuals suffering from celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.

Seitan is a great alternative to cooked meat. It can be pan-fried, sautéed or grilled, and added to soups, salads and stews.

Protein:

3 oz (85g) of seitan contains 64g of protein

3. Quinoa

Quinoa (pronounced keen-waa) is a highly versatile and easy to prepare pseudo grain from South America, and has a mild, nutty flavor that easily complements many dishes. This grain is particularly valued by people suffering from celiac disease as it doesn’t contain gluten.

Whilst a cup of cooked quinoa provides less than 10g of protein (slightly lower than other plant-based proteins) it is a popular food staple among vegans and vegetarians because it boasts a complete amino acid profile. It also has a particularly high lysine content.

But that’s not the only health benefit associated with this plant. According to a review published in the Molecules (opens in new tab) journal, quinoa is a rich source of biologically active compounds that have strong antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. What’s more, multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that regular consumption of quinoa provides protection against multiple different cardiovascular, metabolic, and degenerative diseases. It may also have a beneficial effect on the functioning of the immune system and menopause symptoms.

Quinoa works well for quick, one pan recipes or as an alternative to rice, pasta or porridge.

Protein:

One cup of cooked quinoa contains approximately 8g of protein

4. Buckwheat

Buckwheat is another gluten-free pseudo-cereal that provides good quality protein. Similar to quinoa, it contains a significant amount of the essential amino acid lysine. It’s also a great source of phosphorus, manganese, copper, magnesium and iron, as well as containing a wide array of biologically active compounds like flavonoids and beta-glucans.

What’s more, multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that regular consumption of buckwheat grain can help to regulate cholesterol levels, combat systemic inflammation and lower blood pressure, as well as reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease and several different types of cancer.

The most common way to eat buckwheat is in the form of soba noodles. These grains can also be cooked similarly to oatmeal, or ground into a flour and used in baking, particularly for pancakes and other breakfast dishes.

Protein:

One cup (168g) of cooked buckwheat oats provides approximately 6g of protein

5. Chia seeds

Chia seeds first rose to prominence as a unique cooking aid. The dietary fibers in chia seeds are able to rapidly soak up water and create a jelly-like texture, making them a great ingredient in baked goods, puddings and desserts.

First and foremost, however, they’re an excellent vegan source of protein, providing a significant amount of all essential amino acids. Chia seeds also contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary fibers, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus and potassium.

Owing to their great nutritional value, chia seeds may be highly beneficial for our health. According to a review published in Molecules (opens in new tab), regular consumption of chia seeds can reduce the risk of developing neurodegenerative and liver diseases, as well as hypertension, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular problems. Multiple studies have also shown that they can help with losing weight, reducing waist circumference and improving endurance in long-distance runners.

Chia seeds can be used to make puddings, desserts and pectin-free jams. They’re also commonly used as an egg substitute in vegan baking, and work well as a topping for oatmeal, salads or smoothies.

Protein:

Two tablespoons (28g) of chia seeds provide 4g of protein

6. Hemp seeds

Hemp seeds are the small, edible fruits of the Cannabis sativa plant. If that raises your eyebrows, don’t worry – hemp seeds only contain traces of THC , the psychoactive ingredient that this recreational drug is known for. According to a review published in Nutrients (opens in new tab), the amount of THC in hemp-based foods is below the threshold of 0.3%, making it suitable for consumption.

There are definitely benefits to including more hemp seeds in your diet. These little pips not only have a pleasant, nutty taste and work well with a range of different dishes, they’re also very nutritious. Hemp seeds provide a whooping 32g of protein per 100g. They’re also rich in antioxidants and polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid (omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid ( omega-3 ), as well as iron, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and zinc. According to a review published in the Cancers (opens in new tab) journal, due to their strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, cannabinoids in hemp seeds can suppress and prevent tumor cells from developing and spreading further in the body.

Hemp seeds can be sprinkled over yogurts or salads, added to smoothies, or included in homemade granola and energy bars.

Protein:

Three tablespoons (30g) of raw, hulled hemp seeds contain 10g of protein

7. Spirulina algae

The last few years have seen a steep rise in studies exploring the nutritional value and health benefits associated with marine algae. According to a review published in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture (opens in new tab), spirulina is one of the richest complete protein sources of microbial origin, almost on par with meat and soybeans. It also delivers a significant amount of B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, copper and iron, as well as multiple bioactive compounds, including phenolics, phycocyanins, and polysaccharides.

Multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that spirulina algae exhibits strong antioxidant, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, and may play an active role in preventing heart disease, hypertension, degenerative conditions, exercise-induced muscle damage and infectious diseases.

There’s even some emerging evidence (opens in new tab) that these algae can reduce mental fatigue, protect the brain vessels from damage and contribute to cognitive function.

Spirulina is mostly sold in the form of a powder with a characteristic green hue. This can be added to smoothies, granola bars, soups and salads. It can also be purchased as tablets.

Protein:

1 tablespoon (7 g) of dried spirulina provides 4g of protein

8. Beans, peas and lentils

Pulses (beans, peas and lentils) are not considered complete protein sources as they tend to contain fairly small amounts of two important essential amino acids – methionine and cysteine. However, since pulses are otherwise rich protein sources and deliver the bulk of this macronutrient in most plant-based diets, they deserve a mention.

According to a review published in the Journal of Medicinal Food (opens in new tab), pulses provide a hefty dose of dietary fiber , iron, zinc, folate, calcium and magnesium, as well as a wide range of phytochemicals with strong antioxidant and antimutagenic properties. Due to their low glycemic index, they may also help you to lose weight and keep your blood sugar under control.

Beans and lentils play an important role in regulating blood pressure, blood lipid profile and blood glucose metabolism, as well as reducing systemic inflammation and protecting against cardiovascular diseases. Although, some sensitive individuals may find pulses hard to digest.

Cooked pulses work great with most salads, soups and plant-based main meals, particularly stews and curries.

Protein:

A cup (200g) of boiled pulses provides anywhere from 15g (kidney beans, lentils and black beans) up to 39g (edamame beans and chickpeas) of protein",,[],['Anna Gora']
French Brewer Uses Algae to Make Blue Beer,"A French beer-making business, or brewery, is using a special kind of bacteria to turn their beer blue.

The beer, sold under the name Line, is an alcoholic drink made by the Hoppy Urban Brew brewery. The brewery was looking for a way to make its drinks different from other kinds of beer. So, the beer maker partnered with Etika Spirulina. It is a business in northern France that wants to popularize its spirulina algae as a dietary aid.

Sebastien Verbeke works at Hoppy Urban Brew. He told Reuters that the beer is selling well. ""It's getting an enormous amount of interest and curiosity on the part of the public,"" he said.

The part of the spirulina that gives the beer its blue color is called phycocyanin. It is added to the beer during the beer-making process.

Brewery worker Mathilde Vanmansart described the taste of the beer as hoppy, light, and a little fruity. She added that the only evidence of the added algae was the blue color.

Xavier Delannoy owns the farm that provides the spirulina. He said after several tests, the brewery had found a mixture that pleased buyers.

He said 1,500 bottles of the blue beer were sold between October and December last year. The brewery is now preparing to increase its production to meet demand.

Who fancies some blue food? Really?

The theory of food colour confusion may originate from us being strongly aroused by foods on the red spectrum. Research published in Nature recently showed that we are more attracted to red coloured foods as they appear to signal better nutrition with higher calories in comparison to blue or green foods. Trichromatic vision evolved in humans as a response to improve foraging and may explain why we rely more on sight than scent when locating the most nutritious foods and fruits that are ripe and ready to eat. This is surprising to us as ‘leafy green’ farmers when we readily assume a green colour relates to health but the Nature study was more assigned to calorific colour arousal. Although our brains may not easily accept the blue colour as natural, our bodies will probably thank us if we do as blue-green algae also known as cyanobacteria has some of the best health benefits. Superfoods: Yogurt with blue Spirulina, Scottish Damsens, Blueberries and Sloes.

One particular cyanobacteria has been studied extensively over the years

Spirulina grows naturally in alkaline waters and was recognised and farmed by ancient civilisations for its medicinal qualities. The Aztecs of Mexico have a long historical relationship with Spirulina. They farmed Spirulina in large lakes, then harvested and air dried the algae to form a hard edible ‘cake’. This was often mixed with other foods and used as an energy source as these ancient people recognised it as an important functional food.

Massive health benefits that many people have still to discover

People who move beyond the colour tend to use blue-green algae for supercharging the immune system, controlling muscle spasms, detoxing heavy metals, eliminating candida, improving memory and increasing energy levels to improve exercise performance. It may also lower cholesterol and blood sugar, acting to prevent heart disease, heal wounds and improve digestion. Pretty impressive qualities for this single celled life form billions of years old.

There are two main species of the blue green algae Spirulina, Arthrospira platensis and Arthrospira maxima. As the image demonstrates, they are made up of single cells containing chlorophyll filled vesicles that react to light and photosynthesize like plants. Cultivation of commercial algae usually starts the life cycle in lab culture tubes, doubling quickly under controlled conditions. This helps to eliminate contaminants. Spirulina is the largest single celled blue green algae and it forms spirals visible to the human eye which bunch together to allow a quick harvest and is now cultivated worldwide as a nutritional supplement.

Spirulina is high in iron, calcium, magnesium, copper, beta-carotene and B-vitamins.

Apart from the high content of protein, Spirulina contains B vitamins, particularly B12 and provitamin A (β-carotenes), and minerals, especially iron. It is also rich in phenolic acids, tocopherols and γ-linolenic acid. Spirulina does not have a cellulose cell wall so it is more easily digested. Most people selling dried Spirulina suggest 1-8g per day to boost the immune system but be careful as too much can have negative effects so it’s best to start with the lowest dose.

Some suggest Spirulina has the power to tackle world wide problems like malnutrition. The UN and WHO recommend Spirulina for it’s extremely high nutritional value and sustainability. It has even been called the ‘world’s most sustainable food’ with the potential to end world hunger. The Pole Pole Foundation in the Congo were finalists in the Earthshot Prize recently. They are leading the way to teach communities in developing countries how to grow Spirulina as a supplement to prevent childhood malnutrition.

Could Spirulina be an alternative vegan protein source?

Would you drink blue milk? Many vegans are looking for alternative sources of protein. Spirulina might even be a protein source of the future and a substitute for cow’s milk. Spirulina platensis stands out for being one of the richest protein sources of microbial origin having similar protein levels when compared to meat and soybeans. Not to be confused with regular green Spirulina in its basic form, blue Spirulina is an extract of the active ingredient phycocyanin in its purest form. This concentrates the dried extract with higher levels of antioxidants without so much of the fishy taste of fresh Spirulina. But if you don’t mind using fresh Spirulina (it’s fishy so it’s much better to mix with stronger flavours) it will provide protein that is quickly and easily absorbed in the body compared to animal proteins which is a bonus as it contains many essential amino acids that the body cannot synthesize alone and are essential for tissue renewal.

Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory

Fresh Spirulina is high in antioxidants, especially phycocyanin, the pigment which causes the blue green colour. Phycocyanin can promote blood cell regeneration, improve lymphocyte activity and improve the lymphatic system. Studies have shown this antioxidant scavenges and fights the free radicals that cause oxidative damage.

Spirulina is known to be alkalizing to the body which boosts beneficial microflora in the gut. Liver function is improved and this greatly increases detoxification levels in the body. Fresh Spirulina contains chlorophyll and phycocyanin both of which help to remove toxins such as heavy metals and other pollutants from the blood. One remarkable study in children who lived close to Chernobyl after the nuclear disaster in 1986 found that giving them a small 5g dose of Spirulina a day could reduce radionuclide rates by half in less than two months.

Spirulina has Cancer fighting benefits

Spirulina has been hailed as an anticancer superfood, but reading further into peer reviewed literature is important as there are some extrapolated and conflicting reports from doing a simple google search. So here we only present peer reviewed data. From our research low dose Spirulina has anti-proliferation effects on stomach cancer cells, human leukaemia cells and B lymphoma cells, inhibiting carcinogenesis.

Eating Spirulina daily may lead to increased energy levels

Fresh Spirulina is particularly good for energy owing to its high nutrient density. Since the algae has no cell wall to break down, digestion of all those nutrients is fast and efficient. It can make a difference to energy levels quickly after consumption. Fresh Spirulina contains constituents such as polysaccharides (Rhamnose and Glycogen) and essential fats that are absorbed easily by cells and theoretically aid energy release. More studies are needed to be truly conclusive though but with low toxicity levels in the body, it’s well worth your own trials.

Spirulina enhances energy performance because it unlocks sugar from our cells. If you are suffering from memory loss, this bacteria added daily to your routine appears to have significant effects. It does this by protecting the brain from free-radical damage by increasing the activity of two enzymes: catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which fight free radicals and make the brain more resistant to aging.

But It’s not all good news

Spirulina may exacerbate autoimmune reactions in some people who are susceptible. As such it may worsen symptoms of multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions linked to overactive immune systems. It’s also not recommended for pregnant women or children or people on blood thinners like warfarin. Be cautious where you purchase Spirulina, as it may be contaminated if not bought from a quality source, leading to additional side effects.

Bioavailability: Should it be dried or is live culture better?

Image credit: Ecoduna, Austria If you search for Spirulina online you are mainly going to encounter powdered products. There is nothing wrong with these as most research was conducted on using powdered forms which still showed positive results. However some reports suggest fresh Spirulina has up to 95% bioavailability. This means that 95% of the nutrients including essential amino acids, all the B vitamins and antioxidants are absorbed straight into your bloodstream increasing potency by 45% compared with powder.

How difficult is it to cultivate and commercialize?

Spirulina cultivation requires sufficient aeration, agitation and proper light intensity for enhanced biomass yield, cell productivity, specific growth rate and protein content. Biomass yield has the potential to reach up to 12g/l biomass in a closed reactor system. Urea seems to be a promising alternative source of low-cost nitrogen for Spirulina cultures and addition of mechanised aeration will significantly increase yields. Spirulina vats in a hothouse, Mexico

But what about algal blooms? Are they the same Cyanobacteria?

Spirulina itself is non toxic but other forms of blue green algae including Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, grown and harvested in the wild, is often contaminated and leads to toxic conditions when out of control.

Blue-green algae occurs naturally in lochs, ponds, reservoirs, rivers and the sea. This summer in Scotland it became a real issue. When the conditions are right, blue green algae will create massive blooms so large they can be captured by satellite imaging from space. Blooms are accelerated by leaching of fertilisers, with nitrogen and phosphorus runoff into the water course which becomes detrimental to other life forms by blocking oxygen and releasing toxic microcystins.

So it’s a logical step to grow these in a controlled environment and if market conditions continue to accelerate consumer demand for functional foods then growing these super algae in CEA could be highly profitable for farmers.

Image credit: Earthrise The largest US producer of Spirulina is based in California and they produce on an open 108 acre site, exporting to over 20 countries worldwide. There are disadvantages of open ponds as they do not reach high biomass productivity due to the difficulty of maintaining the optimum temperature and so they are restricted to tropical and subtropical regions. This is mitigated to some extent with large paddles constantly moving the ponds.

Despite this hefty competition, CEA could be the perfect vehicle for growing a crop that has incredible health properties, sequesters CO2 and can be grown in tubing to eliminate contamination. With LED lights and agitation, enhanced yields could be harvested year round.

This could be particularly useful between the shoulder winter months to increase profits and farm skills where wholesale prices have the potential to return profits of up to $15/Kg . A rough estimate of 12g/L biomass can be achieved with a photobioreactor system incorporating PPFD 166 μmol photons m−2 s−1 with potential doubling every 2-6 days depending on the algal species chosen. Based on this, and assuming you harvest 50% at each doubling time, a microfarm running 100L tanks could harvest 0.6Kg every 2 days, giving a total annual yield of 106.2Kg and a potential maximum annual return of $1593. Scaling up production will make more economic sense. Optimizing and automating additional technology (LED lighting, CO2 enhancement and state of the art infrastructure as seen with Algaennovation) may boost production but this must be carefully managed to balance a return on investment.

Learning and applying new ideas – food, fuel & carbon trap

Image courtesy of Energy Futures living laboratory project, Lille France We like to get people talking about the future diversity of CEA. This helps drive innovation and creates wider jobs and skills. At the same time we aim to help you better understand the science and health prospects of plants that could be grown in CEA. Of all the ideas out there, maybe our favourite is the idea of an algae curtain. Glow in the dark tubes of algae obscure prying eyes from your space while producing your own superfood or fuel. Could plants literally fuel plants in a completely carbon neutral circular economy? Biodiesel produced using algae contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and highly biodegradable. This could have potential in offsetting CEA energy outputs and algae fuel cells could make home farms more economically sustainable in the future. There are so many applications for algae, some are even using it to extract CO2 from brewing. Whatever reason you have for growing Spirulina and others (chlorella) there is no doubt about this being classed as a superfood.

Closer to home we like the way CEA farmers are looking to diversify their product range and kudos to On the Grow farms in Rockwall, Texas, growing spirulina alongside their microgreens. They grow in demijohn bottles adjusting the salinity to 2 and pH 10.5-11, harvesting and topping up fresh water every day. In order to maintain high pH and avoid fluctuations, high amounts of sodium bicarbonate must always be included in the culture medium to buffer the solution. The water needs aeration and temperature needs to be tightly regulated to 80F. LED lights will speed up production and your farm will literally bloom. Image credit: On The Grow Farms, Texas

Spirulina first rose to fame as a potential space food. Maybe in space our brains are altered by gravity to be more accepting of blue food. Or maybe we will discover a whole new superfood bacterial species on Mars or deep in the ocean. So who’s got a spare shelf in their vertical farm for this blue superfood and space age protein milk shake?

Influence of Pholiota adiposa on gut microbiota and promote tumor cell apoptosis properties in H22 tumor-bearing mice,"The results of LC–MS analysis

As shown in Fig. 1, in the present study, under optimal chromatographic and MS conditions14,15, 3 compounds were identified by comparing the retention times and matching the empirical molecular formulas with those of known saponins; six phenolic compounds, seven fatty acid compounds, three nucleotide compounds, five quinone compounds, six carbohydrate compounds, and four steroid compounds were identified, and sterol compounds, such as ergosterol peroxide, ergosta-4, 6, 8(14)22-tetraen-3-one, ergosterol, and (22E,24R)-ergosta-7, 22-dien-3β,5α,6β-triol, accounted for a high proportion (Table 1).

Analyses of tumor weight, tumor inhibitory rate, and organ index

The tumor volume growth curves are shown in Fig. 2. The tumor growth rate in the model group was more than 2.6 cm3 on Day 15. In contrast, CTX-treated and all EPA-treated groups showed obvious inhibition of tumor growth.

Figure 2 The effects of EPA on tumor H22 tumor-bearing mice. Full size image

The organ index, tumor weight, and tumor inhibitory rate (TIR) are shown in Table 2. The CTX-treated group exhibited the highest TIR (92.42%). Moreover, the tumor weight in the EPA-treated groups significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, with tumor inhibitory rates of 79.70%, 84.55%, and 87.28%. The spleen and thymus indices were significantly lower in the CTX-treated group than in the normal group, and the thymus was severely atrophic (p < 0.05). The EPA-treated groups showed significant improvements, and there was a protective effect on the spleen and thymus.

Analysis of the expression of serum cytokines and VEGF in mice

ELISA was used to investigate the effects of EPA on serum cytokine production, including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, AST, BUN, and IL-6, in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Angiogenesis has become an important therapeutic target for many tumors and is an essential process for tumor growth and metastasis10,16.

As shown in Fig. 3, compared with the levels in the normal and model groups, the serum levels of IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α significantly increased in the EPA-treated HD group (p < 0.05). VEGF levels were significantly decreased in the CTX-treated and EPA-treated groups. The AST and BUN levels in the model group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group (p < 0.05). The values of these two parameters significantly decreased in the EPA-treated groups compared to those in the model control group (p < 0.05). The AST levels of mice in the CTX-treated group were significantly higher than those of the model group (p < 0.05).

Morphological analysis after treatment with EPA

Histopathology was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the tumor. As shown in Fig. 4A, tumor cell in the model group s were plump and intact, with large nuclei. After treatment with EPA and CTX, the tumor cells exhibited a large necrotic region and were stained darker, which indicates that the significant antitumor efficacy of EPA in H22 tumor-bearing mice involved inducing cell death.

Figure 4 Histological examination of the morphological changes in tumors from H22-bearing mice. Tumor tissues stained with H&E (A) (400 ×) TUNEL assay (400 ×) (B,C). Full size image

The TUNEL assay results are shown in Fig. 4B,C, and cells with brown granules were considered positively stained10,17. The percentage of positive cells in the model group was 5%; therefore, the amount of tumor cell apoptosis was minimal. However, the CTX-treated group exhibited the highest percentage of positive cells (44%). The EPA-treated groups showed an increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, with values of 12%, 28%, and 42%. Moreover, the mice in the HD and EPA-treated group showed a positive cell percentage similar to that of the CTX-treated group.

Effects of EPA on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and VEGF

Based on the results of previous studies18, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the proapoptotic factor BAX, the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase 3 to determine the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, as shown in Fig. 5. BAX and cleaved caspase 3 expression intensities increased, while Bcl-2 expression decreased in the EPA-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the ratio of Bcl-2 to BAX decreased significantly. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level in the EPA-treated groups significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and VEGF expression was lowest in the CTX-treated group.

Figure 5 Immunohistochemical anylisis of tumor tissues and stained area of tumor tissues. Full size image

In addition, western blotting was used to analyze the expression of Bcl-2, BAX, cleaved caspase 3, and VEGF. As shown in Fig. 6, all EPA-treated groups showed increased BAX and cleaved caspase 3 protein expression and decreased Bcl-2 and VEGF protein expression; these results were consistent with the results of the immunohistochemical analysis. However, the expression of PI3K/AKT and p-AKT/AKT increased in a dose-dependent manner in the EPA-treated group.

Results of the rank-abundance curves of microorganisms in samples

The rank-abundance curve is a method used to analyze the diversity of microorganisms. In this study, the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) rank-abundance curves showed the diversity in the samples, which can be explained by species richness and evenness19. In the horizontal direction, the wider the span of the curve is, the richer the species rank of the microorganism sample20. The OTU rank-abundance curve in this study showed that the abundance distribution of the samples was even, as it was flat and smooth in the vertical direction (Fig. 7). The richness and evenness of the samples shown in the rank-abundance curve indicate that the diversity of the samples was rational and reasonable.

Figure 7 OTU Rank-Abundance curves. Different samples are represented by curves of different colors. The abscissa is the number rank sorted by OTU abundance, and the ordinate is the corresponding OTU abundance. Full size image

Dilution curves of microorganisms in the gut microbiota

The dilution curve was used to evaluate whether the sample sequencing depth was sufficient to cover all species of microbes and compare species richness among different sequenced samples. A flat curve indicates that the sequencing data are reasonable and reflect the structure of the entire community21. The number of sequences reached 5000, and the curves were in the plateau stage (Fig. 8). Therefore, the experimental data were deemed reasonable and reliable.

Species accumulation curves of the gut microbiota

The species accumulation curve is used to describe the increase in species with the increase in the number of samples and is an effective tool for investigating the composition and predicting the abundance of species in samples. This curve reflects whether the number of samples was sufficient. In this study, we mainly observed the end of the curve; if it showed a sharp upward trend, the number of samples was considered insufficient, while if the end of the curve tended to be flat, the number of samples was considered sufficient22. The end of the species accumulation curves of Specaccums tended to be flat in this study; therefore, the sampling was considered sufficient to carry out data analysis (Fig. 9).

Results of alpha diversity analysis of the gut microbiota

In this study, six indicators, including the Chao1 index, observed species index, PD_whole_tree index, goods-coverage index, Shannon index, and Simpson's index, were analyzed to assess the species diversity of individual samples (Fig. 10). There was no significant difference in flora abundance or diversity between the normal, model, and HD groups in the EPA-treated group.

Results of beta diversity analysis of the gut microbiota

Beta diversity analysis was used to compare the differences in species diversity among intergroup samples, and the evolutionary distance between species was considered while calculating the results. The higher the index value, the greater the difference between the samples. In this study, the UniFrac results were divided into two parts: the weighted UniFrac, which considered the abundance of the sequence, and the unweighted UniFrac, which did not consider the abundance of the sequence. According to the statistical analysis of the differences of the clustered samples, the similarity of species composition among the samples was determined by calculating the distance between the samples23.

ANOSIM similarity analysis was used to determine the intergroup and intragroup differences, and the grouping was found to be meaningful (Fig. 11). The R value of the unweighted results was R = 0.34 > 0 and p = 0.001 < 0.05, indicating that the differences between the groups were significantly greater than those within the group (intragroup). Therefore, the result is reasonable, and the data are statistically significant. Thus, in this study, the gut microbiota in tumor-bearing mice tended to be normal after EPA treatment.

Figure 11 Anosim analysis of gut microbiota based on unweighted unifrac distance. Full size image

Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was used to evaluate the differences between samples (Fig. 12)24. If the samples were in close proximity, the species compositions of the samples were similar. The EPA-treated group was closer in distance to the normal group, indicating that both groups had similar gut microbiotas.

Difference Analysis of the Gut Microbiota

To emphasize the statistical significance and biological relevance, the LEFse analysis of the gut microflora was performed, and the results are presented quantitatively in an LDA Score column and a cladogram. This study aimed to estimate the impact of the abundance of each component and identify the significant difference effect on the division of samples23. The results showed significant differences in the gut microflora, such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Streptococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Alistipes (Nor), Campylobacterales, Epsilonproteobacteria, Helicobacteraceae, Helicobacter, Escherichia_Shigella, Subdoligranulum (Mod), Prevotellaceae, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidaceae, Bacteroides, and Selenomonadales (EPA) (Figs. 13 and 14).

Species abundance in the gut microbiota

Histograms showing species profiling in the gut microflora of each sample were used to identify the species with higher relative abundances and individual samples at different classification levels (Fig. 15A and Table 3)25. In this study, the phylum level showed that Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Proteobacteria accounted for more than 98% of the total microflora after the different treatments. Compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes decreased, but Proteobacteria increased in the model group. In contrast, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes increased, but Proteobacteria decreased in the EPA-treated group and was close to that in the normal group. Thus, the trend in the two phyla in the microflora in the EPA-treated group trended more toward that in the normal group.

Table 3 The relative abundance of the main gut microbiota at the phylum level in four groups. Full size table

Figure 15B shows the genus level of the gut microflora in the three groups. Based on abundance, the main groups were Lactobacillus, Bacteroidales_S24 − 7_group_norank, Bacteroidales, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 001, Alloprevotella, Streptococcus, Alistipes, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 003, and Helicobacter. Based on the changing trend in the abundance of the gut microflora, it can be concluded that tumor-bearing mice that were treated with EPA tended to be closer to those in the normal control group. Compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of beneficial microflora such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroidales_S24 − 7_group_norank, Bacteroidales, Alloprevotella and Alistipes in the model group decreased by 6.95%, 25.25%, 4.67%, 2.65%, and 0.68%, respectively; accordingly, compared with those in the model group, those in the EPA group increased by 10.67%, 19.94%, 1.34%, and 3.29%, respectively, which showed a significant reversion in the reduction in beneficial microflora in the model group. In contrast, compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of the harmful microflora Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 001, Helicobacter, and Prevotellaceae_UCG − 003 in the model group increased to 16.39%, 7.01%, 5.83%, and 8.81%, respectively, while those in the EPA-treated group decreased to 17.99%, 1.44%, 5.81%, and 3.33%, respectively.

It's been used by the Aztecs in Mexico and people living in the Lake Chad area in Africa for centuries. Spirulina's usually cultivated from bodies of water like lakes or farmed in ponds.

Spirulina contains several nutrients, including fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, and K), fatty acids (DHA, EPA), beta carotene and minerals. It's also a source of protein, but it lacks high enough levels of some of the amino acids that your body needs to function at its best (unless you have a medical condition where you need to avoid specific amino acids, like phenylketonuria or ""PKU""). Since spirulina comes from bacteria (specifically ""cyanobacteria""), it may be considered a protein source for vegans.

It's also important to note that the B12 in spirulina is in a different form as ""pseudovitamin B12"" than the type typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs, especially if you follow a vegetarian or vegan way of eating, which can be low in B12. Lower levels of B12 are also found in adults over the age of 60. And why's B12 important? Because your body needs B12 to make red blood cells, it's also crucial for brain and nerve cell development. Not getting enough B12 can cause tiredness, memory loss, depression, and even different types of anemia.

This article takes a closer look at the potential uses of spirulina and the risks associated with its use.

Dietary supplements are not regulated in the United States, meaning the FDA does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement that has been tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn’t mean that they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about any potential interactions with other supplements or medications.

Uses of Spirulina

Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare provider, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD/RDN), or pharmacist. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease.



Spirulina has fat-soluble vitamins (like A, E, and K), beta carotene and minerals, protein, and phycocyanins (pigments that produce a blue color and have shown antioxidant effects). Phycocyanins have been used as a dye in many industries, including pharmacy, culinary, and even cosmetics.

Scientists have studied, but not necessarily proven, spirulina's impact on different areas of health, including but not limited to:

We'll explore what the science says about spirulina's effectiveness for these health outcomes.



Antioxidant capacity

According to a meta-analysis (a collection of research studies) of nine studies with a total of 415 people, spirulina increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The studies used anywhere from one to eight grams of spirulina per day, a pretty extensive range. Many of the studies had a relatively small number of people, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much. The strength of the effects was not earth-shattering and was generally more substantial when people took five grams of spirulina per day or more.

The conclusion? Getting antioxidants from the foods that we eat can help reduce some of the inflammation in our bodies. To amp up antioxidants in your diet, try including a variety of the most nutrient-dense foods that you can source and afford - and they don't have to be organic - like whole grains, fruit, and vegetables to help increase your body's antioxidant capacity and reduce inflammation in your body. Just don't rely on spirulina alone.

Blood pressure

Scientists did a meta-analysis (a collection of several research studies on a topic) of five randomized controlled trials that included 230 people to check spirulina's effects on blood pressure. The people in the different studies took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina a day. The lengths of the studies were anywhere from two to 12 weeks, and many of the studies were pretty small, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much.

When the data was pooled (put together) and analyzed from these studies, the scientists said that spirulina lowered systolic blood pressure by about 4.59 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure 7.02 millimeters of mercury. Systolic pressure (top number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. Diastolic pressure (bottom number) measures the pressure your arteries experience between each heartbeat. The biggest blood pressure-lowering in the studies was seen in people who had high blood pressure already.

The scientists also said more high-quality studies are needed before we can start recommending that everyone with high blood pressure needs to start eating spirulina.

Blood sugar control

Have you ever gotten a jittery feeling after eating sugary food? That usually means your blood sugar's spiking. And this situation can be dire for people coping with conditions like type I or type II diabetes, disordered eating including diabulimia, and more.

Over time, blood sugar spikes that are left uncontrolled can actually lead to damage to your body. Worst case, in certain conditions like diabetes, that can look like having to surgically remove parts of your body (amputation), heart attacks, kidney failure, or stroke, which can lead to paralysis of parts of your body. While spirulina really would not likely be able to correct severe damage from uncontrolled blood sugar over time by itself, it has lowered blood sugar levels in human studies. And why? It could be its protein and fiber content, or perhaps it is phycocyanin's ability to help with inflammation. Scientists are still figuring it out.

Fourteen studies with 510 people with metabolic syndrome–a collection of symptoms like high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (""good cholesterol""), and high waist circumference, which altogether can create more severe health problems–were included in a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on blood sugar and other outcomes. And a lot of those studies didn't have many people in them, meaning they had lower statistical power. People took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina per day. Blood sugar and insulin levels were reduced in some of the studies after taking specific amounts of spirulina. More high-quality studies are needed before healthcare providers can recommend spirulina for lowering blood sugar and insulin levels.

Generally, working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN), particularly a Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist (CDCES), can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. RDs/RDNs can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to avoid spikes in your blood sugar, which could help you feel better. Remember, managing blood sugar can be challenging, and you don't have to do it alone!

Cancer

Unfortunately, very few well-conducted human studies have looked at spirulina's effects on cancer. There've been several studies in test tube cells or in animals that aren't humans. However, more well-constructed studies looking at its effects on humans are needed.



Cholesterol levels

Scientists conducted a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on cholesterol levels that had seven controlled trials for a total of 522 total people. They found that spirulina reduced: total cholesterol (by 46.76 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)), low-density lipoprotein (LDL by 41.32 milligrams per deciliter), and triglycerides (by 44.23 milligrams per deciliter). It also increased the ""good"" cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL by 6.06 milligrams per deciliter). Again, why did spirulina do this? We're not sure, but scientists think it may be due to its nutritional profile (fiber, fatty acids like DHA and EPA), its antioxidant capacity, or a combination of these.



While healthcare providers cannot recommend spirulina for lowering your cholesterol, they can suggest working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) to help you explore your eating patterns, movement, and more. Registered dietitian nutritionists can help you build your toolkit and your capacity. Again, you're not alone!

Liver health

Spirulina has been studied for its effects on liver health in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the study was very small (only 13 people), so we can't draw any conclusions about spirulina for NAFLD until larger and better studies are done.

Metabolic syndrome

Scientists have studied spirulina's effects on metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome happens when you have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist (excess abdominal fat). Metabolic syndrome can wreak havoc with your health and increases your odds of heart attack, stroke, and type two diabetes. One of metabolic syndrome's main causes is thought to be obesity. Obesity, however, can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass.

One spirulina meta-analysis pulled together data from 18 studies. It suggested that spirulina could help lower high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, which are all parts of metabolic syndrome. It's important to note that while spirulina may impact these outcomes, the most essential issue would be working on your current way of eating, your movement (exercise), and other equally important issues like addressing your emotional health. Spirulina can't solve these serious issues.

Consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and perhaps one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. In addition, they can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to help you feel better. Sometimes it can be challenging to give yourself permission to ask for and accept help. But you've got this. And you don't have to go at it alone.

Obesity

In a meta-analysis of five studies, scientists looked at spirulina's effects on weight management in people coping with obesity. Spirulina did decrease weight in people with obesity by 4.55 pounds and in people who were overweight by 2.82 pounds. However, clinically speaking, this is not enough to make a solid recommendation for use of spirulina for obesity treatment.

As mentioned previously, it's important to note that obesity can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass. And BMI does not give the complete picture of an individual's well-being. Consider requesting a body composition test (for example, skin-fold measurements or a DEXA Body Composition scan) from your healthcare provider in addition to other parameters that they may measure.

As mentioned above, consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and, ideally, one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). CSOWM RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. They can help you build your toolkit and your capacity, and help you feel better. You've got this.



What Are the Side Effects of Spirulina?

An allergic reaction may be possible in those allergic to spirulina. Allergic reactions would include rash or swelling. Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience side effects and call your healthcare provider.



Common Side Effects

Spirulina is generally safe, but some people have reported the following with its use:

Allergy

Headache

Muscle pain

Sweating

Trouble sleeping



Severe Side Effects

While severe side effects from spirulina are rare, be aware that the following have occurred:

Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

(severe allergic reaction) Throat swelling

Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience severe side effects and call your healthcare provider.

Precautions

People with phenylketonuria (inability to process the amino acid phenylalanine) and individuals with other amino acid disorders, for example, classical homocystinuria (HCU), or maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), may need to avoid spirulina due to its high protein and thus amino acid content.



The safety of spirulina in pregnant or nursing people has not been established. Speak with your healthcare provider before using spirulina if you're pregnant, plan to get pregnant or if you're breastfeeding.

Please don't give children supplements–including spirulina–without discussing this with their pediatrician first.

Spirulina can sometimes be contaminated with things like lead or other heavy metals (it grows in lakes, after all) or even toxins.



Dosage: How Much Spirulina Should I Take?

Always speak with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement to ensure that the supplement and dosage are appropriate for your individual needs.



Manufacturer recommendations might vary. As a general guideline though, don't use more than what's listed on your product's label. There's no recommended ""effective"" dosage of spirulina. Avoid spirulina if you're allergic or sensitive to it or any of its ingredients. Studies have used from one to 10 grams a day for up to six months to 19 grams of spirulina a day for up two months, with a relatively good safety profile in people with different conditions.



Again, please do not give supplements to children without first discussing this with their pediatrician.

What Happens If I Take Too Much Spirulina?

An upper limit or recommended intake is lacking for spirulina. Taking upwards of 40 grams per day for an unknown period of time has been noted. If you believe that you've taken too much spirulina, contact your healthcare provider for information.



Interactions

Blood thinners: While there are only about 0.26 micrograms of vitamin K in each gram of spirulina, taking far larger amounts could theoretically impact the blood-thinning effects of some medicines like Jantoven (warfarin).

Immunomodulators: Little evidence exists to support avoiding the use of spirulina with immunosuppressive drugs or drugs that change the way that the immune system works (immunomodulators).

It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included. Please review this supplement label with your healthcare provider to discuss any potential interactions with foods, other supplements, and medications.



How to Store Spirulina

Store spirulina in a cool, dry place. Keep spirulina away from direct sunlight. Discard as indicated by the ""use by"" date on the packaging. Keep away from children and pets.



Similar Supplements

Chlorella (a green algae supplement) is somewhat similar to spirulina.

Frequently Asked Questions Is spirulina the same as chlorella? No, chlorella and spirulina are different species of algae, but they're both supplements.

What antioxidants does spirulina have? Spirulina has phycocyanins.

If I'm a vegan, can I get all my protein and B12 needs from spirulina? While spirulina has most of the amino acids that your body needs, it doesn't have enough of some of them. Try to eat a balanced, varied diet to meet your unique protein needs. The B12 in spirulina–pseudovitamin B12–is in a different form than the type that's typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs.

Sources of Spirulina & What to Look For

Blue-green algae species used in spirulina supplements are typically Spirulina maxima, Spirulina platensis, or Aphanizomenon flos-aquae.



Just because a remedy is thought to be ""natural"" does not mean that it is safe. Some ""wild-crafted"" spirulina products may have been grown in water contaminated with heavy metals (mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium) or other pollutants. Opt for supplements produced in labs and certified by third-party authorities like the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF International.



As with all supplements, it's essential to talk with your healthcare provider before using spirulina to decide if it's right for you.

Accumulating Body Flab as You Age? Help Stop It With This,"Accumulating Body Flab as You Age? Help Stop It With This

This article was previously published April 8, 2019, and has been updated with new information.

In 2018, James DiNicolantonio, co-author of my book, “Superfuel,” published a groundbreaking paper,1 “Antioxidant Bilirubin Works in Multiple Ways to Reduce Risk for Obesity and Its Health Complications.”

Bilirubin is a breakdown product of red blood cells (heme) and the chemical responsible for the yellow color of bruises, urine and jaundice.

In that paper, DiNicolantonio explains how bilirubin inhibits NADPH oxidase (typically abbreviated as NOX) — a metabolic enzyme activated in a large number of pathological conditions that generates a great deal of oxidative stress — and how phycocyanobilin found in spirulina can exert similar effects.

The reason for this is because the phycocyanobilin found in spirulina is rapidly reduced to phycocyanorubin, a close homolog of bilirubin, in mammalian cells.2,3 In a follow-up paper4 published March 2019, DiNicolantonio, et.al, propose that elevated bilirubin might aid weight control by preventing the development of leptin resistance, and discuss evidence suggesting spirulina may be an effective way to combat leptin resistance as well.

Bilirubin Can Play a Role in Chronic Disease

When a newborn baby gets jaundice, he is placed under “bili lights” in the hospital nursery to prevent brain damage (kernicterus), should his bilirubin levels become too high. The blue lights break down the bilirubin so it can be excreted. However, at appropriate levels, bilirubin has a strong free radial scavenging effect.

Until recently, scientists were unaware that bilirubin may actually have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and atheroprotective properties, and there is a growing body of scientific and clinical evidence to support this.

From an evolutionary/biological perspective, it also makes sense that nature would have created a way for your body to break down heme,5 which can be toxic if it accumulates. The way bilirubin is thought to provide these health benefits is through its ability to inhibit NOX.

In fact, NOX overactivity appears to play a significant role in a wide range of health conditions, including but not limited to vascular diseases and vascular complications of other diseases (diabetes, kidney failure, blindness and heart disease, for example), insulin resistance, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, cancer, glaucoma, pulmonary fibrosis and erectile dysfunction.

It follows then that preventing many chronic diseases would require finding a means of inhibiting or modulating NOX. Bilirubin is believed to assist with this modulating effect.

People with Gilbert Syndrome comprise 3 to 7% of the population6,7 and illustrate this phenomenon quite nicely, as they are genetically predisposed to chronically elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin.

These individuals, having two to three times as much bilirubin as the rest of us after a 24-hour fast,8 enjoy a greatly reduced risk for coronary artery disease, hypertension, carotid atherosclerosis and overall mortality, and this protection is thought to be related to their high bilirubin levels.9

Spirulina — An Effective NADPH Oxidase Inhibitor

Since phycocyanobilin is a very close relative of bilirubin — and spirulina is a great source of phycocyanobilin — spirulina has enormous clinical potential due to its NOX inhibiting effect. This is why phycocyanobilin has been the focus of a large amount of research.

Phycobilin extracts have been shown to inhibit NOX activity in human aortic endothelium, aortic smooth muscle and renal cell cultures. And bilirubin protects against diabetic nephropathy via downregulation of NOX in rats.

As DiNicolantonio’s 2018 paper10 explains, bilirubin reduces the risk for obesity and related health problems through a number of mechanisms, but primarily by inhibiting NOX complexes.

Downregulating NOX activity — which can be done with spirulina, thanks to its bilirubin-mimicking phycocyanobilin — could therefore have “profound implications for preservation of metabolic and vascular health.” As further explained by the authors:

“Expression of inducible form of heme oxygenase, HO-1, can be boosted by oxidative stress — often derived from NADPH oxidase [NOX] activity; the resultant production of bilirubin feeds back to quell this oxidative stress …

[Phycocyanobilin, which is covalently attached to phycocyanin] is readily converted by biliverdin reductase to the bilirubin analogue phycocyanorubin, which appears to share bilirubin’s ability to inhibit NADPH oxidase [NOX] complexes. Arguably, this may largely explain the versatile antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of oral spirulina … in rodent studies …

A recent cross-sectional epidemiological study evaluating subjects with [Gilbert Syndrome] has discovered that [Gilbert Syndrome] is associated with a reduced tendency to gain body fat in later life … A reasonable deduction is that chronically elevated free unconjugated bilirubin — and perhaps an upregulation in intracellular bilirubin generation — somehow opposes age-related gain in body fat.

Of related interest is a study showing that intraperitoneal administration of bilirubin — administered daily for 14 days — inhibits weight gain in rats fed a diet high in fats and sugar. Bilirubin injections were also found to prevent deterioration of glucose tolerance …

A credible case can be made that the favorable impact of elevated bilirubin on risk for undesirable weight gain reflects preservation of hypothalamic leptin sensitivity …

Activation of NADPH oxidase [NOX] is a key mediator of proinflammatory microglial activation; hence, elevated bilirubin might be expected to support effective leptin function in the arcuate nucleus, thereby aiding appetite control.

Oxidative stress in adipocytes, stemming largely from NADPH oxidase [NOX] activity, appears to play a key role in the induction of insulin resistance and the skewing of adipokine and cytokine production in hypertrophied adipocytes.

Hence, bilirubin and heme oxygenase activity could be expected to aid maintenance of adipocyte insulin sensitivity. Indeed, plasma levels of unconjugated bilirubin have been found to correlate inversely with risk for metabolic syndrome and diabetes in prospective epidemiological studies, as confirmed in a recent meta-analysis.

In both cross-sectional and prospective studies, higher plasma bilirubin levels are associated with better insulin sensitivity and decreased risk for metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes — independent of BMI … A direct protective effect of bilirubin on adipocyte function may be largely responsible for this phenomenon.”

Leptin Resistance: A Hallmark of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes

In order for you to significantly gain weight, you must first become leptin resistant. Leptin is a hormone that helps you regulate your appetite. When your leptin levels rise, it signals your body that you’re full, so you’ll stop eating.

However, as you become increasingly resistant to the effects of leptin, you end up eating more. The question then is: what drives this basic process? Why do you become leptin resistant in the first place?

Research by Dr. Richard Johnson — head of nephrology at the University of Colorado who has published more than 500 medical papers and written a number of books on obesity — clearly shows that refined sugar (in particular fructose) is exceptionally effective at causing leptin resistance in animals and blocks the burning of fat.

Most overweight Americans have some degree of insulin and leptin resistance. This also includes people with diabetes, and many individuals with high blood pressure or high cholesterol. If you fall into this category, it would be prudent for you to restrict fructose to about 15 to 25 grams per day from all sources.

In his most recent paper,11 DiNicolantonio and his co-authors hypothesize that spirulina supplementation may also be an effective treatment for leptin resistance.

Bilirubin Protects Against Weight Gain

As mentioned earlier, people with Gilbert Syndrome are genetically predisposed to chronically elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin. This not only appears to protect them from heart disease and overall mortality, but also prevents body fat accumulation, especially during later years, and hypothalamic leptin resistance is one known condition that promotes weight gain as you grow older.12

Research has shown that leptin injections have no effect on obesity. “Studies in rodents with diet-induced obesity suggest that this phenomenon reflects a loss of leptin responsiveness that is specific to the arcuate nucleus,” DiNicolantonio notes.13

Research also suggests that diet-induced obesity is related to the activation of microglia (glial cells that function as scavengers) in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH).14 Again, NOX plays an important role. Activation of microglia also leads to the production of toxic oxidants such as peroxynitrite and other proinflammatory cytokines.

As noted by DiNicolantonio, “Hence, it is straightforward to propose that bilirubin may have the ability to downregulate microglial activation by diminishing NADPH oxidase activation.” That said, bilirubin does not appear to be able to influence leptin activity until or unless leptin resistance has actually developed.

Spirulina May Combat Leptin Resistance by Mimicking Bilirubin

Now, while raising your bilirubin level could potentially protect you from obesity and diabetes, it’s not a useful nutraceutical in and of itself, and this is where spirulina comes in, as the phycocyanobilin found in spirulina is very similar to bilirubin. DiNicolantonio sums it up as follows:15

“If the hypothesis presented here is correct, the far lower body fat in older subjects with Gilbert Syndrome reflects the ability of bilirubin to suppress the activation and proliferation of microglia in the MBH.

The extent to which this expansion of activated microglia — and the associated impact on the function of leptin-responsive neurons — can be reversed by elevation of bilirubin (or administration of phycocyanobilin) in patients who have already developed obesity with leptin resistance remains to be seen.

Particularly because microglial mass increases, it may be rash to assume that this syndrome is fully reversible. If phycocyanobilin does prove to have utility for controlling hypothalamic inflammation, its greatest impact on obesity will likely be achieved by long-term administration in a preventive mode.

In any case, studies evaluating the impact of bilirubin or phycocyanobilin administration on the development of hypothalamic leptin resistance in fat-fed rodents appear to be warranted … Two studies have been published very recently in which inclusion of spirulina in the diet has been shown to inhibit gain in body weight and fat in rats fed a high-fat diet; these appear to be the first studies to have evaluated spirulina’s impact in this regard.

Although neither of these studies focused on leptin function, the fact that markers of adipose tissue browning were higher in rats receiving spirulina is consistent with effective leptin function in these rats.

Moreover, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial has also emerged, in which spirulina supplementation (at only 2 grams daily) was found to potentiate loss of body fat, body weight, waist circumference and BMI in overweight subjects placed on a calorie-restricted diet; reductions in triglycerides and C reactive protein were also greater in the spirulina group.

Bilirubin mimesis [imitation or mimicry] may represent one example of a more general strategy for preventing or reversing inappropriate weight gain: counteracting hypothalamic leptin resistance or upregulating hypothalamic leptin signaling.”

Spirulina Types, Dosing and Potential Adverse Reactions

There are many types of spirulina on the market, so do your homework before making a purchase. Since spirulina grown in an uncontrolled environment has the potential to become contaminated with heavy metals and other toxins, it is important to choose organic spirulina from a reputable source.

Spirulina comes in capsules, tablets, powders and flakes. Dosing depends on what you plan to use it for and to whom it is given. A general starting dose for adults is typically around 3 grams. For disease prevention, you may work your way up to 20 grams per day. The adult maintenance dose is typically around 10 grams a day.

Remember to increase your intake of spring water or filtered water when taking spirulina to help it absorb into your system. Also be aware that spirulina is a potent detoxifier, so depending on your toxic burden, you may or may not experience a detox reaction. For that reason, it is best to start with a small dose and work your way up.

Though there are no known side effects associated with spirulina, your body may react to it based on your current state of health. Some of the most prominent reactions you may experience include:

Slight fever — The high protein content in spirulina increases metabolism, which may elevate body temperature Dark green stool — Spirulina can remove accumulated waste products in your colon, which may cause darker stool. Also, spirulina is high in chlorophyll, which turns your stool green Gas — Buildup of gas may indicate that your digestive system is not functioning properly Excitability — Your body is converting protein into heat energy, which may cause temporary feelings of restlessness Breakouts and/or itchy skin — This is caused by the colon cleansing process and is a temporary reaction Sleepiness — This is caused by the detoxification process and may indicate your body is exhausted and needs more rest

Also keep in mind that while spirulina is entirely natural and generally considered a healthy food, there are some important contraindications you need to be aware of. Avoid spirulina if you are:16

Severely allergic to seafood

Allergic to iodine

Pregnant

Nursing

If you have hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), consult your health care provider before taking spirulina. Also avoid taking spirulina if you are currently running a fever, as it may raise it further. Also, do not take spirulina if you have an autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, or if you a metabolic condition called phenylketonuria (PKU).

Chlorella — An Alternative if You Can’t Tolerate Spirulina

Chlorella is another form of algae that is sometimes confused with spirulina. The fundamental difference between spirulina and chlorella is that spirulina does not possess the hard cell wall that makes chlorella closer to a plant than algae. Note, however, that chlorella does not have the phycocyanobilin so it will not inhibit NOX and increase NADPH.

Chlorella is an excellent way to detoxify your body from mercury, a common problem if you have amalgam dental fillings, have received a thimerosal-containing vaccine or regularly eat contaminated fish. It is also one of nature’s highest source of chlorophyll, which has many biological benefits.

Spirulina is unable to remove heavy metals, as it lacks a cell membrane. It can, however, protect your liver against the toxic effects of heavy metals, and help eliminate other toxins, including arsenic. If for whatever reason you cannot tolerate spirulina, chlorella could be a viable alternative to obtain some of its benefits described above.

Toxic To-Go Containers Linked to Liver Disease,"Fluorinated chemicals known as polyfluoroalkyl or perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFASs), which include PFOA and PFOS, can be found in most Americans.1 The widely used chemicals have been added to industry and consumer products since the 1940s, but while PFOA and PFOS have been phased out in the U.S. due to their toxic properties, other PFAS are still in use.

Because the chemicals break down very slowly in the environment, they’ve been dubbed “forever chemicals,” and there’s concern that exposure to these toxins may be a significant contributor to liver disease, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).2

Liver Disease Is a Public Health Epidemic

NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in developed countries,3 characterized by a buildup of excess fat in your liver that is not related to heavy alcohol use. Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, weight and smoking all play important roles in exacerbating (as well as reducing) your chances of developing some form of liver disease.

While alcohol consumption certainly doesn’t help liver health, the rise in NAFLD is likely related more so to increased intake of toxic industrially processed seed oils, often referred to as vegetable oils, along with exposure to environmental chemicals, including PFAS.

Globally, about 25% of people are affected by NAFLD. In the U.S., prevalence is expected to rise to 100.9 million, or about one-third of adults, by 2030. Without proper treatment, NAFLD can lead to serious liver problems including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.4

Exposure to PFAS Linked to Liver Disease

PFAS are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that accumulate in body tissues, such as the liver, and are known to accelerate metabolic changes that lead to fatty liver. “This bioaccumulation,” researchers wrote in Environmental Health Perspectives, “coupled with the long half-lives of many PFAS, leads to concern about the potential for PFAS to disrupt liver homeostasis should they continue to accumulate in human tissue even if industrial use is abated.”5

The researchers, from the Keck School of Medicine of USC, conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, yielding 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies. Four types of PFAS — PFOS, PFOA, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) — accounted for most known human exposure.

The study compared PFAS exposure to indicators of liver injury including serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), NAFLD, NASH or steatosis, a buildup of fat in the liver. Meta-analysis from the human studies showed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA, PFOS and PFNA.

In addition, exposure to PFOA was also linked to higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels — two widely used markers of liver disease — in humans. Rodents were also affected, with those exposed to PFAS tending to have higher ALT levels and steatosis.6 “There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies,” the researchers concluded.7

While it’s unknown exactly how PFAS may be damage the liver, its hepatotoxicity may be due to a combination of the following:8

Promotion of liver inflammation and triglyceride accumulation

Altered lipid metabolism

Reduced bioavailability of choline, triggering steatosis due to choline deficiency. Choline, an essential nutrient, supports normal liver function and liver health, helping it to maintain membrane integrity and manage cholesterol metabolism, including low density lipoproteins and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), helping to move fat out of your liver 9

They pointed out that newer PFAS, which have been used to replace the “legacy” PFAS that were phased out of use in the early 2000s, have similar chemical structure and properties, and therefore likely have similarly toxic effects.

Also unknown are what effects these ubiquitous chemicals have after combined exposures, as well as risks of exposure to the most vulnerable populations — infants, including in utero, and children. “This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PFAS, mixtures and early life exposures,” they explained.10

“We see that the prevalence of NAFLD in humans is increasing but the explanations are unclear,” said study author Sarah Rock in a news release. “Though the human research connecting PFAS to liver disease is limited, there is much evidence in animal research showing hepatotoxicity of PFAS.

A challenge for PFAS researchers is that humans are exposed to mixtures of hundreds if not thousands of these chemicals. Mixture analyses is one potential tool for addressing this complexity in the future.”11 Study author Elizabeth Costello added:12

“This research clearly shows that PFAS need to be taken seriously as a human health concern because even after they are phased out, they persist in the environment. There is enough evidence, we believe, to demonstrate a need to clean up sources of exposure to PFAS and to prevent future exposures.”

PFAS Pose a Significant Risk to Human Health

It’s not only the liver that suffers from exposure to PFAS. In May 2015, more than 200 scientists from 40 countries signed the Madrid Statement, which warns about the harms of PFAS chemicals and documents the following potential health effects of exposure:13

Liver toxicity Disruption of lipid metabolism, and the immune and endocrine systems Adverse neurobehavioral effects Neonatal toxicity and death Tumors in multiple organ systems Testicular and kidney cancers Liver malfunction Hypothyroidism High cholesterol Ulcerative colitis Reduced birth weight and size Obesity Decreased immune response to vaccines Reduced hormone levels and delayed puberty

Exposure to high levels of PFAS is also known to affect the immune system, and evidence from both human and animal studies shows that such exposure reduces antibody responses to vaccines and may also reduce your resistance to infectious disease.14 The U.S. EPA also acknowledges that PFAS exposure is harmful and states that peer-reviewed scientific studies have shown exposure to PFAS may cause:15

Reproductive effects such as decreased fertility or increased high blood pressure in pregnant women Developmental effects or delays in children, including low birth weight, accelerated puberty, bone variations or behavioral changes Increased risk of some cancers, including prostate, kidney and testicular cancers Reduced ability of the body’s immune system to fight infections, including reduced vaccine response Interference with the body’s natural hormones Increased cholesterol levels and/or risk of obesity

Food Packaging Is an Overlooked Source of Exposure

If you’re wondering how you may be exposed to these toxic chemicals, food packaging is a common culprit, particularly for fast food and processed foods. Grease-resistant to-go containers, papers and wrappers often contain PFAS. This includes fast food containers and wrappers, microwave popcorn bags, pizza boxes and candy wrappers.16 Even foods from health food stores like Whole Foods may be packaged in containers loaded with PFAS.

In fact, a 2018 study released by consumer watchdog groups Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families and Toxic-Free Future revealed that Whole Foods Market was the biggest offender in their analysis of paper products coming in contact with food. They found high levels of fluorine — a sign that the packaging contains PFAS — in five of the 17 items tested, four of which were containers in the salad and hot food bar.17

In another study, about one-third of the approximately 400 fast food wrappers and containers tested were found to contain fluorine, which suggests perfluorinated chemicals were used to give the paper a slick surface, making it oil- and grease-resistant. “We found that 46% of food contact papers and 20% of paperboard samples contained detectable fluorine,” the researchers explained.18

Since the chemicals migrate into food and contaminate compost piles and landfills after disposal, the use of PFAS leads to unnecessary long-term exposure to harmful chemicals for humans, wildlife and the environment, especially since PFAS-free packaging options are widely available.

How Else Are You Exposed to PFAS?

PFAS can be found in water, soil, air and food. They are in your home, including in household products like stain- and water-repellant fabrics, cleaning products, nonstick cookware and paint — and likely in your drinking water.

According to a 2016 Harvard study, 16.5 million Americans have detectable levels of at least one kind of PFAS in their drinking water, and about 6 million Americans are drinking water that contains PFAS at or above the EPA safety level.19 The highest concentration levels of PFAS were found in watersheds near industrial sites, military fire training areas and wastewater treatment plants. Private wells have also been found to be contaminated.

PFAS have no taste or smell, so it’s wise for virtually everyone to filter their water with a high-quality carbon filtration system. To be certain you’re getting the purest water you can, filter the water both at the point of entry and at the point of use.

You can also be exposed to PFAS by eating seafood caught in water contaminated with the chemicals, by swallowing contaminated soil or dust and by using PFAS-containing personal care products, which include shampoo, dental floss, nail polish, eye makeup and more.20

Given these chemicals’ pervasive and persistent use, everyone would be well served by following the Madrid Statement’s recommendation to avoid products containing, or manufactured using, PFAS, which include most that are stain-resistant, waterproof or nonstick. To further reduce your exposure, the Environmental Working Group recommends avoiding:21

Items that have been pretreated with stain repellants; opt out of such treatments when buying new furniture and carpets. Water- and/or stain-repellant clothing. One tipoff is when an item made with artificial fibers is described as “breathable.” These are typically treated with PTFE. Items treated with flame retardant chemicals, which includes a wide variety of baby items, padded furniture, mattresses and pillows. Instead, opt for naturally less flammable materials such as leather, wool and cotton. Fast food and carry out foods, as the wrappers are typically treated with PFAS. Microwave popcorn. PFAS not only may be present in the inner coating of the bag, it also may migrate to the oil from the packaging during heating. Instead, use “old-fashioned” stovetop popcorn. Nonstick cookware and other treated kitchen utensils. Healthier options include ceramic and enameled cast iron cookware, both of which are durable, easy to clean and completely inert, which means they won’t release any harmful chemicals into your home. A newer type of nonstick cookware called Duralon uses a nonfluoridated nylon polymer for its nonstick coating. While this appears to be safe, your safest bet is still ceramic and enameled cast iron. Oral-B Glide floss and any other personal care products containing PTFE or “fluoro” or “perfluoro” ingredients.

University of Calgary researchers discover a green way to make natural blue dye,"At first, researchers Agasteswar Vadlamani and Angela Kouris were trying to find ways to produce carbon-neutral gas with organisms unique to British Columbia's Soda Lakes.

But instead, the microbial goo lead the team to a business opportunity: a natural way to create blue colourant. It's food-safe, could have health benefits and, best of all, removes CO2 from the atmosphere.

It all started with a bit of a eureka moment, when Vadlamani saw the bacteria in their lab pond was emitting a beautiful blue colour — phycocyanin. So, he approached the research team, urging them to switch gears.

""I mean, that is just like a single aha moment,"" he said. ""I realized that focusing on this has better value proposition compared to bioenergy.""

That's when they created their company: Synergia Biotech. From thereon in, the team threw themselves into commercialization — an unexpected but exciting pivot.

""That's what drives me every day,"" Vadlamani said. ""We are always excited about new discoveries, it feels great.""

Typically, Kouris said, the blue dye you see in food, wine and blue jeans is created by the same synthetic process.

There are studies showing these dyes aren't the best for your health and can be carcinogenic. Finding blue in naturally-occurring settings, she added, is quite rare.

The researchers used a biological process in a pond at the University of Calgary campus to test the concept. (Katy Whitt Photography)

The most exciting part of the process, Kouris said, is that it's environmentally friendly.

Their production harnesses a naturally-occurring bacteria known as cyanobacteria — with a little sunlight, and drawing from CO2 in the air, they are able to harvest and concentrate the blue colour into a powder.

""We're the only company, the only innovation out there that has found a way to produce phycocyanin by capturing carbon in the atmosphere,"" Kouris said. ""All other technologies rely on carbon intensive processes.""

With their model, Kouris said they also see a new revenue stream in the Canadian agricultural field.

Right now, a big obstacle is scaling up, so the company is building a facility to help up production which should be ready to go in 2022.",,[],[]
"Venus sounds like the last place for life, but…could photosynthesis happen in its clouds?","Raging with unbearable heat and covered in swirls of toxic clouds, Venus is a hell world for humans. But something might actually be able to live in its atmosphere.

The clouds of sulfuric acid above Venus could — at least hypothetically — be a haven for photosynthesis. No alien algae or other photosynthetic organisms have actually been found there yet, but biochemist Rakesh Mogul of California State Polytechnic University recently led a study, published in Astrobiology, about how this could happen. What is poison for one life-form could make it possible for another to survive.

Venus is a place where even spacecraft fear to tread. Every lander that has touched the radiation-blasted surface has met an untimely death. Far above that surface, its skies might have some hidden advantages for hypothetical phototrophs, organisms that use light as an energy source to power up their metabolisms.

“We found that several packets of wavelengths, which pass through Venus’ atmosphere, overlap with the absorption properties of many terrestrial photosynthetic pigments,” he tells SYFY WIRE. “The light that remains in the clouds represents the groups of wavelengths available for photosynthesis.”

Phycocyanin, which gives cyanobacteria (aka blue-green algae) its unearthly blue color, could possibly thrive in the Venusian clouds, since it can absorb the wavelengths of light that come through. These wavelengths are similar to those that can be absorbed by photosynthetic organisms on Earth. (Some people swear by it as a supplement. No, really.) So could bacteriochlorophyll b, which offers an assist to organisms that photosynthesize wavelengths of light that most plants and cyanobacteria cannot use. These phototropic bacteria do not release oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis.

Searching for extraterrestrial life means recognizing substances and processes close to those on our planet while also being prepared to find life as we don’t know it or don’t usually recognize it. After light scatters through Earth’s atmosphere, what is available for photosynthesis remains on the surface as opposed to the leftovers lingering in the clouds of Venus. However, heat from the infernal surface of Venus rises up to the atmosphere. Both that and heat in the atmosphere itself include photons whose wavelengths are an asset to some photosynthetic pigments.

While that might sound conducive to something like algae or phytoplankton thriving, how could they make it in noxious clouds of sulfur dioxide that are constantly irradiated by the Sun?

“The clouds in Venus have substantial abundances of sulfur dioxide and other unidentified chemical species that absorb and scatter UV and visible radiation, scrubbing the atmosphere of most of the harmful UV rays,” Mogul says.

What results from this is ammonium bisulfate and other neutralized forms of sulfuric acid that were observed to show higher water activity than what was previously assumed. This is because of molecular properties that have certain effects on water molecules. Sulfuric acid is something of a double agent before it is neutralized, because while it reacts with H2O, it also sticks to it, making less water available for living things. Ammonium bisulfate, which is also less acidic, doesn’t stick nearly as well, freeing up that water for other types of chemical reactions.

So much for the clouds of Venus being supposedly too dry and acidic to support anything that would need water to stay alive.

Even more amazing is that photosynthesis could even be possible at night on Venus. It already happens in environments with hardly any light on Earth, such as hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean. The photon fluxes on Venus were found to be much higher than those on Earth. Meaning, heat and light do not scatter and vanish as quickly in the gases of the Venusian atmosphere as they do in water. Light energy in thermal or infrared forms, possibly both, rises from the surface and is retained in the clouds. Phototrophs would never want for photons.

“Venus’ surface is just so hot that a major amount of thermal radiation is given off, this makes the atmosphere hot,” Mogul says. “Together, the surface and atmosphere release photons of light due to the heat, which then rise into the clouds.”

Whether there are alien things swarming in the clouds of Venus is still unknown, but if something like that is ever discovered, the find shouldn’t be completely unexpected.",,[],[]

Marine bioactive compounds against SARS-CoV-2,"In the current era, viruses pose a significant threat to humans since they are capable of causing pandemics throughout the world. Changing environments, globalization, urbanization, population growth, and changes in transport and infrastructure have created new opportunities for viral infections to start and spread.

Review: Multifaceted role of natural sources for COVID-19 pandemic as marine drugs. ​​​​​​​Image Credit: Charlotte Bleijenberg / Shutterstock

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2019 in Wuhan, China, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus binds to the host ACE2 receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The RBD interacts with a lysine residue on the ACE2 receptor which makes it a potential pharmaceutical target. Infection with this virus results in end-stage respiratory illness, systemic involvement, and even death. Though several COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, they cannot be relied upon entirely, so additional treatments are needed.

Natural products are still considered one of the most common sources of antibacterial and antiviral medication. For several decades marine plants and microorganisms have been used in scientific inquiry. Marine creatures have developed various anti-infective techniques and chemicals to defend themselves against viruses and microorganisms that reside in the ocean. There are several advantages to utilizing these marine resources due to their ecological safety, physiological compatibility, and low toxin levels.

Antiviral properties of several natural substances derived from marine resources are currently being studied against COVID-19. Some of the compounds show similar efficacy, while few are more potent than the approved drugs. One such example is Phycocyanobilins (PCBs) and sulfated polysaccharides that bind and inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with higher affinity as compared to the traditional drug remdesivir. Natural inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) that is derived from marine microorganisms and sponges has been reported to protect against severe COVID-19. Additionally, various marine metabolites that are derived from scleractinian-related animals, algae, and sponges have been found to interact with a major SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro. Mpro is an enzyme that plays an important role in viral replication and transcription. Marine-derived compounds can also target SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (S), nucleocapsid proteins (N), matrix glycoproteins (M), tiny envelope proteins (E) as well as 3CLpro, which is also involved in replication, transcription, and maturation of the virus.

A new review paper published in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research aimed to determine the possibilities of using biologically active compounds derived from various chemical classes of marine organisms against SARS-CoV-2 infection at various stages of the life cycle of the virus.

COVID-19 viral pathogenesis

Coronaviruses have two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. Coronavirinae subfamily comprises four genera, alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus whose genome is enveloped and connected to a nucleoprotein (N). The membrane (M) and envelope protein (E) help in virus assembly, while the spike protein (S) helps in the entry of the virus inside the host cell. Non-structural proteins that help in the viral lifecycle are 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, and papain-like protease (PLpro).

Immune response and symptoms of COVID-19

SARS-CoV-2 can attack the respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, kidney, liver, heart, and central nervous system and cause multiple organ failures. The initial immunological response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection is the release of cytokines and immune-cell infiltration that results in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 in most patients. However, in the case of serious disease, a downregulation of immune response has been observed.

COVID-19 symptoms can range from moderate to severe, with headache, nasal congestion, loss of taste and smell, fever, sore throat, breathing difficulties, muscle pain, and diarrhea being the most common symptoms.

Coronavirus lifecycle and targets for the development of antiviral agents

The SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle begins with the interaction of the spike protein RBD with the ACE2 receptor that is expressed on the endothelial surface in the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Thereafter, the virus enters inside the host cell through the fusion of the viral and host cell membrane along with endocytosis with the help of the spike protein’s S2 subunit.

The cellular protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the spike protein once the spike protein-ACE2 complex is formed leading to the fusion with the host membrane and release of the viral genome. Other proteases such as plasmin, trypsin, and factor Xa are also involved in the process. Endocytosis is brought about by endolysosomes furin and cathepsin B/L (CatB/L). Therefore, therapies that can prevent one or more events in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2 are now being developed with the important targets being receptor binding and membrane fusion.

Inhibitors of unspecific attachment of the virus to the factors on the host cell surface

Unspecific attachment can help to raise the viral particle concentrations in the environment, thereby leading to higher infection rates. The attachment and penetration inhibitors can bind to virus receptor molecules on the surface of susceptible cells, to an intermediate, “activated” version of viral protein, and to specific proteins directly in the virion to prevent any further structural changes. These inhibitors can be used in antiviral drugs. A few of the common inhibitors are lectins and glycosaminoglycan mimetics.

Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that can recognize and reversibly bind to complex glycoconjugates moieties without affecting any covalent structures. Species that include lectins are algae, marine corals, fungi, prokaryotes, higher plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates. Mannose-binding lectins are quite important in antiviral research since they can prevent virus self-assembly during replication.

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long sulfated polysaccharides whose expression occurs on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix. SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses use GAGs for the attachment to host cells. Cell surface glycoproteins can interact with GAG to mimic heparinoid polysaccharides leading to the formation of a protective barrier that prevents viral binding.

Inhibitors of viral lipid‑dependent attachment to host cells

Lipids are important in the life cycle of viruses since they can act as direct receptors or cofactors for entry of virus entrance on the cell surface and in endosomes. In addition, certain viruses also utilize lipid rafts for some stages of their reproductive cycle.

Lipids can be altered by sterols that can be used to restrict viral replication. Other compounds such as sphingolipids and cyclodextrin can also inhibit the infectivity of several viruses, including coronaviruses. Sterols can be found in many organisms such as Arthropoda, porifera, algae, echinodermata, tunicata, mollusks, coelenterata, bryozoa, and chordates.

Inhibitors of specific receptors and fusion of cytoplasmic and viral membranes

Compounds that interact with the spike protein and proteases can prevent the entry of the virus inside the cell and subsequent infection. Therefore, they can be used as antiviral agents. This includes ACE2 inhibitors, TMPRSS2 inhibitors as well as biologically active substances such as flavonoids, terpenes, and peptides.

Virion deproteinization

Deproteinization of the virus takes place by surface-bound proteases like TMPRSS2 and cysteine proteases in endosomes as well as other proteases such as 3CLpro, PL2pro, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and helicase. Inhibiting these proteases can interfere with the life cycle of the virus and prevent infection.

Phlorotannins, lipids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and flavonoids are reported to be important compounds that can serve as inhibitors of the major SARS-CoV-2 proteases.

Marine bioactive compounds that can act against SARS‑CoV‑2

Major marine compounds that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection are derived from Scleractinia, an order of Anthozoa which is only found in the marine environment. Approximately 15 chemicals have been derived from Scleractinia-associated organisms that have the potential to inhibit viral infection.

Other compounds such as phycocyanin, polysaccharides, lutein, vitamin E, and B12, are also derived from marine algae. One polysaccharide, lambda carrageenan which is isolated from marine red algae, has antibacterial, antiviral, anti-coagulant, and anti-cancerous properties. Both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus have been reported to be inhibited by it.

Furthermore, two Scleractinia-related metabolites have been found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, while three were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Marine compounds derived from the Aplysinidae family, Petrosia stronglyophora sp., as well as the soft coral Pterogorgia citrina can also act as inhibitors of Mpro. Other marine compounds such as PCBs and polysaccharides such as carrageenan, fucoidan, and alginate have also been identified to play a significant role in virus protection.

Clinical studies on iota-carrageenan–containing lozenges and iota-carrageenan nasal spray have revealed antiviral efficacy against influenza A, human coronaviruses, and human rhinovirus. Carrageenan-treated coronavirus-infected individuals were observed to have a shorter duration of illness and fewer relapses as compared to untreated individuals. Nucleoside inhibitors mycalisine A and B derived from marine sponge Mycale sp were also found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RdRp with greater efficacy as compared to traditional drugs such as remdesivir.

Benefits of marine sulfated polysaccharides (SPs) over other natural compounds

Marine algae thus have been identified as an excellent source of a wide range of bioactive chemicals that have antiviral, anti-coagulant, immunomodulating, cancer-fighting, and antioxidant capabilities. Recent research has highlighted the potential of marine macroalgal blooms as a never-ending source of biologically active chemicals that will lead to new therapies.

These compounds are biocompatible, safe, and biodegradable. Additionally, algae-based SPs have lower manufacturing costs as compared to plant-derived natural chemicals. Also, marine SPs being water-soluble, can be extracted using an aqueous extraction technique, making them useful in pharmaceutical businesses as their characteristics can be readily changed. Furthermore, SPs have not been linked to any known health risks in pharmaceuticals, although further research is required on their chemical characteristics, bioavailability, toxicity, and biological processes.

Conclusion

According to the current review, several marine chemicals might be quite effective against SARS-CoV-2. Certain marine compounds can be a better choice as compared to chemically manufactured medicines for the treatment of severe COVID-19. Marine resources are also cost-effective due to their large quantity and variety. The advancements in bioinformatics techniques, investigations on gene mutations, and multi-omics technologies can provide a potential solution to the current limitations regarding marine drug development. Further research on novel resources derived from the sea might produce promising therapeutics for COVID-19 patients.

Limitations

Marine drug development faces certain obstacles. A major concern is that, despite the fact that the sea is home to many species, they are not easily accessible. A steady supply of chemicals is required to continue preclinical and clinical studies and further development of the drugs.",,[],[]
Spirulina benefits: Effects of spirulina on sport performances,"Spirulina is type of blue-green algae rich in nutrients and antioxidants and it is also one of the most popular nutritional supplements in the world. As a result, spirulina is associated with a number of positive health effects, most notably effects which apply to the area of sport performances.

Here, we take a closer look at how spirulina affects sporting performances.

First of all, spirulina is 55-70 percent protein, which is a percentage significantly larger than those of beef (25 percent protein) and eggs (13 percent). Therefore, this makes spirulina a key source of long-lasting energy for athletes, whilst assisting them with muscle growth and improving stamina.

Given that it is algae, it is also far easier than the likes of lentils, beef and cow's milk to digest, as there is no extra cell membrane to break down. Whilst the net protein use of spirulina is around 52 percent, those of lentils, beef and cow's milk are 30 percent, 15 percent and 12 percent respectively.

Furthermore, spirulina contains a pigment called phycocyanin which gives it its unique blue-green colour. It is a key antioxidant which assists athletes with anti-inflammation. This can be a significant aid to athletes given the amount of physical stress which they endure on a regular basis.

What other health benefits does spirulina bring?

Aside from a strictly sporting perspective, there is evidence that spirulina may have anti-cancer properties and that it may reduce blood pressure.

For example, in a recent study in India involving 87 people with precancerous lesions, among those who took one gram of spirulina per day for one year 45 percent of these people saw the lesions disappear.

With regards to a reduction in blood pressure, a dose of 4.5 grams per day has been proven to reduce the blood pressure of individuals with normal levels.",,[],[]
This new blue beer is already selling out in France,"Several years back, blue wine was making headlines in France. Now in 2022, it’s blue beer that’s creating a bit of a stir.

Hoppy Urban Brew (aka HUB) — based in the city of Roubaix, not far from the Belgian border — teamed up with a company called Etika Spirulina which grows spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, that is then supplied to the brewery to give the beer its blue hue, according to Reuters. The hope is that the eye-catching drink — which gets its colour from the compound phycocyanin — can also help Etika Spirulina promote its algae as a dietary supplement.

The blue beer is in demand

“It’s getting an enormous amount of interest and curiosity on the part of the public,” Sebastien Verbeke, a brewery employee, told the news outlet. HUB is reportedly already working on ramping up production after 1,500 bottles of the 3-percent ABV brew (which is called Line) sold out over the last three months of 2021.

Despite its blue colour, the beer itself is billed as a session IPA. “It’s quite disconcerting,” HUB’s Mathilde Vanmansart explained while tasting the beer, “because since it’s blue, our brains expect a certain note, but, no, we really have here a session IPA, a very light beer, and the flavours of the beer really come through. We can taste that it has a light alcohol content with quite the taste of hops, with slight notes of citrus. And in the back of the mouth, there’s a slight taste of lychee. It’s quite refreshing.”

Of course, after 40 years of craft beer, seemingly everything has been done before. We’ve seen a blue beer coloured with blue seaweed in Japan, covered a green “algae” beer in Ohio (though it wasn’t actually made with algae) — and, yes, a quick search on Untappd shows that, indeed, breweries have tossed spirulina in beers before to help coax out a blue hue. But when it comes to convincing people to consume algae, every bit helps, right?

Predicting Climate Change Driven Toxic Algae Blooms With Intelligent Fluorescence Sensor Technology,"Water resource engineers and managers responsible for the safety of municipal drinking water systems, raw water supply storage projects and busy summer water recreational areas popular for swimming or fishing will find the sophisticated Model EV82 Environmental Sensor Series from Electro Chemical Devices helps them detect rising chlorophyll levels accurately and reliably in their efforts to prevent toxic harmful algae blooms (HABs).

Scientists around the globe who are studying climate change point increasingly to its effects on the quality of the water supply. Drought conditions as well as rising industrial and agricultural activity have been blamed in part for the increasing organic load nutrient levels from fertilizers and other run-off pollutants in surface water that lead to rising seasonal chlorophyll growth levels, which are ripe for full toxic algae blooms causing more environmental damage.

Detecting rising levels of chlorophyll and algae in water samples helps water engineers ensure proper disinfection and effective treatment of surface water to protect municipal drinking water quality. Recent studies, sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies, of the Great Lakes, major rivers and other surface water systems are pointing toward climate change as a potential cause of the rising number of algae bloom problems.

ECD’s field-proven Triton EV82 Sensors measure chlorophyll, algae, phytoplankton, cyanobacteria and other plant matter. These sensors utilize state-of-the-art fluorescence sensing technology that detects chlorophyll levels and come in four unique optical configurations for water quality and environmental applications. Also available is Cyanobacteria Sensors for blue-green algae, which measures phycocyanin for freshwater cyanobacteria or phycoerythrin for marine water cyanobacteria. EV82 sensors are typically used to measure rising or falling trends of the desired measurement parameter chosen and then the sensor is pre-calibrated at the factory.

EV82 Toxic Algae Bloom Sensor

The EV82 Sensors incorporate ECD’s intelligent design, which features built-in digital serial communications. The measurement parameter’s calibration data is stored in the sensor allowing plug-and-play field installation of a pre-calibrated sensor. The EV82 sensors also directly connect to the ECD T80 Universal Transmitter, the ECD LQ800 Multi-Channel Controller or directly with any control system’s programmable logic controller (PLC) via the sensor’s built-in serial communication.

The minimum chlorophyll sensing ranges available are a choice of either 0.03 ug/L (blue excitation method) or 0.3 ug/L (red excitation method). The Model EV82’s rugged, submersible IP-68 rated standard sensor operates at depths of up to 33 feet (10 meters) for maximum flexibility, with greater depths available.

The Model EV82’s easy-to-install sensor features a rugged, secure mounting that is accomplished with the provided pipe thread for a permanent standpipe installation. No special tools or extensive training are required. The sensor operates over a wide temperature range from 32 to 122 °F (0 to 50 °C) for application versatility.

The T80 Transmitter and the LQ800 Multi-Channel Controller are also both simple to install for a full analyzer capability. They feature built-in power supplies that operate over 24 VDC power. Just plug them in and they’re ready to go. Outputs are via Modbus RTU RS485 digital communications, and they also include LCD displays with highly intuitive menus that will appeal to busy technicians.

Maintenance requirements are minimized by the Model EV82 Analyzer’s thoughtful sensor design, which features a smooth parallel optical sensing surface. This design reduces potential algae contamination without the need for extra cleaning maintenance by busy plant technicians. Ease of installation and low maintenance requirements reduce this analyzer’s total installed and lifecycle costs.

In vitro and in vivo anti-cancer effects of hibernating common carp (Cyprinus carpio) plasma on metastatic triple-negative breast cancer,"Preparation of the fish for hibernation

All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Isfahan (IR.UI.REC.1398.072). Alive adult common carps (mean weight: 1670 ± 240 g, mean length: 34.4 ± 7.9 cm) were purchased from a local fish farm in Isfahan provenance, Iran. They were placed in a 200-L plastic tank with circulating aerated water (Temperature: 20 °C, Flow rate: 500 L/h, Dissolved oxygen: > 5 mg/L) for one month. After acclimation period, the fish were randomly divided into two groups including non-hibernating and hibernating. Non-hibernating fish were kept in the same containers and conditions (Temperature: 20 °C). The hibernation protocol was done according to previous studies13,26,50. The fish were induced into a hibernated state by gradient cooling of water at the rate of 1–2 °C until 3 °C in water tanks located in a temperature-controlled cold room and maintained at this temperature during the winter. Then, we separately put the fish of each groups in a water tank containing eugenol (4-allyl-2 methoxy phenol, the active component of clove oil, 40 mg/L) to anesthetize them. Anesthesia of fish is characterized by the complete loss of balance, immobility, and failure to respond to strong external stimuli, such as intense touch and vibration of the tail area51. The fish were anesthetized by eugenol (40 mg/L) and blood was collected from the caudal vasculature. Subsequently, plasma was isolated, separately pooled together for each group, lyophilized and stored at -80° C for further use.

Cell culture

The murine triple-negative mammary cancer (4T1) and normal murine fibroblast (L929) cell lines were obtained from the Pasteur Institute (Tehran, Iran). 4T1 and L929 cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at standard cell culture condition (37 °C, 5% CO2).

MTT assay

The cell viability of 4T1 and L929 cells was evaluated using MTT (3-(4 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Briefly, cells were allowed to grow to 80% confluency. The cells were detached using 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution (GIBCO, USA) and seeded in 96-well culture plates at density of 5 × 103 cells/well. After 24 h incubation, different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 mg/ml) of lyophilized plasma of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp dissolved in culture medium were added to each wells. After 24, 48, and 72 h of cells seeding in 96 -well plate, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then media were replaced with a basal culture medium containing 0.005% MTT solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). After 4 h incubation (37 °C, 5% CO2) in the dark, the medium was discarded and the precipitated formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Finally, the absorbance of each well was detected by an Absorbance Microplate Reader (BioTek-ELX800, USA) at the wavelength of 570 nm. According to the following equation, the percentage of cell viability was calculated by relative value to the untreated cells (0 mg/ml) as the control group. The experiment was repeated three times and at least six wells were used for each concentration.

$$ Cell \,Viablity\, \left( \% \right) = \frac{{\left( {OD \,Sample - OD \,Blank} \right)}}{{\left( {OD \,Control - OD \,Blank} \right)}} \times {1}00 $$

Morphological assessment

4T1 and L929 cells were separately seeded in 6-well culture plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h. Then, the wells were washed three times with PBS (Sigma, USA). An inverted phase-contrast light microscope (Olympus, Japan) was used to capture photographs before treatment. Then, the wells were divided into three groups including control, hibernating plasma, and non-hibernating plasma. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group, while the cells of hibernating plasma group were treated with the optimal hibernating plasma concentration selected from the MTT assay (16 mg/ml). The same concentration of non-hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) was used to treat the cells of hibernating plasma group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. After 24 h, the wells were washed three times with PBS and microscopic photographs were captured to evaluate changes in cellular morphology.

Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining assay

The dual-fluorescent AO/EB staining assay was used to evaluate the cell viability as well as apoptosis. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with the optimal hibernating and non-hibernating plasma concentration (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. Then, the wells were washed three times with PBS and stained with 100 µl AO/EB mixture solution containing 100 µg/ml acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 100 µg/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in PBS for 30 min in the dark. Finally, an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan) was used to capture images.

Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) staining assay

Apoptosis rate was determined by the apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences, USA) according to previous study52. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a concentration of 1 × 105 and incubated overnight. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 16 mg/ml hibernating plasma or the same concentration of non-hibernating plasma for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. The cells were detached and washed three times with cold PBS (1X, pH 7.4) and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min. Then, the cells were resuspended in binding buffer (100 µl), stained with 5 µl of Annexin V-FITC and the same volume of PI, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Subsequently, the volume of each sample was increased to 500 μl by adding binding buffer and the cells were immediately analyzed (104 cells/sample) using flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, USA). This experiment was independently repeated three times and the obtained data were analyzed by the FlowJo-V10 software.

Cell cycle analysis

The Tali™ cell cycle kit (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, USA) was performed to determine the percentage of cells at each stage of the cell cycle. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 and incubated overnight. Subsequently, the cells were treated with hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) or non-hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. After that, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice with cold PBS. Then, they were fixed with dropwise addition of 70% ice-cold ethanol (1 ml) while gentle vortexing and stored at -20 °C overnight. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min. Then, the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of Tali™ cell cycle solution. Finally, it was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The DNA content of stained cells was analyzed using flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, USA) for each sample. This experiment was independently repeated three times and the results were displayed as histograms. The obtained data were analyzed by the FlowJo-V10 software.

Wound healing assay

The wound healing (or scratch) assay was carried out for cell migration analysis. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates and incubated for 48 h to grow to 80% confluency. Then, the cell layer was scratched by a sterile P200 Micropipette tip. The wells were washed twice with PBS to remove the debris and smoothing the edges of the scratch. Next, the cells were incubated with RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.5% FBS and treated with the optimal hibernating or non-hibernating plasma concentration (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. The photographs were obtained from the selected regions using an inverted phase-contrast light microscope (Olympus, Japan) at 0 h (immediately after media replacement) and 24 h after treatment with hibernating and non-hibernating plasma. The Wound Healing Size Tool, as an ImageJ/Fiji1 plugin, was used to quantifying the wound area53. The following equation was used to calculate the wound closure percentage.

$$ Wound\; closure\, \% = \left. {\left( {\frac{Initial\; wound\; area - Final\; wound\; area }{{Initail\; wound\; area}}} \right.} \right) \times 100 $$

Cancer cells implantation and tumor challenge

All animal experiments and procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Isfahan (IR.UI.REC.1398.072). A total of 54 female Balb/c mice (mean weight: 23 ± 2 g) were purchased from the Royan Institute of Isfahan, Iran. The mice were housed in standard cages with controlled temperature (24 ± 2 ºC), relative humidity (50 ± 10%), 12-h light–dark cycle, and ad libitum access to enough food and water. It should be mentioned that standardized humane endpoints based on the current guidelines for endpoints in animal tumor studies were used54,55,56. After two weeks of acclimation, the mice's belly hair was shaved and disinfected with 70% alcohol. 1.5 × 106 4T1 cells suspended in 50 µl of basal culture medium were subcutaneously injected into the fourth left mammary fat pad of each mouse. When the tumor size reached 50–70 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into three groups including control, hibernating plasma, and non-hibernating plasma. The control group of mice was intratumorally injected with PBS (200 µl), while the other groups were respectively treated with intratumoral (i.t) injection of hibernating plasma (200 µl, 16 mg/ml) and non-hibernating plasma (200 µl, 16 mg/ml) once every day for 18 days. For tumor growth analysis, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor volume was calculated using the following equation.

$$ Tumor\; volume = \frac{{\left( {Tumor\; length} \right) \times \left( {Tumor\; width} \right)^{2} }}{2} $$

The greatest longitudinal diameter (length) and the greatest transverse diameter (width) of tumors were measured by a digital caliper (Neiko, USA) every three days. Besides, the body weights of tumor-bearing mice were measured. For survival analysis, 24 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 8). The tumor-bearing mice were closely monitored for 60 days after tumor implantation. The animals’ death was recorded every day. The failure to eat and drink for over 3 days and a lack of limb movement were considered as the standardized humane endpoint used to euthanize animals by an overdose of ketamine/xylazine solution.

Metastasis analysis

Metastasis is the main cause of death for cancer patients57,58. For metastasis analysis, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor implantation and treatment approaches were as described in the previous section. The mice were sacrificed by overdose of ketamine/xylazine and their liver and lungs were harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution 40 days after cancer cell implantation. An automatic tissue processor (Sakura, Japan) was employed to process the fixed samples. Then, a microtome (Leica Biosystems, Germany) was utilized to cut 4 µm thickness serial sections from the paraffin-embedded blocks. The sections were stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining protocol for subsequent histological evaluation59. A minimum of 10 random microscopic fields was observed under the 10 × objective lens of a light microscope (Olympus, Japan) to report the mean number of metastatic colonies per microscopic field of the liver. Furthermore, the occupied area by metastatic colonies in each microscopic field of the liver (magnification × 100) was quantified by the Qupath software. The mean percentage of occupied space by liver metastatic colonies in each microscopic field was reported for each sample. Besides, all over the H&E stained sections of lungs were analyzed for counting metastatic colonies.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical staining of the proliferation marker Ki-67 was carried out to evaluate the anti-proliferative effect of hibernating plasma on 4T1 breast tumors. This biomarker is commonly used in the clinic for identifying the prognosis and effectiveness of treatment in patients60,61. For the analysis of Ki-67, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor implantation and treatment approaches were as described in the previous section. The mice were sacrificed with the overdose of ketamine/xylazine solution after 18 days and the tumors were harvested. After 24 h fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin, the specimens were processed by an automatic tissue processor (Sakura, Japan), followed by routine methods for subsequent histological evaluation. The sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti-Ki-67 antibody (Biolegend, USA) at 4 °C overnight. The sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG followed by incubation with streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (HRP). After three times wash, the sections were incubated with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) tetrahydrochloride and followed by a counterstain with hematoxylin62. The photographs of slides were taken by using a digital light microscope (Olympus, Japan), and the percentage of tumor cells that were positive for the Ki-67 as a proliferation biomarker was quantified using ImageJ software63.

Analysis of plasma proteins by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS)

Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate–Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out to analyze the plasma proteins of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp. Firstly, 1 mg of the lyophilized plasma of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp was separately dissolved in 1 ml PBS buffer. Protein concentration of the lyophilized plasma was determined using a microplate reader (BioTek-Synergy HT, USA). Then, 15 µl of dissolved lyophilized plasma was mixed with 5 µl of sample loadings buffer for SDS-PAGE (1X; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. After that, 20 µl of this solution was loaded into each well of the gel (12% SDS-PAGE). The gels were electrophoresed at 70 V for 30 min and then at 130 V for 1.5 h using a SDS gel running buffer. The molecular weight marker of the protein (ranging from 5–232 KDa) included Insulin (5 KDa), Ribonuclease A (13 KDa), Chymotrypsinogen A (25 KDa), Ovalbumin (43 KDa), Bovin Serum Albumin (67 KDa), Aldolase (158 KDa), Catalase (232 KDa) was loaded in a lane next to the plasma samples. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 45 min at 25 °C after electrophoresis. Hot water and a shaker (IKA-Werke, Germany) were used to decolorize the gel. Finally, the gels were imaged using a Bio-5000 Plus gel imaging scanner (Zhongjing Microtek, Shanghai, China), and the density of protein bands was measured by Image J Software. The 158 KDa band cut off from the gel and send for the high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS) analysis performed by Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC-Micromass Quattro micro API Mass Spectrometer.

Statistical analysis

The data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc tests were used to evaluate the significance of the difference between groups, by employing the JMP 14.0 software (SAS Institute, Japan). The difference was considered statistically significant if P < 0.05. (*: P < 0.05, ns: not significant). The Kaplan–Meier curves were drawn and analyzed by JMP software, using the Log-Rank test to assess the significant differences between the mean survival time of tumor-bearing mice in different groups.

Ethical approval

All animal experiments and procedures were conducted according to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the University of Isfahan, which refer to the American Association for Laboratory Animals Science and the guidelines laid down by the NIH (NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals) and also ARRIVE guidelines. All experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Isfahan, Iran (IR.UI.REC.1398.072).",,[],"['Golpich', 'Department Of Plant', 'Animal Biology', 'Faculty Of Biological Science', 'Technology', 'University Of Isfahan', 'Isfahan', 'Amini', 'Department Of Cell', 'Molecular Biology']"

Why This Blue Beer Has Major Health Benefits,"Unlike the green beer swilled by the masses on St. Patrick's Day, which uses green food dye, Line's bluish tint is caused by the pigment phycocyanin found in the blue-green algae known as spirulina, according to Food & Wine. Like its green counterpart, the blue color doesn't impact the beer's flavor in any discernible way. It is made in the style of a session IPA, producing notes of citrus and a slight hoppiness.

Since it contains spirulina, the beer provides a number of potential health benefits, and clocking in at a modest 3% ABV (Alcohol by Volume), you're unlikely to get inebriated if you indulge in one or two. This particular type of algae, which is available in dietary supplements, is packed with protein and rich in vitamins, according to Medical News Today. A series of studies published through the National Library of Medicine have indicated that spirulina also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help strengthen the immune system.

Blue-green algae is often labeled a superfood as well, although this is not a medical or scientific term and can sometimes be associated with product marketing hype. Regardless, spirulina is nutrient-dense and low in calories, so ""To your health"" just might prove a fitting toast for those raising a glass of this quirky blue beer.",,[],['Colin Mccandless']
Algenist Launches Blue Algae Vitamin C Skinclarity Brightening Serum,"The unique form of vitamin C is said to help visibly restore skin clarity and improve skin texture in 10 days.

Algenist has launched the Blue Algae Vitamin C Skinclarity Brightening Serum, featuring its Blue Algae Vitamin C, an L-ascorbic acid made from regenerative spirulina blue-green algae.

The unique form of vitamin C is said to help visibly restore skin clarity and improve skin texture in 10 days.

Skinclarity Brightening Serum is also formulated with Algenist's patented Alguronic Acid to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles; a marine ferment to help improve the appearance of skin texture and hydrate skin; a moisturizing complex that combines hyaluronic acid and Alguronic Acid to help provide a clinically measured increase in skin hydration; and tansy extract to help condition and soothe skin.

The vegan product is said to target the appearance of pigmentation, appearing most prominently in the fair and deep complexions as dark spots, uneven tone and texture, and overall dullness.

The serum retails for $72 at the brand's site and at Sephora.

Tammy Yaiser, VP product development, said: ""The team was inspired by the extensive research on blue-green algae, and for the potential to derive, extract and isolate its naturally-occurring vitamin C component and then to regeneratively produce it in a lab. The spirulina is sustainably grown, and the naturally-occurring vitamin C component is isolated and concentrated. The result is a highly pure ascorbic acid raw material, identified simply on the ingredient list as 'ascorbic acid.' What's also exciting about the process is that the leftover algae by-product is still rich in nutrients and can be beneficial for other applications such as fermentation, agricultural fertilizers and wastewater remediation. A part of the leftover biomass is used for making spirulina extract and spirulina oil. We considered the whole process.""

CEO Rose Fernandez, said: ""When we set out to solve a problem in 10 days with each of our formulas, the process is rigorous. If an ingredient or technology does not exist to help deliver on our promise of 10-day results, or if we see a way to re-envision traditional methods ingredients are made to elevate our commitment to high-performance, naturally-sourced and more sustainably-produced ingredients—we will make our own. This is how the brand was born and proudly continues today. Today we have consumers searching for vitamin C at high rates. This inspired us to develop a naturally-derived, potent vitamin C from a bold, blue spirulina. In our scientific study, our new Blue Algae Vitamin C outperformed other commonly used forms of vitamin C and other brightening ingredients specifically used for targeting pigmentation that we tested. No surprise given our reputation. This coupled with the fact that there was an opportunity to develop a new vitamin C serum actually clinically studied on melanin-rich skin—who can experience skin sensitivity, blotchiness or even products that simply don't work.""

I Tried Kourtney Kardashian’s Viral Breakfast and I’m Mad About How Good It Is,"This article originally appeared on Vegetarian Times

Now that Kourtney Kardashian has transitioned from famous-because-she's-rich person to professional wellness guru thanks to her website, Poosh, the 42-year-old's workout routines, beauty regime, and, recipes have become the subject of intense internet scrutiny. Perhaps none more so than the TikTok-viral avocado pudding.

After sharing a cup of the pale green pudding with Addison Rae in a YouTube video, the goop Kardashian claims she's eaten for breakfast every day for the past five years took off on its own trajectory - earning a mixed bag of fevered admiration and outright disgust. ""I wish everyone understood how good this is,"" Rae proclaimed, seemingly earnestly in the clip. But not everyone who tried the recipe had such a favorable opinion.

TikToker @myhealthydish said ""it tasted like baby food."" In another video, @eitan calls it ""mutant ninja jelly,"" and, in what is perhaps my favorite review, @tandisss says it looks and tastes like ""it came out of Shrek's asshole.""

The original recipe feels a bit extra (and not even entirely vegetarian). In addition to avocado, milk (any kind, but Kourt uses her homemade macadamia milk, of course), and sweetener, it calls for ingredients like MCT Oil, vanilla bone broth protein powder, and BrainOn (""a Refractance WindowTM dried, concentrated organic E3AFA (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) extract of Phycocyanin and Phenylethylamine (PEA)""), none of which I happened to have on hand. Fortunately, a simplified version, sans supplements, exists.

I was fully prepared to hate Kourt's avocado pudding-smoothie. I was already distraught about potentially wasting an avocado to try it, but try it I did, for you, reader, and what I discovered shocked me to my core.

Story continues

It's kind of...good? Kourtney Kardashian and Addison Rae were...right???

My first attempt was as close to the original as possible -- one avocado, one can of coconut milk, and a big spoonful of Makuna honey (Kourt's preferred variety). Straight out of the blender, I found it to be creamy, a little sweet, and actually quite pleasant. I could imagine how lovely it would be right after a grueling workout, if grueling workouts were my kind of thing.

But I didn't stop there. After watching 100 TikTok videos of people riffing on this recipe, I had a few hunches about potential enhancements. So, I put the blender pitcher back on its base and added a banana, a cup of ice cubes, and a big squeeze of lime juice, and the result was, hand to god, delicious. I was so surprised, I was almost mad.

Avocado desserts are nothing new, and you probably won't be surprised to learn that Kardashian did not, in fact, invent them. She credits her child Reign’s Brazilian nanny for introducing her to the idea, which she modified to fit her lifestyle. In Brazil, something similar to this known as Creme de Abacate, and as many TikTokers point out, there's also Sinh To Bo, a refreshing Vietnamese drink that combines avocado, ice, and condensed, sweetened milk.

Inspired by TikTok user @nicole_thenomad, I decided to further gild the lily, turning my avocado pudding concoction into a smoothie bowl situation, with mango, fresh berries, and homemade granola, and maybe this is a breakfast I'll eat again? Maybe even every day for five years, I'm not sure! I'm not sure about anything anymore...
