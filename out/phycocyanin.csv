phycocyanin,phycocyanin,Scientists unlocking secret of phycocyanin instability for vivid blues,"Phycocyanin is a food colourant that provides a vivid blue pigment. However, it has a drawback: it can prove unstable when used in formulations like soft drinks and sports beverages, losing its hues under fluorescent light on the grocery store shelf.

Scientists at Cornell University say they have found the reason for this unique behaviour ‘with the help of physics’ and the ‘bright X-ray beams’ from the University’s synchrotron.

“Phycocyanin has a vibrant blue colour,”​ said Alireza Abbaspourrad, assistant professor of food chemistry and ingredient technology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “However, if you want to put phycocyanin into acidified beverages, the blue colour fades quickly due to thermal treatment.”​

Now, they believe they have the opportunity to stabilise it, according to new research published in the American Chemical Society’s journal BioMacromolecules​.

The research, ‘Tuning C-Phycocyanin Photoactivity via pH-Mediated Assembly–Disassembly​’, was authored by Ying Li, a doctoral student in food science; Richard Gillilan, staff scientist at the Macromolecular X-ray science at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source; and Abbaspourrad.

Protein structure and colour stability

Most food companies seeking blues in their food use synthetic food dye, Abbaspourrad said.

Phycocyanin is derived from algae and as such it represents a natural and more nutritional protein that could help food and beverage manufacturers meet growing demand for clean label, natural products. The food scientists therefore set out to understand its colour properties and how it worked.

To achieve this, the researchers partnered with the Macromolecular Diffraction Facility of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) and used Size-Exclusion Chromatography coupled to Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SEC−SAXS) on a beamline.

Phycocyanin was placed into a biological fluid and brought to the MacCHESS laboratory. There, intense beamline X-rays were channelled into tiny drops of the fluid. The small-angle X-ray scattering showed that as pH levels, the molecular strands changed into different shapes, folds and assemblies.

“As pH changes, the phycocyanin molecules form in different ways. If the pH goes up, the molecules come together and if the pH level goes down, the molecules disassemble,”​ explained Li.

“As we changed the environmental stimulus for the phycocyanin, the molecules modulate their behaviour in terms of how they interact with light. It's a relationship of the protein structure and the colour stability.”​

The acidity of the environment can essentially mediate an assembly-disassembly pathway, Abbaspourrad said. “Through the X-ray scattering we could see the proteins and see how their monomers are assembled together and how the oligomers disassemble. That’s the root cause for how the blue colour fades,”​ he explained.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,Influence of Pholiota adiposa on gut microbiota and promote tumor cell apoptosis properties in H22 tumor-bearing mice,"The results of LC–MS analysis

As shown in Fig. 1, in the present study, under optimal chromatographic and MS conditions14,15, 3 compounds were identified by comparing the retention times and matching the empirical molecular formulas with those of known saponins; six phenolic compounds, seven fatty acid compounds, three nucleotide compounds, five quinone compounds, six carbohydrate compounds, and four steroid compounds were identified, and sterol compounds, such as ergosterol peroxide, ergosta-4, 6, 8(14)22-tetraen-3-one, ergosterol, and (22E,24R)-ergosta-7, 22-dien-3β,5α,6β-triol, accounted for a high proportion (Table 1).

Analyses of tumor weight, tumor inhibitory rate, and organ index

The tumor volume growth curves are shown in Fig. 2. The tumor growth rate in the model group was more than 2.6 cm3 on Day 15. In contrast, CTX-treated and all EPA-treated groups showed obvious inhibition of tumor growth.

The organ index, tumor weight, and tumor inhibitory rate (TIR) are shown in Table 2. The CTX-treated group exhibited the highest TIR (92.42%). Moreover, the tumor weight in the EPA-treated groups significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, with tumor inhibitory rates of 79.70%, 84.55%, and 87.28%. The spleen and thymus indices were significantly lower in the CTX-treated group than in the normal group, and the thymus was severely atrophic (p < 0.05). The EPA-treated groups showed significant improvements, and there was a protective effect on the spleen and thymus.

Analysis of the expression of serum cytokines and VEGF in mice

ELISA was used to investigate the effects of EPA on serum cytokine production, including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, AST, BUN, and IL-6, in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Angiogenesis has become an important therapeutic target for many tumors and is an essential process for tumor growth and metastasis10,16.

As shown in Fig. 3, compared with the levels in the normal and model groups, the serum levels of IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α significantly increased in the EPA-treated HD group (p < 0.05). VEGF levels were significantly decreased in the CTX-treated and EPA-treated groups. The AST and BUN levels in the model group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group (p < 0.05). The values of these two parameters significantly decreased in the EPA-treated groups compared to those in the model control group (p < 0.05). The AST levels of mice in the CTX-treated group were significantly higher than those of the model group (p < 0.05).

Morphological analysis after treatment with EPA

Histopathology was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the tumor. As shown in Fig. 4A, tumor cell in the model group s were plump and intact, with large nuclei. After treatment with EPA and CTX, the tumor cells exhibited a large necrotic region and were stained darker, which indicates that the significant antitumor efficacy of EPA in H22 tumor-bearing mice involved inducing cell death.

Figure 4 Histological examination of the morphological changes in tumors from H22-bearing mice. Tumor tissues stained with H&E (A) (400 ×) TUNEL assay (400 ×) (B,C). Full size image

The TUNEL assay results are shown in Fig. 4B,C, and cells with brown granules were considered positively stained10,17. The percentage of positive cells in the model group was 5%; therefore, the amount of tumor cell apoptosis was minimal. However, the CTX-treated group exhibited the highest percentage of positive cells (44%). The EPA-treated groups showed an increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, with values of 12%, 28%, and 42%. Moreover, the mice in the HD and EPA-treated group showed a positive cell percentage similar to that of the CTX-treated group.

Effects of EPA on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and VEGF

Based on the results of previous studies18, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the proapoptotic factor BAX, the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase 3 to determine the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, as shown in Fig. 5. BAX and cleaved caspase 3 expression intensities increased, while Bcl-2 expression decreased in the EPA-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the ratio of Bcl-2 to BAX decreased significantly. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level in the EPA-treated groups significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and VEGF expression was lowest in the CTX-treated group.

In addition, western blotting was used to analyze the expression of Bcl-2, BAX, cleaved caspase 3, and VEGF. As shown in Fig. 6, all EPA-treated groups showed increased BAX and cleaved caspase 3 protein expression and decreased Bcl-2 and VEGF protein expression; these results were consistent with the results of the immunohistochemical analysis. However, the expression of PI3K/AKT and p-AKT/AKT increased in a dose-dependent manner in the EPA-treated group.

Results of the rank-abundance curves of microorganisms in samples

The rank-abundance curve is a method used to analyze the diversity of microorganisms. In this study, the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) rank-abundance curves showed the diversity in the samples, which can be explained by species richness and evenness19. In the horizontal direction, the wider the span of the curve is, the richer the species rank of the microorganism sample20. The OTU rank-abundance curve in this study showed that the abundance distribution of the samples was even, as it was flat and smooth in the vertical direction (Fig. 7). The richness and evenness of the samples shown in the rank-abundance curve indicate that the diversity of the samples was rational and reasonable.

Dilution curves of microorganisms in the gut microbiota

The dilution curve was used to evaluate whether the sample sequencing depth was sufficient to cover all species of microbes and compare species richness among different sequenced samples. A flat curve indicates that the sequencing data are reasonable and reflect the structure of the entire community21. The number of sequences reached 5000, and the curves were in the plateau stage (Fig. 8). Therefore, the experimental data were deemed reasonable and reliable.

Species accumulation curves of the gut microbiota

The species accumulation curve is used to describe the increase in species with the increase in the number of samples and is an effective tool for investigating the composition and predicting the abundance of species in samples. This curve reflects whether the number of samples was sufficient. In this study, we mainly observed the end of the curve; if it showed a sharp upward trend, the number of samples was considered insufficient, while if the end of the curve tended to be flat, the number of samples was considered sufficient22. The end of the species accumulation curves of Specaccums tended to be flat in this study; therefore, the sampling was considered sufficient to carry out data analysis (Fig. 9).

Results of alpha diversity analysis of the gut microbiota

In this study, six indicators, including the Chao1 index, observed species index, PD_whole_tree index, goods-coverage index, Shannon index, and Simpson's index, were analyzed to assess the species diversity of individual samples (Fig. 10). There was no significant difference in flora abundance or diversity between the normal, model, and HD groups in the EPA-treated group.

Results of beta diversity analysis of the gut microbiota

Beta diversity analysis was used to compare the differences in species diversity among intergroup samples, and the evolutionary distance between species was considered while calculating the results. The higher the index value, the greater the difference between the samples. In this study, the UniFrac results were divided into two parts: the weighted UniFrac, which considered the abundance of the sequence, and the unweighted UniFrac, which did not consider the abundance of the sequence. According to the statistical analysis of the differences of the clustered samples, the similarity of species composition among the samples was determined by calculating the distance between the samples23.

ANOSIM similarity analysis was used to determine the intergroup and intragroup differences, and the grouping was found to be meaningful (Fig. 11). The R value of the unweighted results was R = 0.34 > 0 and p = 0.001 < 0.05, indicating that the differences between the groups were significantly greater than those within the group (intragroup). Therefore, the result is reasonable, and the data are statistically significant. Thus, in this study, the gut microbiota in tumor-bearing mice tended to be normal after EPA treatment.

Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was used to evaluate the differences between samples (Fig. 12)24. If the samples were in close proximity, the species compositions of the samples were similar. The EPA-treated group was closer in distance to the normal group, indicating that both groups had similar gut microbiotas.

Difference Analysis of the Gut Microbiota

To emphasize the statistical significance and biological relevance, the LEFse analysis of the gut microflora was performed, and the results are presented quantitatively in an LDA Score column and a cladogram. This study aimed to estimate the impact of the abundance of each component and identify the significant difference effect on the division of samples23. The results showed significant differences in the gut microflora, such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Streptococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Alistipes (Nor), Campylobacterales, Epsilonproteobacteria, Helicobacteraceae, Helicobacter, Escherichia_Shigella, Subdoligranulum (Mod), Prevotellaceae, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidaceae, Bacteroides, and Selenomonadales (EPA) (Figs. 13 and 14).

Species abundance in the gut microbiota

Histograms showing species profiling in the gut microflora of each sample were used to identify the species with higher relative abundances and individual samples at different classification levels (Fig. 15A and Table 3)25. In this study, the phylum level showed that Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Proteobacteria accounted for more than 98% of the total microflora after the different treatments. Compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes decreased, but Proteobacteria increased in the model group. In contrast, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes increased, but Proteobacteria decreased in the EPA-treated group and was close to that in the normal group. Thus, the trend in the two phyla in the microflora in the EPA-treated group trended more toward that in the normal group.

Table 3 The relative abundance of the main gut microbiota at the phylum level in four groups. Full size table

Figure 15B shows the genus level of the gut microflora in the three groups. Based on abundance, the main groups were Lactobacillus, Bacteroidales_S24 − 7_group_norank, Bacteroidales, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 001, Alloprevotella, Streptococcus, Alistipes, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 003, and Helicobacter. Based on the changing trend in the abundance of the gut microflora, it can be concluded that tumor-bearing mice that were treated with EPA tended to be closer to those in the normal control group. Compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of beneficial microflora such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroidales_S24 − 7_group_norank, Bacteroidales, Alloprevotella and Alistipes in the model group decreased by 6.95%, 25.25%, 4.67%, 2.65%, and 0.68%, respectively; accordingly, compared with those in the model group, those in the EPA group increased by 10.67%, 19.94%, 1.34%, and 3.29%, respectively, which showed a significant reversion in the reduction in beneficial microflora in the model group. In contrast, compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of the harmful microflora Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 001, Helicobacter, and Prevotellaceae_UCG − 003 in the model group increased to 16.39%, 7.01%, 5.83%, and 8.81%, respectively, while those in the EPA-treated group decreased to 17.99%, 1.44%, 5.81%, and 3.33%, respectively. These results showed that EPA treatment balanced the relative abundance of beneficial and detrimental bacteria in the gut microflora, as observed in the normal group.",,"['Wang', 'Academy Of Traditional Chinese Medicine', 'Jilin Agricultural Science', 'Technology University', 'Jilin', 'Academy Of Medical', 'Changchun Sci-Tech University', 'Changchun', 'Zhang', 'Liu']"
phycocyanin,phycocyanin,Taiyo wows at Vitafoods with special product prototypes,"Taiyo, the expert in health-promoting natural ingredients, introduced innovative concepts that generated great interest among visitors to Vitafoods Europe in Geneva.

The focus was on Taiyo's water-soluble ingredients such as Sunfiber, SunActive Mg and combination products like SunCurcumin. Additionally, Taiyo presented a blue Sunfiber, which consists of a combination with phycocyanin from the spirulina algae.

Other popular new products included power shot concepts based on prebiotic juice powders with Sunfiber, which were eagerly tasted by attendees, as well as prototypes of matcha pralines and Taiyo’s elderberry-based ElderMune gummies.

Taiyo presented more than 40 new product concepts at Vitafoods, based on seven different raw materials, including Guar bean fiber (PHGG), matcha, and elderberry. Highlights at the booth were its water-soluble ingredients – a range of Sunfiber blends with various additional health benefits, like blue Sunfiber: It consists of a combination from Sunfiber and the spirulina algae, which contains a lot of protein and is said to slow down ageing processes, and also strengthen the immune system .[1]​ Moringa Extract S, a standardised leaf powder with 10% glucomoringin, which has anti-inflammatory properties, also generated great interest. Whether presented as a capsule or tablet, visitors were excited by the variety of options available.

Another special offer at the Taiyo stand was vegan bolognese, made with Vegemeat, a granulated pea protein that is free from soy, gluten, additives and preservatives, and has a convincing, minced meat-like texture. It is particularly suitable for making dishes such as meat-free bolognese or lasagna and therfore appeals to the consumer group who follow a vegan or low-meat diet, or suffer from intolerances and therefore closely study ingredient lists. Thanks to the gentle manufacturing process, Vegemeat convinces with a low acrylamide value and is thus superior to many other legume-based meat alternatives.

Dr Stefan Siebrecht, Managing Director of Taiyo's German subsidiary, says: ""The trend towards organic products was really noticeable at the show. As consumers are increasingly questioning a product's ingredients and wanting natural and plant-based alternatives, manufacturers of end products are on the search for suitable solutions.""​

Another trend evident at Vitafoods was growing interest in functional confectionery. Delicious gummies with added health benefits, for example, are becoming increasingly popular among consumers. They can be easily adapted to the different needs of various consumer groups and are available as a healthy alternative to conventional fruit gums.

Taiyo has quickly responded to this trend and showcased its ElderMune gummies, which contain elderbery juice powder plus Sunfiber. These small berries positively impact immune health because they are rich in vitamins C and B, and contain essential oils and minerals. So-called anthocyanins – secondary plant substances – are not only responsible for the berry´s rich black-blue color but also protect the body's cells from free radicals. Heart and blood pressure also benefit from advantageous elderberries as they have anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects. They therefore provide a great alternative to cranberries in combating cystitis and kidney disease, and help thoroughly flush the excretory organs.[2]​

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,Start-up ‘beats the blues’ with spirulina-based food colouring for hot and cold beverages,"The colour blue is rare in nature, and as such, the pigment has been highly sought after – in textiles and paints alike – for millennia.

An ‘eye-catching’ and ‘exciting’ colour, blue has also proved an attractive hue for food and beverage makers. In the drinks category, well-known blue drinks range from blue lagoon cocktails to berry-flavoured soft drinks, blue lattes and functional sports beverages.

As the clean label trend continues apace, consumers are increasingly looking to avoid artificial synthetic colorants. But in the blue category, whether synthetic or natural, Israeli start-up Gavan says both face the same problem.

“Both synthetic blue dyes and plant-based blue colouring have regulatory, stability, intensity, or price challenges,” ​explained Yael Leader, head of product for Gavan.

“The main barrier to creating food formulations with natural colours is stability – the ability to overcome formulation challenges and ensure vibrant and consistent true blue throughout the product’s shelf life.” ​

While delivering a health-stable, naturally derived, vibrant blue for products with low pH is ‘tricky’, as any heat treatment or shift in pH can influence the colour’s shade, Gavan believes it has found the solution in spirulina.

Phycocyanin pigment-protein​

A type of blue-green algae, spirulina contains a pigment-protein known as phycocyanin, which produces a pure blue colour.

Gavan’s proprietary, non-GMO technology extracts phycocyanin and optomises the colourant ‘gently, without damaging the source, and enables the extraction of multiple compounds from the whole spirulina, without waste.

The result is a stable, blue colourant developed from technology that protects it from fading, event at pH as low as 3.0 or when pasteurised at 90°C for 30 seconds, noted the start-up.

“In addition, the platform’s control over particle size offers improved stability throughout the final product’s shelf life.” ​

Fortified drink potential​

Gavan says its platform allows for a ‘full spectrum’ of stable shades of blue, but as blue is a primary colour, it also ‘opens a window’ to producing other colours, from non-chlorophyll green to purple shades.

The start-up’s natural colouring formulation can be used for hot beverages, such as tea and coffee, as well as functional drinks and sports drinks.

“We have experienced quite a hearty demand from companies who are saying their consumers are looking for new experiences They have expressed a desire to widen their colour palates and are becoming more adventurous,” ​Itai Cohen, CEO and co-founder of Gavan, told FoodNavigator.

“This has spurred a growing demand for natural colours, whether blue or green, primarily for categories like functional beverages such as sports drinks and energy drinks and even cocktails.” ​

However, within the functional beverage category, when a large amount of vitamins and minerals can be added, ingredients can react with pigments and accelerate the colour degradation process.

This can cause fading, or create a complex binding of pigments and minerals that can deposit sedimentation in the final application, we were told.

Gavan’s platform provides a solution for the fortified beverages sector, amongst others.

From a clean label perspective, the colourant is marked as ‘spirulina extract’ on ingredients lists. “It complies with FDA-21 CFR US code of federal regulation code title 21,” ​said Cohen.

“The colouring principle complies with section 75.530 spirulina extract.” ​",,['Flora Southey']
phycocyanin,phycocyanin,A waste-to-wealth initiative exploiting the potential of Anabaena variabilis for designing an integrated biorefinery,"Characterization of aqua discharge, poultry litter, and cow dung

The study began with the characterization of wastewater, and solid wastes, where all the wastes analyzed viz., aqua discharge (AD), poultry litter (PL), and cow dung (CD) were found to be enriched with total organic carbon (TOC). AD also displayed a considerable presence of nitrate with a comparatively lower amount of nitrite, orthophosphate, and ammonium. In contrast, for the solid wastes (PL and CD), ammonium and orthophosphate were much more prevalent than nitrate and nitrite. Additionally, the lower dissolved oxygen (DO) and considerable chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biological oxygen demand (BOD) values of AD indicated the presence of organic load in the samples (Tables 1 and 2).

Biomass and total carbohydrate estimation of A. variabilis cultivated in AD medium compared to control BG-11 medium

Time-course studies were conducted to compare the biomass and total carbohydrate production of A. variabilis in control (BG-11 medium) and AD medium (Fig. 2). In this regard, the maximum biomass yield obtained using AD medium (0.45 g L−1) was fairly lower than that of the control (0.58 g L−1) (Fig. 2a). However, the total carbohydrate content displayed a ~ 20% higher value in the AD medium (58.0% dcw) compared to control (46.5% dcw) (Fig. 2b). This increased content obtained using the AD medium compensated for the reduced biomass yield, thus, not compromising with the volumetric production (mg L−1) of total carbohydrate. As a result, the total carbohydrate yield was comparable in both the cultivation media with respective values of 269.7 mg L−1 and 261.0 mg L−1 in control and AD medium (Fig. 2c). In contrast to control, where the maximum value for biomass and total carbohydrate was recorded on the 24th day, the incubation period was reduced to 21st day for cultures grown in the AD medium.

Biomass and total carbohydrate estimation of A. variabilis cultivated in different concentrations of PL and CD

Comparative analysis for biomass yield of A. variabilis cultivated in different concentrations of PL and CD are depicted in Fig. 3a–d, respectively. In order to have a better representation, two concentrations were considered at a time, each for PL and CD, and compared to the BG-11 control. An increasing trend was observed in the biomass production by augmenting the PL level up to 10 g L−1, whereas with CD extract, the maximum value was obtained at 15 g L−1 concentration, above which a declining pattern was observed. However, PL was found to stimulate the growth of A. variabilis more effectively than CD. The biomass yield attained its paramount value (0.90 g L−1) in the PL concentration of 10 g L−1 compared to 0.58 g L−1 in control (BG-11 medium), representing a 35.5% rise (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the biomass yield reached a maximum of 0.84 g L−1 using the CD concentration of 15 g L−1, demonstrating a 30.9% higher value than the control (Fig. 3d). For all the studied concentrations, A. variabilis displayed the peak value on day 24 of its incubation.

Figure 3 Time-course analysis of biomass yield (g L−1) of A. variabilis cultivated in different concentrations of PL: (a) 5 g L−1, 10 g L−1 (b) 15 g L−1, 20 g L−1 and CD: (c) 5 g L−1, 10 g L−1 (d) 15 g L−1, 20 g L−1 compared to control BG-11 medium. Full size image

Similarly, PL concentration of 10 g L−1 also resulted in the highest total carbohydrate content of 57.4% dcw with respect to 46.4% dcw obtained in the control BG-11 medium. Consequently, its yield was boosted to 516.6 mg L−1, representing a 47.9% higher value than the control (269.1 mg L−1) (Table 3). In contrast, for CD, the maximum total carbohydrate content of 52.3% dcw was recorded using 15 g L−1 concentration. At this concentration, the total carbohydrate yield reached 439.3 mg L−1, showing a 38.7% rise compared to control (Table 3).

Studies with combination of wastewater with solid wastes

Biomass and total carbohydrate estimation of A. variabilis cultivated in wastewater supplemented with different concentrations of PL and CD

The individual studies with solid wastes conducted so far involved cultivating the test cyanobacterium in PL and CD extract prepared with millipore water. To further economize the process, subsequent analyses were made in a medium prepared by supplementing these solid wastes in wastewater (AD). AD supplemented with 7.5 g L−1 PL was found to be the most suitable combination resulting in the highest biomass yield of 0.85 g L−1. Augmenting the level of PL in the AD medium to 10 g L−1 marked its de-escalation to 0.77 g L−1 (Table 4). For CD supplemented conditions, the combination of AD with 10 g L−1 CD was best amongst all, resulting in biomass produce of 0.78 g L−1 (Table 4). However, PL supplementation once again had a more dominating effect on A. variabilis, generating higher biomass yield at a comparatively lower concentration (7.5 g L−1). The biomass yield using the said combination (AD + 7.5 g L−1 PL) represented a 31.8% rise compared to the BG-11 control, which was also 47.1% higher than the un-supplemented AD medium.

Table 4 Maximum biomass and total carbohydrate production of A. variabilis in AD supplemented with different concentrations of PL and CD, compared to control (BG-11) and un-supplemented AD. Full size table

The carbohydrate production of the test cyanobacterium was also found to be maximum in AD supplemented with 7.5 g L−1 PL. The total carbohydrate content of 58.4% dcw and yield of 496.4 mg L−1 obtained using this combination was again highest in comparison to all the other PL supplemented conditions (Table 4). These values were also higher than the CD supplemented AD medium, where the maximum total carbohydrate content (53.4% dcw) and yield (416.5 mg L−1) were obtained at a concentration of 10 g L−1 (Table 4). Hence, using AD in combination with 7.5 g L−1 PL, a respective rise of 20.5% and 45.8% in total carbohydrate content and yield was recorded with respect to the control BG-11 medium. Although, compared to the un-supplemented AD medium, the cellular carbohydrate content did not show much variation, the rise in its volumetric yield was by 47.6%. Therefore, for the economical production of large volume bioethanol, the combination of AD with 7.5 g L−1 PL was chosen for further study. This medium was termed as ‘APL.’

Characterization of APL medium

The obtained APL medium was also characterized for the presence of orthophosphate, ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite, TOC, DO, COD, BOD and pH which are depicted in Table 5.

Table 5 Characteristics of APL medium. Full size table

Bioremediation efficiency of A. variabilis grown in APL medium

Inoculation of the APL medium with A. variabilis revealed 100% removal of orthophosphate within 30 days; and nitrate and nitrite within 20 and 15 days of incubation, respectively. While the concentration of ammonium was reduced to 19.2 mg L−1 from an initial value of 74.2 mg L−1, TOC content showed a drop from 91.3 mg L−1 to 17.8 mg L−1 in 35 days of incubation. In other words, cultivation of the test cyanobacterium in the APL medium brought about a respective 74.1% and 80.5% depletion in its ammonium and TOC concentration. COD and BOD were also reduced to 16.6 mg L−1 and 7.3 mg L−1 at the end of 35 days compared to 161.3 mg L−1 and 73.2 mg L−1, respectively, on day zero. Concurrently, an increase in the DO up to 6.8 mg L−1 was observed after the completion of 35 days of incubation (from 4.1 mg L−1 noted initially). The maximum pH of 7.3 was recorded on the 25th day of incubation (Table 6).

Individual production of bioethanol and co-products from A. variabilis grown in APL medium

As already observed in Table 4, AD + 7.5 g L−1 PL induced the maximum carbohydrate accumulation in A. variabilis. The carbohydrate obtained from the test cyanobacterium grown in APL medium was also predominated by higher yields of fermentable components such as reducing sugar and glycogen (Supplementary Figure S1). Consequently, an elevated volumetric production of bioethanol was obtained using the APL medium. Compared to 118.4 mg L−1 in BG-11 control, the bioethanol yield obtained from APL-grown A. variabilis showed a rise to 219.9 mg L−1, signifying a 46.2% higher value. Nevertheless, for both the conditions (control and APL), the bioethanol conversion % was found to range between 44 and 44.3% (Table 7).

Table 7 Bioethanol production in control (BG-11) and APL medium along with the conversion efficiencies. Full size table

APL medium also served effectively for significant accumulation of all the co-products (Table 8). Using this medium, C-PC content was increased to 5.4% dcw from 3.0% dcw in BG-11 control. On the other hand, PHB and SCC contents were respectively enhanced to 8.3% and 0.07% dcw in the APL medium compared to 6.1% and 0.04% dcw in control. A marginal increase was also witnessed in the EPS content from 39.2% (control) to 43.6% dcw (APL medium). This upsurge in the cellular concentration of the co-products alongside the augmented biomass yield of A. variabilis in the APL medium also heightened their volumetric production. A ~ 61–62% increase was noted for SCC and C-PC yield, recording respective values of 0.59 mg L−1 and 45.9 mg L−1 in the APL medium compared to 0.23 mg L−1 and 17.4 mg L−1 in BG-11 control. Likewise, the yield of PHB and EPS were also elevated to 70.6 mg L−1 and 370.6 mg L−1 from 35.4 mg L−1 and 227.4 mg L−1 in control, indicating a respective ~ 50% and ~ 39% rise (Table 8).

Bioethanol and the co-products harnessed from A. variabilis and their validation using different confirmatory analyses have been summarized in Fig. 4, the comprehensive illustration of which has been provided in Supplementary Figures S2–S7.

Figure 4 Production and confirmatory analyses of (a) Bioethanol, (b) C-PC, (c) PHB, (d) SCC, and (e) EPS from A. variabilis. Full size image

Bioethanol was obtained after fermentation of the pretreated hydrolysate and harvested by phase separation (Fig. 4a) using Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP). The bioethanol production was confirmed using GC–MS analysis, where its presence was detected at the retention time of 1.68 min (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figure S2), referring to the NIST mass spectral library.

C-phycocyanin (C-PC) was extracted as water-soluble blue color pigment and stored as freeze-dried powder (Fig. 4b). The confirmatory detection of C-PC was based on the spectrophotometric determination of the distinct peak at 620 nm, the absorption maxima of C-PC (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Figure S3).

Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) was extracted as white polymer, and its accumulation in A. variabilis was detected using GC analysis (Fig. 4c). The polymer sample obtained from the test cyanobacterium conformed to the standard PHB exhibiting the specific peak at the retention time of 4.5 min, hence, confirming PHB synthesis by A. variabilis (Supplementary Figure S4).

Chlorophyll extracted from A. variabilis was converted into its water-soluble derivative- sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC), which appeared as blue-black powder (Fig. 4d). The identification of SCC was performed using two confirmatory tests (copper test and flame test) to validate the presence of copper in it. In copper test, the formation of a brown-colored complex of copper diethyldithiocarbamate after addition of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate confirmed the presence of copper in the produced SCC sample. In flame test, the SSC sample solution burnt with a green-colored flame, hence, reconfirming the presence of copper in it (Fig. 4d). Additionally, the absorption spectrum of the produced SCC sample was also found to be similar to the standard SCC, showing peaks at the wavelengths of 405 nm and 635 nm (Supplementary Figure S5). This analogy in absorbance behavior again validated the SCC formation in the present study.

Exopolysaccharides (EPS) extracted from the test cyanobacterium when freeze-dried appeared as white cottony fiber (Fig. 4e). HPLC analysis revealed the obtained EPS to be constituted of pentoses like ribose and xylose; and hexoses, such as mannose, glucose, and galactose (Supplementary Figure S6), demonstrating the characteristic feature of cyanobacterial EPS29. The identification of these constituent sugars was performed by comparing their elution time with that of the standards (Supplementary Figure S7a–e).

Cyanobacterial refinery

After having established the suitability of APL medium in stimulating the individual yields of bioethanol and the co-products, it was applied to sequentially extract all the cyanobacterial products from the same harvested biomass. However, the major hindrance faced while executing a step-wise production is the intervention of solvents and extraction processes employed for a particular product on the yield of the others that are to be extracted subsequently. Therefore, in this study, six different sequences were analyzed to screen out the best amongst them that would ensure minimum yield losses (Table 9).

Table 9 Variation in the yield of different products from A. variabilis (equivalent to 1 kg dry biomass) grown in APL medium when placed in different sequential extraction positions. Full size table

Here, the amount of the harnessed products was calculated considering 1 kg dry (≈10 kg wet) biomass of A. variabilis grown in the APL medium. Hence, it becomes mandatory first to mention the yields of each product obtained individually from 1 kg of dry biomass without implementing the sequential extraction strategy. The individual EPS yield was 436.0 g, constituted by 224.5 g RPS and 211.5 g CPS, while the yields for SCC, C-PC, PHB, and carbohydrate were 0.69 g, 54.0 g, 83.1 g, and 584.0 g, respectively. Comparison of all the studied sequences (Table 9) revealed sequence 3 to result in minimum yield loss of all the co-products, comparable to their individual yields. Using this sequence, EPS yield of 430.1 g (222.7 g RPS + 207.4 g CPS), SCC yield of 0.66 g, C-PC yield of 52.9 g, and PHB yield of 79.4 g was obtained. However, compared to individual yield, carbohydrate was compromised in all the sequences, with sequence 3 generating a yield of 369.7 g. This was possibly owing to the prior extraction of CPS (capsular polysaccharides), which accounts for a significant portion of the cell’s total carbohydrate. As a consequence, the anticipated bioethanol yield was likely to be hampered, which is the primary product of the study. Therefore, the carbohydrate and bioethanol production from A. variabilis was also checked under the selected sequence 3 by eliminating the CPS extraction step. Removing this step resulted in notably higher bioethanol production (324.9 mL) comparable to the individual yield obtained from 1 kg dry biomass (329.5 mL). With respect to the sequence integrating CPS extraction, the bioethanol yield using the modified protocol (without CPS) also indicated a 35% rise (Supplementary Table S1). As a whole, using this designed refinery approach, ~ 61% of the cyanobacterial biomass could be effectively utilized for the production of bioethanol and various industrially vital products. The detailed design for the cyanobacterial refinery using the selected sequence has been schematically illustrated in Fig. 5.

Techno-economic assessment

One of the critical factors that confine the practical implication of a biorefinery is its economic feasibility under large-scale. Hence an idea regarding the techno-economic aspect is vital to apprehend the success of the developed strategy when upgraded to a large-scale scenario. Considering the direct costs involved in a biomass-based biorefinery, huge expenses are incurred in the growth medium of the test species that serve as the raw material for biomass production31. Nonetheless, in our current approach, the cyanobacterial species exploits waste-utilized APL medium for its growth, thereby completely nullifying the cost of the cultivation medium. The efficient nutrient removal ability of A. variabilis further alleviates the expenditure on additional waste remediation infrastructures32. Moreover, since the wastes (for formulating APL medium) were collected from the close vicinity of the experimental site, the transportation charges can also be considered negligible.

However, the harvesting process of the cyanobacterial biomass is a major cost-incurring step that can hinder large-scale biomass production. Hence, proper choice of harvesting methodology is crucial while aiming for biomass harvest under a scaled-up system. Among the different techniques, pH-induced flocculation using NaOH has been reported as the most economical and eco-friendly harvesting method for large-scale set-ups33,34. Assuming a scaled-up cultivation system of 10,000 L employing the APL medium, the harvest cost is estimated to be 0.765 $. This assessment relies on the published investigation of Koley et al.33, demonstrating the requirement of ~ 62 g NaOH/kg of harvested biomass alongside power consumption of 0.2 kW h/kg for culture agitation under field-level analysis.

Implementing the cyanobacterial refinery would also take into account the investments on the solvents and chemicals for extraction of the products. Following the sequential biorefinery protocol designed in this study, the cost of these extractants per Kg biomass reaches 7420.8 US$ (Table 10). It is worth mentioning here that the expenditure on pre-treatment, fermentation, and separation of bioethanol involving the use of sulfuric acid, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), YPD (yeast extract peptone dextrose) medium, and tributyl phosphate (TBP)26 would also contribute to the overall cost (Table 10).

Table 10 Cost estimation of chemicals and solvents required for harnessing the cyanobacterial products using the sequential biorefinery design, utilizing APL medium. Full size table

Hence, from the above table, the estimated cost of extractants required for the scaled-up biorefinery (10,000 L culture volume) can be evaluated as 63,102 US$. Additionally, the refinery protocol also involves oven drying of the cyanobacterial biomass (Fig. 5). With electricity requirement of ~ 6.32 kWh for obtaining 1 kg dry biomass26,35, the cost for drying the biomass harvested from 10,000 L culture approximates to 7.52 US$.

Despite these outlays, the large-scale execution of the proposed biorefinery looks plausible in view of the high commercial value of the harnessed cyanobacterial products. The projected earnings from commercializing all the cyanobacterial products (EPS, SCC, C-PC, PHB, and bioethanol) obtained under a scaled-up scenario of the present approach corresponds to ~ 7.2 million US$. This estimation has been carried out considering the market price of each product23,26. However, the total production cost would also include the cost of the cultivation set-up. Closed systems like a tubular photobioreactor (PBR) have been reported to account for up to 83% of the capital cost36. Besides, such mass-cultivation operations have to meet with general overhead charges related to cleaning, maintenance, and administration of the plant31. Though open-pond systems are known to procure lesser investments, PBRs ensure higher productivity accompanied by low downstream processing charges23,37. Hence, keeping aside some days for cleaning and maintenance of the system, running multiple cycles of cultivation per year would definitely increase the profit margin. This would, in turn, recompense the cost of initial investments on large-scale projects, helping to overcome the real-time challenges faced while establishing a successful biorefinery.

Environmental sustainability assessment

Environmental sustainability is another significant area to be addressed while assessing the aptness of a developed strategy. One way to conduct this assessment is through the evaluation of impact indicators such as cumulative primary energy (CPE) and global warming potential (GWP)38. Using the LCA (Life Cycle Analysis) methodology with these impact indicators, all the inputs and outputs of a system are taken into account. The output constitutes both quantitative and qualitative products generated, alongside the waste discharges in the environment, including emissions. On the other hand, the inputs encompass all the primary raw materials involved in each step of the production process. Fossil fuel for electricity generation, feedstocks for fertilizers production, energy requirement for extraction, processing, and transportation of the primary growth nutrients of the dedicated crop, etc., all fall under this category39. Therefore, determining the energy efficiency of a system is imperative for evaluating its ecological impact. In this direction, EROI (Energy Return on Investment) is a potential measure to check the energy balance of a particular process/product/system, which can be calculated using the following equation40:

$$EROI = \frac{Product\;energy\,output}{{Primary\;energy\;input\,(CED)}}$$

where ‘Product energy output’ indicates the energetic biomass fraction from which the final energy output (microalgal/cyanobacterial product) has been generated, and ‘CED’ stands for cumulative energy demand.

The above elucidation has been made in the context of third-generation feedstocks (microalgae/cyanobacteria), where a significant contribution to CED arises from the demand for nitrogen and phosphorus, the principal nutrients for their growth41. The value of the EROI should be > 1 to reflect a net positive energy balance41. This can be achieved by adopting strategies to lower the CED, which would, in turn, increase the EROI. Hence utilization of the nutrient-laden APL medium formulated out of wastes is expected to boost the overall EROI value by abating the nutrient supply in the cultivation phase. The carbon richness of the APL medium (Table 5) would also lessen the energy burden by rendering additional CO 2 sparging inessential. Use of the flocculation method for biomass harvest can further reduce the energy consumption involved in the centrifugation step, upsurging the net EROI42.

There always exists a relationship between the energy inputs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Global warming potential (GWP) (expressed as CO 2 equivalents) serves as an important tool for environmental sustainability measurement of a particular process/product. Unfortunately, most present-day biofuel production using conventional crops contributes minimally to GHG mitigation. Cultivation of the terrestrial crops demands clearance of grasslands and forests, which results in the loss of ongoing carbon dioxide capture43. The soil organic matter is also broken down, accelerating the release of carbon from the soil44. Besides, N 2 O emissions from the field applications of fertilizers and pesticides are the foremost contributor to GHG, with GWP > CO 2 by 298 times45. Contrarily, cyanobacteria/algae-derived biofuels have been specified to reduce GHG releases, particularly lowering the emissions from changes in the land-use practices43. The use of fertilizers and pesticides is also prevented46, reducing the N 2 O release. However, the emissions from fossil-fuel-driven energy production cannot be disregarded, as electricity requirement remains indispensable for various operational stages of the production process. The GWP per kWh will depend upon the electricity mix of a particular region47. Nonetheless, from the LCA perspective, an integrated production system with quantitative coproduct generation is known to lessen the extent of ecological impact48. This again points toward the large-scale applicability of the APL mediated biorefinery design, as it induced a remarkable rise in the yield of all the cyanobacterial products. Moreover, using cyanobacterial cultivation as a means of nutrient removal avoids the energy investment on separate wastewater treatment procedures, also withdrawing the release of the related emissions.

Cyanobacterial cultivation can suffer a major setback, specifically in areas where freshwater is limited. Hence, utilization of wastewater medium can also be a boon in lessening the freshwater inputs for the cultivation process. Taking ‘Water Footprints (WF)’ as an indicator of water-use extent, application of wastewater instead of freshwater would reduce the blue WF. Furthermore, the biologically treated wastewater can be recycled and reused. This would also help lower the grey WF by abating the chances of freshwater pollution23. A comprehensive take on the sustainability analysis of a multiproduct cyanobacterial biorefinery study would still mandate the complete LCA of each product. This would involve the evaluation of all the input and output parameters for every step right from cultivation, harvest, downstream processing, product generation, use, and disposal. A detailed analysis in this direction will be an essential domain to follow up in the offing.

Nonetheless, herein we try to portray the scope of the present biorefinery design by an ‘onion model’ consisting of distinct layers (Fig. 6). This holistic interpretation gives a clear idea regarding the different levels involved in the process implementation, indicating the specific purpose of each level. It is to be noted that the onion model depicted here has been constructed in view of the futuristic prospects of the present biorefinery design when scaled up to a photobioreactor (PBR) system. The positive scopes of cultivating A. variabilis in a PBR set-up have been discussed in our previous paper23.",,"['Deb', 'Agricultural', 'Food Engineering Department', 'Indian Institute Of Technology Kharagpur', 'Kharagpur', 'Mallick', 'Bhadoria', 'P.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,The best vegan sources of protein to include in your diet,"If you’ve just decided to go vegan, you’re probably wondering where to find the best vegan sources of protein. No wonder – for most people, switching to a plant-based lifestyle means completely overhauling their dietary habits. Without meat, dairy and eggs, many people may struggle to structure their diet in a way that helps them to meet their protein requirements.

So do you need to eat meat to get protein? In short, no – but it does require more planning and preparation. This is because protein is present in many different plants, but the quality may not always be comparable to that found in animal-based foods. Meat, dairy and eggs contain enough of all the essential amino acids – the building blocks of protein molecules that we are unable to produce ourselves. Most vegan sources of protein tend to lack one or more of these important components.

Of course, investing in the best vegan protein powder is one way to ensure you’re getting a full amino acid profile. Another option is to include more complete, or almost complete, plant-based protein sources in your diet. Here are eight of the best vegan sources of protein to help you meet your requirements while enjoying a plant-based lifestyle.

Also, check our 7-day plant-based diet meal plan for more ideas how to cook without animal-based foods!

1. Tofu and tempeh

Soy and soy-based products, such as tofu and tempeh, are one of the most common staples in plant-based kitchens around the world. Not only do they work well with a variety of dishes, they’re easy to prepare and a rich source of complete protein. What’s more, soybean products contain many important nutrients.

According to a review published in Nutrients (opens in new tab), tofu and tempeh are excellent sources of calcium , manganese and selenium , as well as highly bioactive compounds called isoflavones. Isoflavones are polyphenols that may mimic the effects of female reproductive hormones. Despite concerns that these compounds may negatively affect men’s health, available evidence (opens in new tab) suggests this is not the case. In fact, quite the opposite – multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that a high intake of soy and soy products may lead to a vastly reduced risk of dying from breast, gastric, colorectal, prostate and lung cancers, as well as cardiovascular diseases. Many of these effects have been attributed to isoflavones.

According to a review published in Molecules (opens in new tab), these polyphenols also have the potential to reduce blood pressure, regulate blood sugar levels, lower cholesterol levels and combat inflammation.

Add tofu and tempeh to salads, stir fries and one pot dishes. Also, use instead of meat alternatives, beans, peas and lentils.

Protein:

3 oz (85g) serving of tofu contains 8g of protein

2. Seitan

Seitan is a plant-based meat substitute made out of wheat gluten and as such, it’s often referred to as ‘wheat meat’ or ‘wheat gluten’.

Unlike similar soy-based products, it closely resembles the look and texture of cooked animal flesh. Apart from its distinctive chicken-like flavor, seitan is famous for its exceptionally high protein content.

However, despite being one of the richest vegan sources of protein available on the market, it’s worth mentioning that seitan is relatively low in the essential amino acid lysine, unless the wheat used for its production was fortified with this ingredient.

When it comes to nutritional value, seitan is low in fats and carbohydrates, and fairly high in selenium, iron , calcium, and phosphorus . It’s a great addition to any plant-based diet, but owing to its high gluten content, seitan can't be eaten by individuals suffering from celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.

Seitan is a great alternative to cooked meat. It can be pan-fried, sautéed or grilled, and added to soups, salads and stews.

Protein:

3 oz (85g) of seitan contains 64g of protein

3. Quinoa

Quinoa (pronounced keen-waa) is a highly versatile and easy to prepare pseudo grain from South America, and has a mild, nutty flavor that easily complements many dishes. This grain is particularly valued by people suffering from celiac disease as it doesn’t contain gluten.

Whilst a cup of cooked quinoa provides less than 10g of protein (slightly lower than other plant-based proteins) it is a popular food staple among vegans and vegetarians because it boasts a complete amino acid profile. It also has a particularly high lysine content.

But that’s not the only health benefit associated with this plant. According to a review published in the Molecules (opens in new tab) journal, quinoa is a rich source of biologically active compounds that have strong antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. What’s more, multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that regular consumption of quinoa provides protection against multiple different cardiovascular, metabolic, and degenerative diseases. It may also have a beneficial effect on the functioning of the immune system and menopause symptoms.

Quinoa works well for quick, one pan recipes or as an alternative to rice, pasta or porridge.

Protein:

One cup of cooked quinoa contains approximately 8g of protein

4. Buckwheat

Buckwheat is another gluten-free pseudo-cereal that provides good quality protein. Similar to quinoa, it contains a significant amount of the essential amino acid lysine. It’s also a great source of phosphorus, manganese, copper, magnesium and iron, as well as containing a wide array of biologically active compounds like flavonoids and beta-glucans.

What’s more, multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that regular consumption of buckwheat grain can help to regulate cholesterol levels, combat systemic inflammation and lower blood pressure, as well as reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease and several different types of cancer.

The most common way to eat buckwheat is in the form of soba noodles. These grains can also be cooked similarly to oatmeal, or ground into a flour and used in baking, particularly for pancakes and other breakfast dishes.

Protein:

One cup (168g) of cooked buckwheat oats provides approximately 6g of protein

5. Chia seeds

Chia seeds first rose to prominence as a unique cooking aid. The dietary fibers in chia seeds are able to rapidly soak up water and create a jelly-like texture, making them a great ingredient in baked goods, puddings and desserts.

First and foremost, however, they’re an excellent vegan source of protein, providing a significant amount of all essential amino acids. Chia seeds also contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary fibers, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus and potassium.

Owing to their great nutritional value, chia seeds may be highly beneficial for our health. According to a review published in Molecules (opens in new tab), regular consumption of chia seeds can reduce the risk of developing neurodegenerative and liver diseases, as well as hypertension, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular problems. Multiple studies have also shown that they can help with losing weight, reducing waist circumference and improving endurance in long-distance runners.

Chia seeds can be used to make puddings, desserts and pectin-free jams. They’re also commonly used as an egg substitute in vegan baking, and work well as a topping for oatmeal, salads or smoothies.

6. Hemp seeds

Hemp seeds are the small, edible fruits of the Cannabis sativa plant. If that raises your eyebrows, don’t worry – hemp seeds only contain traces of THC , the psychoactive ingredient that this recreational drug is known for. According to a review published in Nutrients (opens in new tab), the amount of THC in hemp-based foods is below the threshold of 0.3%, making it suitable for consumption.

There are definitely benefits to including more hemp seeds in your diet. These little pips not only have a pleasant, nutty taste and work well with a range of different dishes, they’re also very nutritious. Hemp seeds provide a whooping 32g of protein per 100g. They’re also rich in antioxidants and polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid (omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid ( omega-3 ), as well as iron, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and zinc. According to a review published in the Cancers (opens in new tab) journal, due to their strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, cannabinoids in hemp seeds can suppress and prevent tumor cells from developing and spreading further in the body.

Hemp seeds can be sprinkled over yogurts or salads, added to smoothies, or included in homemade granola and energy bars.

Protein:

7. Spirulina algae

The last few years have seen a steep rise in studies exploring the nutritional value and health benefits associated with marine algae. According to a review published in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture (opens in new tab), spirulina is one of the richest complete protein sources of microbial origin, almost on par with meat and soybeans. It also delivers a significant amount of B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, copper and iron, as well as multiple bioactive compounds, including phenolics, phycocyanins, and polysaccharides.

Multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that spirulina algae exhibits strong antioxidant, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, and may play an active role in preventing heart disease, hypertension, degenerative conditions, exercise-induced muscle damage and infectious diseases.

There’s even some emerging evidence (opens in new tab) that these algae can reduce mental fatigue, protect the brain vessels from damage and contribute to cognitive function.

Spirulina is mostly sold in the form of a powder with a characteristic green hue. This can be added to smoothies, granola bars, soups and salads. It can also be purchased as tablets.

Protein:

8. Beans, peas and lentils

Pulses (beans, peas and lentils) are not considered complete protein sources as they tend to contain fairly small amounts of two important essential amino acids – methionine and cysteine. However, since pulses are otherwise rich protein sources and deliver the bulk of this macronutrient in most plant-based diets, they deserve a mention.

According to a review published in the Journal of Medicinal Food (opens in new tab), pulses provide a hefty dose of dietary fiber , iron, zinc, folate, calcium and magnesium, as well as a wide range of phytochemicals with strong antioxidant and antimutagenic properties. Due to their low glycemic index, they may also help you to lose weight and keep your blood sugar under control.

Beans and lentils play an important role in regulating blood pressure, blood lipid profile and blood glucose metabolism, as well as reducing systemic inflammation and protecting against cardiovascular diseases. Although, some sensitive individuals may find pulses hard to digest.

Cooked pulses work great with most salads, soups and plant-based main meals, particularly stews and curries.

Protein:

A cup (200g) of boiled pulses provides anywhere from 15g (kidney beans, lentils and black beans) up to 39g (edamame beans and chickpeas) of protein",,['Anna Gora']

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,French Brewer Uses Algae to Make Blue Beer,"A French beer-making business, or brewery, is using a special kind of bacteria to turn their beer blue.

The beer, sold under the name Line, is an alcoholic drink made by the Hoppy Urban Brew brewery. The brewery was looking for a way to make its drinks different from other kinds of beer. So, the beer maker partnered with Etika Spirulina. It is a business in northern France that wants to popularize its spirulina algae as a dietary aid.

Sebastien Verbeke works at Hoppy Urban Brew. He told Reuters that the beer is selling well. ""It's getting an enormous amount of interest and curiosity on the part of the public,"" he said.

The part of the spirulina that gives the beer its blue color is called phycocyanin. It is added to the beer during the beer-making process.

Brewery worker Mathilde Vanmansart described the taste of the beer as hoppy, light, and a little fruity. She added that the only evidence of the added algae was the blue color.

Xavier Delannoy owns the farm that provides the spirulina. He said after several tests, the brewery had found a mixture that pleased buyers.

He said 1,500 bottles of the blue beer were sold between October and December last year. The brewery is now preparing to increase its production to meet demand.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,Could Spirulina be the next super-nutraceutical to be widely grown in indoor vertical farms?,"Image above: Algae production using a geothermal energy source. Image credit: Algaennovation, Iceland.

Who fancies some blue food? Really?

The theory of food colour confusion may originate from us being strongly aroused by foods on the red spectrum. Research published in Nature recently showed that we are more attracted to red coloured foods as they appear to signal better nutrition with higher calories in comparison to blue or green foods. Trichromatic vision evolved in humans as a response to improve foraging and may explain why we rely more on sight than scent when locating the most nutritious foods and fruits that are ripe and ready to eat. This is surprising to us as ‘leafy green’ farmers when we readily assume a green colour relates to health but the Nature study was more assigned to calorific colour arousal. Although our brains may not easily accept the blue colour as natural, our bodies will probably thank us if we do as blue-green algae also known as cyanobacteria has some of the best health benefits. Superfoods: Yogurt with blue Spirulina, Scottish Damsens, Blueberries and Sloes.

One particular cyanobacteria has been studied extensively over the years

Spirulina grows naturally in alkaline waters and was recognised and farmed by ancient civilisations for its medicinal qualities. The Aztecs of Mexico have a long historical relationship with Spirulina. They farmed Spirulina in large lakes, then harvested and air dried the algae to form a hard edible ‘cake’. This was often mixed with other foods and used as an energy source as these ancient people recognised it as an important functional food.

Massive health benefits that many people have still to discover

People who move beyond the colour tend to use blue-green algae for supercharging the immune system, controlling muscle spasms, detoxing heavy metals, eliminating candida, improving memory and increasing energy levels to improve exercise performance. It may also lower cholesterol and blood sugar, acting to prevent heart disease, heal wounds and improve digestion. Pretty impressive qualities for this single celled life form billions of years old.

There are two main species of the blue green algae Spirulina, Arthrospira platensis and Arthrospira maxima. As the image demonstrates, they are made up of single cells containing chlorophyll filled vesicles that react to light and photosynthesize like plants. Cultivation of commercial algae usually starts the life cycle in lab culture tubes, doubling quickly under controlled conditions. This helps to eliminate contaminants. Spirulina is the largest single celled blue green algae and it forms spirals visible to the human eye which bunch together to allow a quick harvest and is now cultivated worldwide as a nutritional supplement.

Spirulina is high in iron, calcium, magnesium, copper, beta-carotene and B-vitamins.

Apart from the high content of protein, Spirulina contains B vitamins, particularly B12 and provitamin A (β-carotenes), and minerals, especially iron. It is also rich in phenolic acids, tocopherols and γ-linolenic acid. Spirulina does not have a cellulose cell wall so it is more easily digested. Most people selling dried Spirulina suggest 1-8g per day to boost the immune system but be careful as too much can have negative effects so it’s best to start with the lowest dose.

Some suggest Spirulina has the power to tackle world wide problems like malnutrition. The UN and WHO recommend Spirulina for it’s extremely high nutritional value and sustainability. It has even been called the ‘world’s most sustainable food’ with the potential to end world hunger. The Pole Pole Foundation in the Congo were finalists in the Earthshot Prize recently. They are leading the way to teach communities in developing countries how to grow Spirulina as a supplement to prevent childhood malnutrition.

Could Spirulina be an alternative vegan protein source?

Would you drink blue milk? Many vegans are looking for alternative sources of protein. Spirulina might even be a protein source of the future and a substitute for cow’s milk. Spirulina platensis stands out for being one of the richest protein sources of microbial origin having similar protein levels when compared to meat and soybeans. Not to be confused with regular green Spirulina in its basic form, blue Spirulina is an extract of the active ingredient phycocyanin in its purest form. This concentrates the dried extract with higher levels of antioxidants without so much of the fishy taste of fresh Spirulina. But if you don’t mind using fresh Spirulina (it’s fishy so it’s much better to mix with stronger flavours) it will provide protein that is quickly and easily absorbed in the body compared to animal proteins which is a bonus as it contains many essential amino acids that the body cannot synthesize alone and are essential for tissue renewal.

Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory

Fresh Spirulina is high in antioxidants, especially phycocyanin, the pigment which causes the blue green colour. Phycocyanin can promote blood cell regeneration, improve lymphocyte activity and improve the lymphatic system. Studies have shown this antioxidant scavenges and fights the free radicals that cause oxidative damage.

Spirulina is known to be alkalizing to the body which boosts beneficial microflora in the gut. Liver function is improved and this greatly increases detoxification levels in the body. Fresh Spirulina contains chlorophyll and phycocyanin both of which help to remove toxins such as heavy metals and other pollutants from the blood. One remarkable study in children who lived close to Chernobyl after the nuclear disaster in 1986 found that giving them a small 5g dose of Spirulina a day could reduce radionuclide rates by half in less than two months.

Spirulina has Cancer fighting benefits

Spirulina has been hailed as an anticancer superfood, but reading further into peer reviewed literature is important as there are some extrapolated and conflicting reports from doing a simple google search. So here we only present peer reviewed data. From our research low dose Spirulina has anti-proliferation effects on stomach cancer cells, human leukaemia cells and B lymphoma cells, inhibiting carcinogenesis.

Eating Spirulina daily may lead to increased energy levels

Fresh Spirulina is particularly good for energy owing to its high nutrient density. Since the algae has no cell wall to break down, digestion of all those nutrients is fast and efficient. It can make a difference to energy levels quickly after consumption. Fresh Spirulina contains constituents such as polysaccharides (Rhamnose and Glycogen) and essential fats that are absorbed easily by cells and theoretically aid energy release. More studies are needed to be truly conclusive though but with low toxicity levels in the body, it’s well worth your own trials.

Spirulina enhances energy performance because it unlocks sugar from our cells. If you are suffering from memory loss, this bacteria added daily to your routine appears to have significant effects. It does this by protecting the brain from free-radical damage by increasing the activity of two enzymes: catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which fight free radicals and make the brain more resistant to aging.

But It’s not all good news

Spirulina may exacerbate autoimmune reactions in some people who are susceptible. As such it may worsen symptoms of multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions linked to overactive immune systems. It’s also not recommended for pregnant women or children or people on blood thinners like warfarin. Be cautious where you purchase Spirulina, as it may be contaminated if not bought from a quality source, leading to additional side effects.

Bioavailability: Should it be dried or is live culture better?

Image credit: Ecoduna, Austria If you search for Spirulina online you are mainly going to encounter powdered products. There is nothing wrong with these as most research was conducted on using powdered forms which still showed positive results. However some reports suggest fresh Spirulina has up to 95% bioavailability. This means that 95% of the nutrients including essential amino acids, all the B vitamins and antioxidants are absorbed straight into your bloodstream increasing potency by 45% compared with powder.

How difficult is it to cultivate and commercialize?

Spirulina cultivation requires sufficient aeration, agitation and proper light intensity for enhanced biomass yield, cell productivity, specific growth rate and protein content. Biomass yield has the potential to reach up to 12g/l biomass in a closed reactor system. Urea seems to be a promising alternative source of low-cost nitrogen for Spirulina cultures and addition of mechanised aeration will significantly increase yields. Spirulina vats in a hothouse, Mexico

But what about algal blooms? Are they the same Cyanobacteria?

Spirulina itself is non toxic but other forms of blue green algae including Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, grown and harvested in the wild, is often contaminated and leads to toxic conditions when out of control.

Blue-green algae occurs naturally in lochs, ponds, reservoirs, rivers and the sea. This summer in Scotland it became a real issue. When the conditions are right, blue green algae will create massive blooms so large they can be captured by satellite imaging from space. Blooms are accelerated by leaching of fertilisers, with nitrogen and phosphorus runoff into the water course which becomes detrimental to other life forms by blocking oxygen and releasing toxic microcystins.

So it’s a logical step to grow these in a controlled environment and if market conditions continue to accelerate consumer demand for functional foods then growing these super algae in CEA could be highly profitable for farmers.

Image credit: Earthrise The largest US producer of Spirulina is based in California and they produce on an open 108 acre site, exporting to over 20 countries worldwide. There are disadvantages of open ponds as they do not reach high biomass productivity due to the difficulty of maintaining the optimum temperature and so they are restricted to tropical and subtropical regions. This is mitigated to some extent with large paddles constantly moving the ponds.

Despite this hefty competition, CEA could be the perfect vehicle for growing a crop that has incredible health properties, sequesters CO2 and can be grown in tubing to eliminate contamination. With LED lights and agitation, enhanced yields could be harvested year round.

This could be particularly useful between the shoulder winter months to increase profits and farm skills where wholesale prices have the potential to return profits of up to $15/Kg . A rough estimate of 12g/L biomass can be achieved with a photobioreactor system incorporating PPFD 166 μmol photons m−2 s−1 with potential doubling every 2-6 days depending on the algal species chosen. Based on this, and assuming you harvest 50% at each doubling time, a microfarm running 100L tanks could harvest 0.6Kg every 2 days, giving a total annual yield of 106.2Kg and a potential maximum annual return of $1593. Scaling up production will make more economic sense. Optimizing and automating additional technology (LED lighting, CO2 enhancement and state of the art infrastructure as seen with Algaennovation) may boost production but this must be carefully managed to balance a return on investment.

Learning and applying new ideas – food, fuel & carbon trap

Image courtesy of Energy Futures living laboratory project, Lille France We like to get people talking about the future diversity of CEA. This helps drive innovation and creates wider jobs and skills. At the same time we aim to help you better understand the science and health prospects of plants that could be grown in CEA. Of all the ideas out there, maybe our favourite is the idea of an algae curtain. Glow in the dark tubes of algae obscure prying eyes from your space while producing your own superfood or fuel. Could plants literally fuel plants in a completely carbon neutral circular economy? Biodiesel produced using algae contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and highly biodegradable. This could have potential in offsetting CEA energy outputs and algae fuel cells could make home farms more economically sustainable in the future. There are so many applications for algae, some are even using it to extract CO2 from brewing. Whatever reason you have for growing Spirulina and others (chlorella) there is no doubt about this being classed as a superfood.

Closer to home we like the way CEA farmers are looking to diversify their product range and kudos to On the Grow farms in Rockwall, Texas, growing spirulina alongside their microgreens. They grow in demijohn bottles adjusting the salinity to 2 and pH 10.5-11, harvesting and topping up fresh water every day. In order to maintain high pH and avoid fluctuations, high amounts of sodium bicarbonate must always be included in the culture medium to buffer the solution. The water needs aeration and temperature needs to be tightly regulated to 80F. LED lights will speed up production and your farm will literally bloom. Image credit: On The Grow Farms, Texas

Spirulina first rose to fame as a potential space food. Maybe in space our brains are altered by gravity to be more accepting of blue food. Or maybe we will discover a whole new superfood bacterial species on Mars or deep in the ocean. So who’s got a spare shelf in their vertical farm for this blue superfood and space age protein milk shake? Janet Colston PhD is pharmacologist with an interest in growing ‘functional’ foods that have additional phytonutrients and display medicinal qualities that are beneficial to human health. She grows these using a range of techniques including plant tissue micropropagation and controlled environmental agriculture to ensure the highest quality control.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,"Spirulina: Uses, Benefits, Side Effects, Dosage, Precautions","Spirulina is a blue-green algae from the genus Arthrospira (""arthro"" roughly meaning ""joint,"" and ""spira"" meaning ""spiral""). It's been used by the Aztecs in Mexico and people living in the Lake Chad area in Africa for centuries. Spirulina's usually cultivated from bodies of water like lakes or farmed in ponds.

Spirulina contains several nutrients, including fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, and K), fatty acids (DHA, EPA), beta carotene and minerals. It's also a source of protein, but it lacks high enough levels of some of the amino acids that your body needs to function at its best (unless you have a medical condition where you need to avoid specific amino acids, like phenylketonuria or ""PKU""). Since spirulina comes from bacteria (specifically ""cyanobacteria""), it may be considered a protein source for vegans.

It's also important to note that the B12 in spirulina is in a different form as ""pseudovitamin B12"" than the type typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs, especially if you follow a vegetarian or vegan way of eating, which can be low in B12. Lower levels of B12 are also found in adults over the age of 60. And why's B12 important? Because your body needs B12 to make red blood cells, it's also crucial for brain and nerve cell development. Not getting enough B12 can cause tiredness, memory loss, depression, and even different types of anemia.

This article takes a closer look at the potential uses of spirulina and the risks associated with its use.

Dietary supplements are not regulated in the United States, meaning the FDA does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement that has been tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn’t mean that they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about any potential interactions with other supplements or medications.

Uses of Spirulina

Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare provider, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD/RDN), or pharmacist. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease.



Spirulina has fat-soluble vitamins (like A, E, and K), beta carotene and minerals, protein, and phycocyanins (pigments that produce a blue color and have shown antioxidant effects). Phycocyanins have been used as a dye in many industries, including pharmacy, culinary, and even cosmetics.

Scientists have studied, but not necessarily proven, spirulina's impact on different areas of health, including but not limited to:

We'll explore what the science says about spirulina's effectiveness for these health outcomes.



Antioxidant capacity

According to a meta-analysis (a collection of research studies) of nine studies with a total of 415 people, spirulina increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The studies used anywhere from one to eight grams of spirulina per day, a pretty extensive range. Many of the studies had a relatively small number of people, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much. The strength of the effects was not earth-shattering and was generally more substantial when people took five grams of spirulina per day or more.

The conclusion? Getting antioxidants from the foods that we eat can help reduce some of the inflammation in our bodies. To amp up antioxidants in your diet, try including a variety of the most nutrient-dense foods that you can source and afford - and they don't have to be organic - like whole grains, fruit, and vegetables to help increase your body's antioxidant capacity and reduce inflammation in your body. Just don't rely on spirulina alone.

Blood pressure

Scientists did a meta-analysis (a collection of several research studies on a topic) of five randomized controlled trials that included 230 people to check spirulina's effects on blood pressure. The people in the different studies took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina a day. The lengths of the studies were anywhere from two to 12 weeks, and many of the studies were pretty small, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much.

When the data was pooled (put together) and analyzed from these studies, the scientists said that spirulina lowered systolic blood pressure by about 4.59 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure 7.02 millimeters of mercury. Systolic pressure (top number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. Diastolic pressure (bottom number) measures the pressure your arteries experience between each heartbeat. The biggest blood pressure-lowering in the studies was seen in people who had high blood pressure already.

The scientists also said more high-quality studies are needed before we can start recommending that everyone with high blood pressure needs to start eating spirulina.

Blood sugar control

Have you ever gotten a jittery feeling after eating sugary food? That usually means your blood sugar's spiking. And this situation can be dire for people coping with conditions like type I or type II diabetes, disordered eating including diabulimia, and more.

Over time, blood sugar spikes that are left uncontrolled can actually lead to damage to your body. Worst case, in certain conditions like diabetes, that can look like having to surgically remove parts of your body (amputation), heart attacks, kidney failure, or stroke, which can lead to paralysis of parts of your body. While spirulina really would not likely be able to correct severe damage from uncontrolled blood sugar over time by itself, it has lowered blood sugar levels in human studies. And why? It could be its protein and fiber content, or perhaps it is phycocyanin's ability to help with inflammation. Scientists are still figuring it out.

Fourteen studies with 510 people with metabolic syndrome–a collection of symptoms like high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (""good cholesterol""), and high waist circumference, which altogether can create more severe health problems–were included in a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on blood sugar and other outcomes. And a lot of those studies didn't have many people in them, meaning they had lower statistical power. People took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina per day. Blood sugar and insulin levels were reduced in some of the studies after taking specific amounts of spirulina. More high-quality studies are needed before healthcare providers can recommend spirulina for lowering blood sugar and insulin levels.

Generally, working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN), particularly a Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist (CDCES), can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. RDs/RDNs can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to avoid spikes in your blood sugar, which could help you feel better. Remember, managing blood sugar can be challenging, and you don't have to do it alone!

Cancer

Unfortunately, very few well-conducted human studies have looked at spirulina's effects on cancer. There've been several studies in test tube cells or in animals that aren't humans. However, more well-constructed studies looking at its effects on humans are needed.



Cholesterol levels

Scientists conducted a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on cholesterol levels that had seven controlled trials for a total of 522 total people. They found that spirulina reduced: total cholesterol (by 46.76 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)), low-density lipoprotein (LDL by 41.32 milligrams per deciliter), and triglycerides (by 44.23 milligrams per deciliter). It also increased the ""good"" cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL by 6.06 milligrams per deciliter). Again, why did spirulina do this? We're not sure, but scientists think it may be due to its nutritional profile (fiber, fatty acids like DHA and EPA), its antioxidant capacity, or a combination of these.



While healthcare providers cannot recommend spirulina for lowering your cholesterol, they can suggest working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) to help you explore your eating patterns, movement, and more. Registered dietitian nutritionists can help you build your toolkit and your capacity. Again, you're not alone!

Liver health

Spirulina has been studied for its effects on liver health in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the study was very small (only 13 people), so we can't draw any conclusions about spirulina for NAFLD until larger and better studies are done.

Metabolic syndrome

Scientists have studied spirulina's effects on metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome happens when you have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist (excess abdominal fat). Metabolic syndrome can wreak havoc with your health and increases your odds of heart attack, stroke, and type two diabetes. One of metabolic syndrome's main causes is thought to be obesity. Obesity, however, can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass.

One spirulina meta-analysis pulled together data from 18 studies. It suggested that spirulina could help lower high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, which are all parts of metabolic syndrome. It's important to note that while spirulina may impact these outcomes, the most essential issue would be working on your current way of eating, your movement (exercise), and other equally important issues like addressing your emotional health. Spirulina can't solve these serious issues.

Consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and perhaps one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. In addition, they can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to help you feel better. Sometimes it can be challenging to give yourself permission to ask for and accept help. But you've got this. And you don't have to go at it alone.

Obesity

In a meta-analysis of five studies, scientists looked at spirulina's effects on weight management in people coping with obesity. Spirulina did decrease weight in people with obesity by 4.55 pounds and in people who were overweight by 2.82 pounds. However, clinically speaking, this is not enough to make a solid recommendation for use of spirulina for obesity treatment.

As mentioned previously, it's important to note that obesity can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass. And BMI does not give the complete picture of an individual's well-being. Consider requesting a body composition test (for example, skin-fold measurements or a DEXA Body Composition scan) from your healthcare provider in addition to other parameters that they may measure.

As mentioned above, consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and, ideally, one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). CSOWM RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. They can help you build your toolkit and your capacity, and help you feel better. You've got this.



What Are the Side Effects of Spirulina?

An allergic reaction may be possible in those allergic to spirulina. Allergic reactions would include rash or swelling. Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience side effects and call your healthcare provider.



Common Side Effects

Spirulina is generally safe, but some people have reported the following with its use:

Allergy

Headache

Muscle pain

Sweating

Trouble sleeping



Severe Side Effects

While severe side effects from spirulina are rare, be aware that the following have occurred:

Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

(severe allergic reaction) Throat swelling

Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience severe side effects and call your healthcare provider.

Precautions

People with phenylketonuria (inability to process the amino acid phenylalanine) and individuals with other amino acid disorders, for example, classical homocystinuria (HCU), or maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), may need to avoid spirulina due to its high protein and thus amino acid content.



The safety of spirulina in pregnant or nursing people has not been established. Speak with your healthcare provider before using spirulina if you're pregnant, plan to get pregnant or if you're breastfeeding.

Please don't give children supplements–including spirulina–without discussing this with their pediatrician first.

Spirulina can sometimes be contaminated with things like lead or other heavy metals (it grows in lakes, after all) or even toxins.



Dosage: How Much Spirulina Should I Take?

Always speak with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement to ensure that the supplement and dosage are appropriate for your individual needs.



Manufacturer recommendations might vary. As a general guideline though, don't use more than what's listed on your product's label. There's no recommended ""effective"" dosage of spirulina. Avoid spirulina if you're allergic or sensitive to it or any of its ingredients. Studies have used from one to 10 grams a day for up to six months to 19 grams of spirulina a day for up two months, with a relatively good safety profile in people with different conditions.



Again, please do not give supplements to children without first discussing this with their pediatrician.

What Happens If I Take Too Much Spirulina?

An upper limit or recommended intake is lacking for spirulina. Taking upwards of 40 grams per day for an unknown period of time has been noted. If you believe that you've taken too much spirulina, contact your healthcare provider for information.



Interactions

Blood thinners: While there are only about 0.26 micrograms of vitamin K in each gram of spirulina, taking far larger amounts could theoretically impact the blood-thinning effects of some medicines like Jantoven (warfarin).

Immunomodulators: Little evidence exists to support avoiding the use of spirulina with immunosuppressive drugs or drugs that change the way that the immune system works (immunomodulators).

It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included. Please review this supplement label with your healthcare provider to discuss any potential interactions with foods, other supplements, and medications.



How to Store Spirulina

Store spirulina in a cool, dry place. Keep spirulina away from direct sunlight. Discard as indicated by the ""use by"" date on the packaging. Keep away from children and pets.



Similar Supplements

Chlorella (a green algae supplement) is somewhat similar to spirulina.

Frequently Asked Questions Is spirulina the same as chlorella? No, chlorella and spirulina are different species of algae, but they're both supplements.

What antioxidants does spirulina have? Spirulina has phycocyanins.

If I'm a vegan, can I get all my protein and B12 needs from spirulina? While spirulina has most of the amino acids that your body needs, it doesn't have enough of some of them. Try to eat a balanced, varied diet to meet your unique protein needs. The B12 in spirulina–pseudovitamin B12–is in a different form than the type that's typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs.

Sources of Spirulina & What to Look For

Blue-green algae species used in spirulina supplements are typically Spirulina maxima, Spirulina platensis, or Aphanizomenon flos-aquae.



Just because a remedy is thought to be ""natural"" does not mean that it is safe. Some ""wild-crafted"" spirulina products may have been grown in water contaminated with heavy metals (mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium) or other pollutants. Opt for supplements produced in labs and certified by third-party authorities like the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF International.



As with all supplements, it's essential to talk with your healthcare provider before using spirulina to decide if it's right for you.

This article was previously published April 8, 2019, and has been updated with new information.

In 2018, James DiNicolantonio, co-author of my book, “Superfuel,” published a groundbreaking paper,1 “Antioxidant Bilirubin Works in Multiple Ways to Reduce Risk for Obesity and Its Health Complications.”

Bilirubin is a breakdown product of red blood cells (heme) and the chemical responsible for the yellow color of bruises, urine and jaundice.

In that paper, DiNicolantonio explains how bilirubin inhibits NADPH oxidase (typically abbreviated as NOX) — a metabolic enzyme activated in a large number of pathological conditions that generates a great deal of oxidative stress — and how phycocyanobilin found in spirulina can exert similar effects.

The reason for this is because the phycocyanobilin found in spirulina is rapidly reduced to phycocyanorubin, a close homolog of bilirubin, in mammalian cells.2,3 In a follow-up paper4 published March 2019, DiNicolantonio, et.al, propose that elevated bilirubin might aid weight control by preventing the development of leptin resistance, and discuss evidence suggesting spirulina may be an effective way to combat leptin resistance as well.

Bilirubin Can Play a Role in Chronic Disease

When a newborn baby gets jaundice, he is placed under “bili lights” in the hospital nursery to prevent brain damage (kernicterus), should his bilirubin levels become too high. The blue lights break down the bilirubin so it can be excreted. However, at appropriate levels, bilirubin has a strong free radial scavenging effect.

Until recently, scientists were unaware that bilirubin may actually have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and atheroprotective properties, and there is a growing body of scientific and clinical evidence to support this.

From an evolutionary/biological perspective, it also makes sense that nature would have created a way for your body to break down heme,5 which can be toxic if it accumulates. The way bilirubin is thought to provide these health benefits is through its ability to inhibit NOX.

In fact, NOX overactivity appears to play a significant role in a wide range of health conditions, including but not limited to vascular diseases and vascular complications of other diseases (diabetes, kidney failure, blindness and heart disease, for example), insulin resistance, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, cancer, glaucoma, pulmonary fibrosis and erectile dysfunction.

It follows then that preventing many chronic diseases would require finding a means of inhibiting or modulating NOX. Bilirubin is believed to assist with this modulating effect.

People with Gilbert Syndrome comprise 3 to 7% of the population6,7 and illustrate this phenomenon quite nicely, as they are genetically predisposed to chronically elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin.

These individuals, having two to three times as much bilirubin as the rest of us after a 24-hour fast,8 enjoy a greatly reduced risk for coronary artery disease, hypertension, carotid atherosclerosis and overall mortality, and this protection is thought to be related to their high bilirubin levels.9

Spirulina — An Effective NADPH Oxidase Inhibitor

Since phycocyanobilin is a very close relative of bilirubin — and spirulina is a great source of phycocyanobilin — spirulina has enormous clinical potential due to its NOX inhibiting effect. This is why phycocyanobilin has been the focus of a large amount of research.

Phycobilin extracts have been shown to inhibit NOX activity in human aortic endothelium, aortic smooth muscle and renal cell cultures. And bilirubin protects against diabetic nephropathy via downregulation of NOX in rats.

As DiNicolantonio’s 2018 paper10 explains, bilirubin reduces the risk for obesity and related health problems through a number of mechanisms, but primarily by inhibiting NOX complexes.

Downregulating NOX activity — which can be done with spirulina, thanks to its bilirubin-mimicking phycocyanobilin — could therefore have “profound implications for preservation of metabolic and vascular health.” As further explained by the authors:

“Expression of inducible form of heme oxygenase, HO-1, can be boosted by oxidative stress — often derived from NADPH oxidase [NOX] activity; the resultant production of bilirubin feeds back to quell this oxidative stress …

[Phycocyanobilin, which is covalently attached to phycocyanin] is readily converted by biliverdin reductase to the bilirubin analogue phycocyanorubin, which appears to share bilirubin’s ability to inhibit NADPH oxidase [NOX] complexes. Arguably, this may largely explain the versatile antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of oral spirulina … in rodent studies …

A recent cross-sectional epidemiological study evaluating subjects with [Gilbert Syndrome] has discovered that [Gilbert Syndrome] is associated with a reduced tendency to gain body fat in later life … A reasonable deduction is that chronically elevated free unconjugated bilirubin — and perhaps an upregulation in intracellular bilirubin generation — somehow opposes age-related gain in body fat.

Of related interest is a study showing that intraperitoneal administration of bilirubin — administered daily for 14 days — inhibits weight gain in rats fed a diet high in fats and sugar. Bilirubin injections were also found to prevent deterioration of glucose tolerance …

A credible case can be made that the favorable impact of elevated bilirubin on risk for undesirable weight gain reflects preservation of hypothalamic leptin sensitivity …

Activation of NADPH oxidase [NOX] is a key mediator of proinflammatory microglial activation; hence, elevated bilirubin might be expected to support effective leptin function in the arcuate nucleus, thereby aiding appetite control.

Oxidative stress in adipocytes, stemming largely from NADPH oxidase [NOX] activity, appears to play a key role in the induction of insulin resistance and the skewing of adipokine and cytokine production in hypertrophied adipocytes.

Hence, bilirubin and heme oxygenase activity could be expected to aid maintenance of adipocyte insulin sensitivity. Indeed, plasma levels of unconjugated bilirubin have been found to correlate inversely with risk for metabolic syndrome and diabetes in prospective epidemiological studies, as confirmed in a recent meta-analysis.

In both cross-sectional and prospective studies, higher plasma bilirubin levels are associated with better insulin sensitivity and decreased risk for metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes — independent of BMI … A direct protective effect of bilirubin on adipocyte function may be largely responsible for this phenomenon.”

Leptin Resistance: A Hallmark of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes

In order for you to significantly gain weight, you must first become leptin resistant. Leptin is a hormone that helps you regulate your appetite. When your leptin levels rise, it signals your body that you’re full, so you’ll stop eating.

However, as you become increasingly resistant to the effects of leptin, you end up eating more. The question then is: what drives this basic process? Why do you become leptin resistant in the first place?

Research by Dr. Richard Johnson — head of nephrology at the University of Colorado who has published more than 500 medical papers and written a number of books on obesity — clearly shows that refined sugar (in particular fructose) is exceptionally effective at causing leptin resistance in animals and blocks the burning of fat.

Most overweight Americans have some degree of insulin and leptin resistance. This also includes people with diabetes, and many individuals with high blood pressure or high cholesterol. If you fall into this category, it would be prudent for you to restrict fructose to about 15 to 25 grams per day from all sources.

In his most recent paper,11 DiNicolantonio and his co-authors hypothesize that spirulina supplementation may also be an effective treatment for leptin resistance.

Bilirubin Protects Against Weight Gain

As mentioned earlier, people with Gilbert Syndrome are genetically predisposed to chronically elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin. This not only appears to protect them from heart disease and overall mortality, but also prevents body fat accumulation, especially during later years, and hypothalamic leptin resistance is one known condition that promotes weight gain as you grow older.12

Research has shown that leptin injections have no effect on obesity. “Studies in rodents with diet-induced obesity suggest that this phenomenon reflects a loss of leptin responsiveness that is specific to the arcuate nucleus,” DiNicolantonio notes.13

Research also suggests that diet-induced obesity is related to the activation of microglia (glial cells that function as scavengers) in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH).14 Again, NOX plays an important role. Activation of microglia also leads to the production of toxic oxidants such as peroxynitrite and other proinflammatory cytokines.

As noted by DiNicolantonio, “Hence, it is straightforward to propose that bilirubin may have the ability to downregulate microglial activation by diminishing NADPH oxidase activation.” That said, bilirubin does not appear to be able to influence leptin activity until or unless leptin resistance has actually developed.

Spirulina May Combat Leptin Resistance by Mimicking Bilirubin

Now, while raising your bilirubin level could potentially protect you from obesity and diabetes, it’s not a useful nutraceutical in and of itself, and this is where spirulina comes in, as the phycocyanobilin found in spirulina is very similar to bilirubin. DiNicolantonio sums it up as follows:15

“If the hypothesis presented here is correct, the far lower body fat in older subjects with Gilbert Syndrome reflects the ability of bilirubin to suppress the activation and proliferation of microglia in the MBH.

The extent to which this expansion of activated microglia — and the associated impact on the function of leptin-responsive neurons — can be reversed by elevation of bilirubin (or administration of phycocyanobilin) in patients who have already developed obesity with leptin resistance remains to be seen.

Particularly because microglial mass increases, it may be rash to assume that this syndrome is fully reversible. If phycocyanobilin does prove to have utility for controlling hypothalamic inflammation, its greatest impact on obesity will likely be achieved by long-term administration in a preventive mode.

In any case, studies evaluating the impact of bilirubin or phycocyanobilin administration on the development of hypothalamic leptin resistance in fat-fed rodents appear to be warranted … Two studies have been published very recently in which inclusion of spirulina in the diet has been shown to inhibit gain in body weight and fat in rats fed a high-fat diet; these appear to be the first studies to have evaluated spirulina’s impact in this regard.

Although neither of these studies focused on leptin function, the fact that markers of adipose tissue browning were higher in rats receiving spirulina is consistent with effective leptin function in these rats.

Moreover, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial has also emerged, in which spirulina supplementation (at only 2 grams daily) was found to potentiate loss of body fat, body weight, waist circumference and BMI in overweight subjects placed on a calorie-restricted diet; reductions in triglycerides and C reactive protein were also greater in the spirulina group.

Bilirubin mimesis [imitation or mimicry] may represent one example of a more general strategy for preventing or reversing inappropriate weight gain: counteracting hypothalamic leptin resistance or upregulating hypothalamic leptin signaling.”

Spirulina Types, Dosing and Potential Adverse Reactions

There are many types of spirulina on the market, so do your homework before making a purchase. Since spirulina grown in an uncontrolled environment has the potential to become contaminated with heavy metals and other toxins, it is important to choose organic spirulina from a reputable source.

Spirulina comes in capsules, tablets, powders and flakes. Dosing depends on what you plan to use it for and to whom it is given. A general starting dose for adults is typically around 3 grams. For disease prevention, you may work your way up to 20 grams per day. The adult maintenance dose is typically around 10 grams a day.

Remember to increase your intake of spring water or filtered water when taking spirulina to help it absorb into your system. Also be aware that spirulina is a potent detoxifier, so depending on your toxic burden, you may or may not experience a detox reaction. For that reason, it is best to start with a small dose and work your way up.

Though there are no known side effects associated with spirulina, your body may react to it based on your current state of health. Some of the most prominent reactions you may experience include:

Slight fever — The high protein content in spirulina increases metabolism, which may elevate body temperature Dark green stool — Spirulina can remove accumulated waste products in your colon, which may cause darker stool. Also, spirulina is high in chlorophyll, which turns your stool green Gas — Buildup of gas may indicate that your digestive system is not functioning properly Excitability — Your body is converting protein into heat energy, which may cause temporary feelings of restlessness Breakouts and/or itchy skin — This is caused by the colon cleansing process and is a temporary reaction Sleepiness — This is caused by the detoxification process and may indicate your body is exhausted and needs more rest

Also keep in mind that while spirulina is entirely natural and generally considered a healthy food, there are some important contraindications you need to be aware of. Avoid spirulina if you are:16

Severely allergic to seafood

Allergic to iodine

Pregnant

Nursing

If you have hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), consult your health care provider before taking spirulina. Also avoid taking spirulina if you are currently running a fever, as it may raise it further. Also, do not take spirulina if you have an autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, or if you a metabolic condition called phenylketonuria (PKU).

Chlorella — An Alternative if You Can’t Tolerate Spirulina

Chlorella is another form of algae that is sometimes confused with spirulina. The fundamental difference between spirulina and chlorella is that spirulina does not possess the hard cell wall that makes chlorella closer to a plant than algae. Note, however, that chlorella does not have the phycocyanobilin so it will not inhibit NOX and increase NADPH.

Chlorella is an excellent way to detoxify your body from mercury, a common problem if you have amalgam dental fillings, have received a thimerosal-containing vaccine or regularly eat contaminated fish. It is also one of nature’s highest source of chlorophyll, which has many biological benefits.

Spirulina is unable to remove heavy metals, as it lacks a cell membrane. It can, however, protect your liver against the toxic effects of heavy metals, and help eliminate other toxins, including arsenic. If for whatever reason you cannot tolerate spirulina, chlorella could be a viable alternative to obtain some of its benefits described above.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,University of Calgary researchers discover a green way to make natural blue dye,"At first, researchers Agasteswar Vadlamani and Angela Kouris were trying to find ways to produce carbon-neutral gas with organisms unique to British Columbia's Soda Lakes.

But instead, the microbial goo lead the team to a business opportunity: a natural way to create blue colourant. It's food-safe, could have health benefits and, best of all, removes CO2 from the atmosphere.

It all started with a bit of a eureka moment, when Vadlamani saw the bacteria in their lab pond was emitting a beautiful blue colour — phycocyanin. So, he approached the research team, urging them to switch gears.

""I mean, that is just like a single aha moment,"" he said. ""I realized that focusing on this has better value proposition compared to bioenergy.""

That's when they created their company: Synergia Biotech. From thereon in, the team threw themselves into commercialization — an unexpected but exciting pivot.

""That's what drives me every day,"" Vadlamani said. ""We are always excited about new discoveries, it feels great.""

Typically, Kouris said, the blue dye you see in food, wine and blue jeans is created by the same synthetic process.

There are studies showing these dyes aren't the best for your health and can be carcinogenic. Finding blue in naturally-occurring settings, she added, is quite rare.

The researchers used a biological process in a pond at the University of Calgary campus to test the concept. (Katy Whitt Photography)

The most exciting part of the process, Kouris said, is that it's environmentally friendly.

Their production harnesses a naturally-occurring bacteria known as cyanobacteria — with a little sunlight, and drawing from CO2 in the air, they are able to harvest and concentrate the blue colour into a powder.

""We're the only company, the only innovation out there that has found a way to produce phycocyanin by capturing carbon in the atmosphere,"" Kouris said. ""All other technologies rely on carbon intensive processes.""

With their model, Kouris said they also see a new revenue stream in the Canadian agricultural field.

Right now, a big obstacle is scaling up, so the company is building a facility to help up production which should be ready to go in 2022.",,[]
phycocyanin,phycocyanin,"Venus sounds like the last place for life, but…could photosynthesis happen in its clouds?","Raging with unbearable heat and covered in swirls of toxic clouds, Venus is a hell world for humans. But something might actually be able to live in its atmosphere.

The clouds of sulfuric acid above Venus could — at least hypothetically — be a haven for photosynthesis. No alien algae or other photosynthetic organisms have actually been found there yet, but biochemist Rakesh Mogul of California State Polytechnic University recently led a study, published in Astrobiology, about how this could happen. What is poison for one life-form could make it possible for another to survive.

Venus is a place where even spacecraft fear to tread. Every lander that has touched the radiation-blasted surface has met an untimely death. Far above that surface, its skies might have some hidden advantages for hypothetical phototrophs, organisms that use light as an energy source to power up their metabolisms.

“We found that several packets of wavelengths, which pass through Venus’ atmosphere, overlap with the absorption properties of many terrestrial photosynthetic pigments,” he tells SYFY WIRE. “The light that remains in the clouds represents the groups of wavelengths available for photosynthesis.”

Phycocyanin, which gives cyanobacteria (aka blue-green algae) its unearthly blue color, could possibly thrive in the Venusian clouds, since it can absorb the wavelengths of light that come through. These wavelengths are similar to those that can be absorbed by photosynthetic organisms on Earth. (Some people swear by it as a supplement. No, really.) So could bacteriochlorophyll b, which offers an assist to organisms that photosynthesize wavelengths of light that most plants and cyanobacteria cannot use. These phototropic bacteria do not release oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis.

Searching for extraterrestrial life means recognizing substances and processes close to those on our planet while also being prepared to find life as we don’t know it or don’t usually recognize it. After light scatters through Earth’s atmosphere, what is available for photosynthesis remains on the surface as opposed to the leftovers lingering in the clouds of Venus. However, heat from the infernal surface of Venus rises up to the atmosphere. Both that and heat in the atmosphere itself include photons whose wavelengths are an asset to some photosynthetic pigments.

While that might sound conducive to something like algae or phytoplankton thriving, how could they make it in noxious clouds of sulfur dioxide that are constantly irradiated by the Sun?

“The clouds in Venus have substantial abundances of sulfur dioxide and other unidentified chemical species that absorb and scatter UV and visible radiation, scrubbing the atmosphere of most of the harmful UV rays,” Mogul says.

What results from this is ammonium bisulfate and other neutralized forms of sulfuric acid that were observed to show higher water activity than what was previously assumed. This is because of molecular properties that have certain effects on water molecules. Sulfuric acid is something of a double agent before it is neutralized, because while it reacts with H2O, it also sticks to it, making less water available for living things. Ammonium bisulfate, which is also less acidic, doesn’t stick nearly as well, freeing up that water for other types of chemical reactions.

So much for the clouds of Venus being supposedly too dry and acidic to support anything that would need water to stay alive.

Even more amazing is that photosynthesis could even be possible at night on Venus. It already happens in environments with hardly any light on Earth, such as hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean. The photon fluxes on Venus were found to be much higher than those on Earth. Meaning, heat and light do not scatter and vanish as quickly in the gases of the Venusian atmosphere as they do in water. Light energy in thermal or infrared forms, possibly both, rises from the surface and is retained in the clouds. Phototrophs would never want for photons.

“Venus’ surface is just so hot that a major amount of thermal radiation is given off, this makes the atmosphere hot,” Mogul says. “Together, the surface and atmosphere release photons of light due to the heat, which then rise into the clouds.”

Whether there are alien things swarming in the clouds of Venus is still unknown, but if something like that is ever discovered, the find shouldn’t be completely unexpected.",,[]

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,Marine bioactive compounds against SARS-CoV-2,"In the current era, viruses pose a significant threat to humans since they are capable of causing pandemics throughout the world. Changing environments, globalization, urbanization, population growth, and changes in transport and infrastructure have created new opportunities for viral infections to start and spread.

Review: Multifaceted role of natural sources for COVID-19 pandemic as marine drugs. ​​​​​​​Image Credit: Charlotte Bleijenberg / Shutterstock

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2019 in Wuhan, China, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus binds to the host ACE2 receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The RBD interacts with a lysine residue on the ACE2 receptor which makes it a potential pharmaceutical target. Infection with this virus results in end-stage respiratory illness, systemic involvement, and even death. Though several COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, they cannot be relied upon entirely, so additional treatments are needed.

Natural products are still considered one of the most common sources of antibacterial and antiviral medication. For several decades marine plants and microorganisms have been used in scientific inquiry. Marine creatures have developed various anti-infective techniques and chemicals to defend themselves against viruses and microorganisms that reside in the ocean. There are several advantages to utilizing these marine resources due to their ecological safety, physiological compatibility, and low toxin levels.

Antiviral properties of several natural substances derived from marine resources are currently being studied against COVID-19. Some of the compounds show similar efficacy, while few are more potent than the approved drugs. One such example is Phycocyanobilins (PCBs) and sulfated polysaccharides that bind and inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with higher affinity as compared to the traditional drug remdesivir. Natural inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) that is derived from marine microorganisms and sponges has been reported to protect against severe COVID-19. Additionally, various marine metabolites that are derived from scleractinian-related animals, algae, and sponges have been found to interact with a major SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro. Mpro is an enzyme that plays an important role in viral replication and transcription. Marine-derived compounds can also target SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (S), nucleocapsid proteins (N), matrix glycoproteins (M), tiny envelope proteins (E) as well as 3CLpro, which is also involved in replication, transcription, and maturation of the virus.

A new review paper published in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research aimed to determine the possibilities of using biologically active compounds derived from various chemical classes of marine organisms against SARS-CoV-2 infection at various stages of the life cycle of the virus.

COVID-19 viral pathogenesis

Coronaviruses have two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. Coronavirinae subfamily comprises four genera, alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus whose genome is enveloped and connected to a nucleoprotein (N). The membrane (M) and envelope protein (E) help in virus assembly, while the spike protein (S) helps in the entry of the virus inside the host cell. Non-structural proteins that help in the viral lifecycle are 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, and papain-like protease (PLpro).

Immune response and symptoms of COVID-19

SARS-CoV-2 can attack the respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, kidney, liver, heart, and central nervous system and cause multiple organ failures. The initial immunological response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection is the release of cytokines and immune-cell infiltration that results in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 in most patients. However, in the case of serious disease, a downregulation of immune response has been observed.

COVID-19 symptoms can range from moderate to severe, with headache, nasal congestion, loss of taste and smell, fever, sore throat, breathing difficulties, muscle pain, and diarrhea being the most common symptoms.

Coronavirus lifecycle and targets for the development of antiviral agents

The SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle begins with the interaction of the spike protein RBD with the ACE2 receptor that is expressed on the endothelial surface in the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Thereafter, the virus enters inside the host cell through the fusion of the viral and host cell membrane along with endocytosis with the help of the spike protein’s S2 subunit.

The cellular protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the spike protein once the spike protein-ACE2 complex is formed leading to the fusion with the host membrane and release of the viral genome. Other proteases such as plasmin, trypsin, and factor Xa are also involved in the process. Endocytosis is brought about by endolysosomes furin and cathepsin B/L (CatB/L). Therefore, therapies that can prevent one or more events in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2 are now being developed with the important targets being receptor binding and membrane fusion.

Inhibitors of unspecific attachment of the virus to the factors on the host cell surface

Unspecific attachment can help to raise the viral particle concentrations in the environment, thereby leading to higher infection rates. The attachment and penetration inhibitors can bind to virus receptor molecules on the surface of susceptible cells, to an intermediate, “activated” version of viral protein, and to specific proteins directly in the virion to prevent any further structural changes. These inhibitors can be used in antiviral drugs. A few of the common inhibitors are lectins and glycosaminoglycan mimetics.

Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that can recognize and reversibly bind to complex glycoconjugates moieties without affecting any covalent structures. Species that include lectins are algae, marine corals, fungi, prokaryotes, higher plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates. Mannose-binding lectins are quite important in antiviral research since they can prevent virus self-assembly during replication.

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long sulfated polysaccharides whose expression occurs on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix. SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses use GAGs for the attachment to host cells. Cell surface glycoproteins can interact with GAG to mimic heparinoid polysaccharides leading to the formation of a protective barrier that prevents viral binding.

Inhibitors of viral lipid‑dependent attachment to host cells

Lipids are important in the life cycle of viruses since they can act as direct receptors or cofactors for entry of virus entrance on the cell surface and in endosomes. In addition, certain viruses also utilize lipid rafts for some stages of their reproductive cycle.

Lipids can be altered by sterols that can be used to restrict viral replication. Other compounds such as sphingolipids and cyclodextrin can also inhibit the infectivity of several viruses, including coronaviruses. Sterols can be found in many organisms such as Arthropoda, porifera, algae, echinodermata, tunicata, mollusks, coelenterata, bryozoa, and chordates.

Inhibitors of specific receptors and fusion of cytoplasmic and viral membranes

Compounds that interact with the spike protein and proteases can prevent the entry of the virus inside the cell and subsequent infection. Therefore, they can be used as antiviral agents. This includes ACE2 inhibitors, TMPRSS2 inhibitors as well as biologically active substances such as flavonoids, terpenes, and peptides.

Virion deproteinization

Deproteinization of the virus takes place by surface-bound proteases like TMPRSS2 and cysteine proteases in endosomes as well as other proteases such as 3CLpro, PL2pro, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and helicase. Inhibiting these proteases can interfere with the life cycle of the virus and prevent infection.

Phlorotannins, lipids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and flavonoids are reported to be important compounds that can serve as inhibitors of the major SARS-CoV-2 proteases.

Marine bioactive compounds that can act against SARS‑CoV‑2

Major marine compounds that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection are derived from Scleractinia, an order of Anthozoa which is only found in the marine environment. Approximately 15 chemicals have been derived from Scleractinia-associated organisms that have the potential to inhibit viral infection.

Other compounds such as phycocyanin, polysaccharides, lutein, vitamin E, and B12, are also derived from marine algae. One polysaccharide, lambda carrageenan which is isolated from marine red algae, has antibacterial, antiviral, anti-coagulant, and anti-cancerous properties. Both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus have been reported to be inhibited by it.

Furthermore, two Scleractinia-related metabolites have been found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, while three were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Marine compounds derived from the Aplysinidae family, Petrosia stronglyophora sp., as well as the soft coral Pterogorgia citrina can also act as inhibitors of Mpro. Other marine compounds such as PCBs and polysaccharides such as carrageenan, fucoidan, and alginate have also been identified to play a significant role in virus protection.

Clinical studies on iota-carrageenan–containing lozenges and iota-carrageenan nasal spray have revealed antiviral efficacy against influenza A, human coronaviruses, and human rhinovirus. Carrageenan-treated coronavirus-infected individuals were observed to have a shorter duration of illness and fewer relapses as compared to untreated individuals. Nucleoside inhibitors mycalisine A and B derived from marine sponge Mycale sp were also found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RdRp with greater efficacy as compared to traditional drugs such as remdesivir.

Benefits of marine sulfated polysaccharides (SPs) over other natural compounds

Marine algae thus have been identified as an excellent source of a wide range of bioactive chemicals that have antiviral, anti-coagulant, immunomodulating, cancer-fighting, and antioxidant capabilities. Recent research has highlighted the potential of marine macroalgal blooms as a never-ending source of biologically active chemicals that will lead to new therapies.

These compounds are biocompatible, safe, and biodegradable. Additionally, algae-based SPs have lower manufacturing costs as compared to plant-derived natural chemicals. Also, marine SPs being water-soluble, can be extracted using an aqueous extraction technique, making them useful in pharmaceutical businesses as their characteristics can be readily changed. Furthermore, SPs have not been linked to any known health risks in pharmaceuticals, although further research is required on their chemical characteristics, bioavailability, toxicity, and biological processes.

Conclusion

According to the current review, several marine chemicals might be quite effective against SARS-CoV-2. Certain marine compounds can be a better choice as compared to chemically manufactured medicines for the treatment of severe COVID-19. Marine resources are also cost-effective due to their large quantity and variety. The advancements in bioinformatics techniques, investigations on gene mutations, and multi-omics technologies can provide a potential solution to the current limitations regarding marine drug development. Further research on novel resources derived from the sea might produce promising therapeutics for COVID-19 patients.

Limitations

Marine drug development faces certain obstacles. A major concern is that, despite the fact that the sea is home to many species, they are not easily accessible. A steady supply of chemicals is required to continue preclinical and clinical studies and further development of the drugs.",,[]
phycocyanin,phycocyanin,"Buoys placed in Lake Erie, act as floating laboratories","CLEVELAND — Four high-tech buoys acting as floating laboratories are placed in central Lake Erie each May to collect data, monitor water quality and much more.

What You Need To Know Four smart buoys monitor water quality in central Lake Erie as part of the Smart Lake Erie Watershed Initiative



It’s a collaborative project from Cleveland Water Alliance, Cleveland Water, and Limnotech



The buoys help give the water department advance notice of potential water quality issues and much more



Other industries such as fishing and boating use the public data from the buoys ​

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 11 million people depend on Lake Erie for drinking water, including about 3 million people in Ohio and about 1.4 million in Cleveland.

Scott Moegling, the water quality manager for Cleveland Water, looks forward to the day each year when the four smart buoys are placed in central Lake Erie to collect data on water conditions.

“They're expensive, but they're worth it. We've learned a lot of good information, and a better understanding of Lake Erie and and water quality in the water that we treat,"" Moegling said. ""If you'd have told me 30 years ago that I'd be looking at satellite imagery and using remote laboratories out in the lake to help me treat water, I probably would have laughed and said no way, but here we are.”

The buoys are deployed by environmental scientists from Limnotech, the water science and engineering firm which engineers the buoys. The first buoy deployed in 2010, then the next came in 2016 and two more last year.

“This one is going to go out three-and-a-half miles. We've got one that's 12 miles out they're putting out right now,"" he said. ""We'll have another one over at Nottingham, it'll be about three-and-a-half miles and then one over at our Crown Water Plant over off of Westlake, that one will be about three miles offshore.”

The buoys’ gathered information is sent to an online monitoring system 24 hours a day where it is viewed by Cleveland Water staff and the public. The buoys help give the water department hours of advanced notice of a water quality issue long before the water is drawn into a treatment plant.

“By getting that extra lead time, we can not only gear up manpower, we can gear up chemicals, we can anticipate needed changes,” Moegling said. “We can increase testing and be more vigilant when we know that something may be coming at us.”

The sensors on the buoys track a variety of things including temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, phycocyanin, which is a blue-green algae pigment, chlorophyll, which is an algae pigment, and other things that the water department can use to identify water quality parameters they need for treatment.

The data isn’t just useful to the water department. Many other industries like fishing and boating benefit. Moegling said the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and the Coast Guard use the buoys' data.

“The fishing industry, they'll use our dissolved oxygen data and to identify where to go fish, you know, if there's a low oxygen then the fish won't be there,” Moegling said. “Boaters use it, the wave height, wave period, the wind speed and directions are important for boaters.”

In 2021, Cleveland Water Alliance (CWA), Cleveland Water, and LimnoTech activated the Smart Lake Erie Watershed, an award-winning regional smart water monitoring network. It's the first of it's kind in the nation and is used to inform and improve public health, safety, utility operations, supply chain management, and water security throughout Greater Cleveland. Because of this advanced technology, Lake Erie is one of the most studied and digitally-connected bodies of freshwater on earth. Moegling said other organizations have their own smart buoys deployed on the lake as well for other reasons.

“It’s great that we have this beautiful resource right here for us to use and to enjoy and to recreate on,” Moegling said. “We’re getting a better understanding about the lake itself. Once we understand that, and understand all the complexities of the lake, then we can manage it better.”

The organization asks that people stay at least 100 feet away from the buoys, especially fishermen who are trawling behind their boats.

“Cleveland water has great treatment,” Moegling said. “We put out high quality water that meets all the regulations and then beyond. And we're really proud of the quality of water that we're able to put out.”

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,Spirulina benefits: Effects of spirulina on sport performances,"Spirulina is type of blue-green algae rich in nutrients and antioxidants and it is also one of the most popular nutritional supplements in the world. As a result, spirulina is associated with a number of positive health effects, most notably effects which apply to the area of sport performances.

Here, we take a closer look at how spirulina affects sporting performances.

First of all, spirulina is 55-70 percent protein, which is a percentage significantly larger than those of beef (25 percent protein) and eggs (13 percent). Therefore, this makes spirulina a key source of long-lasting energy for athletes, whilst assisting them with muscle growth and improving stamina.

Given that it is algae, it is also far easier than the likes of lentils, beef and cow's milk to digest, as there is no extra cell membrane to break down. Whilst the net protein use of spirulina is around 52 percent, those of lentils, beef and cow's milk are 30 percent, 15 percent and 12 percent respectively.

Furthermore, spirulina contains a pigment called phycocyanin which gives it its unique blue-green colour. It is a key antioxidant which assists athletes with anti-inflammation. This can be a significant aid to athletes given the amount of physical stress which they endure on a regular basis.

What other health benefits does spirulina bring?

Aside from a strictly sporting perspective, there is evidence that spirulina may have anti-cancer properties and that it may reduce blood pressure.

For example, in a recent study in India involving 87 people with precancerous lesions, among those who took one gram of spirulina per day for one year 45 percent of these people saw the lesions disappear.

With regards to a reduction in blood pressure, a dose of 4.5 grams per day has been proven to reduce the blood pressure of individuals with normal levels.",,[]
phycocyanin,phycocyanin,This new blue beer is already selling out in France,"Several years back, blue wine was making headlines in France. Now in 2022, it’s blue beer that’s creating a bit of a stir.

Hoppy Urban Brew (aka HUB) — based in the city of Roubaix, not far from the Belgian border — teamed up with a company called Etika Spirulina which grows spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, that is then supplied to the brewery to give the beer its blue hue, according to Reuters. The hope is that the eye-catching drink — which gets its colour from the compound phycocyanin — can also help Etika Spirulina promote its algae as a dietary supplement.

The blue beer is in demand

“It’s getting an enormous amount of interest and curiosity on the part of the public,” Sebastien Verbeke, a brewery employee, told the news outlet. HUB is reportedly already working on ramping up production after 1,500 bottles of the 3-percent ABV brew (which is called Line) sold out over the last three months of 2021.

Despite its blue colour, the beer itself is billed as a session IPA. “It’s quite disconcerting,” HUB’s Mathilde Vanmansart explained while tasting the beer, “because since it’s blue, our brains expect a certain note, but, no, we really have here a session IPA, a very light beer, and the flavours of the beer really come through. We can taste that it has a light alcohol content with quite the taste of hops, with slight notes of citrus. And in the back of the mouth, there’s a slight taste of lychee. It’s quite refreshing.”

Of course, after 40 years of craft beer, seemingly everything has been done before. We’ve seen a blue beer coloured with blue seaweed in Japan, covered a green “algae” beer in Ohio (though it wasn’t actually made with algae) — and, yes, a quick search on Untappd shows that, indeed, breweries have tossed spirulina in beers before to help coax out a blue hue. But when it comes to convincing people to consume algae, every bit helps, right?

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,Predicting Climate Change Driven Toxic Algae Blooms With Intelligent Fluorescence Sensor Technology,"Water resource engineers and managers responsible for the safety of municipal drinking water systems, raw water supply storage projects and busy summer water recreational areas popular for swimming or fishing will find the sophisticated Model EV82 Environmental Sensor Series from Electro Chemical Devices helps them detect rising chlorophyll levels accurately and reliably in their efforts to prevent toxic harmful algae blooms (HABs).

Scientists around the globe who are studying climate change point increasingly to its effects on the quality of the water supply. Drought conditions as well as rising industrial and agricultural activity have been blamed in part for the increasing organic load nutrient levels from fertilizers and other run-off pollutants in surface water that lead to rising seasonal chlorophyll growth levels, which are ripe for full toxic algae blooms causing more environmental damage.

Detecting rising levels of chlorophyll and algae in water samples helps water engineers ensure proper disinfection and effective treatment of surface water to protect municipal drinking water quality. Recent studies, sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies, of the Great Lakes, major rivers and other surface water systems are pointing toward climate change as a potential cause of the rising number of algae bloom problems.

ECD’s field-proven Triton EV82 Sensors measure chlorophyll, algae, phytoplankton, cyanobacteria and other plant matter. These sensors utilize state-of-the-art fluorescence sensing technology that detects chlorophyll levels and come in four unique optical configurations for water quality and environmental applications. Also available is Cyanobacteria Sensors for blue-green algae, which measures phycocyanin for freshwater cyanobacteria or phycoerythrin for marine water cyanobacteria. EV82 sensors are typically used to measure rising or falling trends of the desired measurement parameter chosen and then the sensor is pre-calibrated at the factory.

EV82 Toxic Algae Bloom Sensor

The EV82 Sensors incorporate ECD’s intelligent design, which features built-in digital serial communications. The measurement parameter’s calibration data is stored in the sensor allowing plug-and-play field installation of a pre-calibrated sensor. The EV82 sensors also directly connect to the ECD T80 Universal Transmitter, the ECD LQ800 Multi-Channel Controller or directly with any control system’s programmable logic controller (PLC) via the sensor’s built-in serial communication.

The minimum chlorophyll sensing ranges available are a choice of either 0.03 ug/L (blue excitation method) or 0.3 ug/L (red excitation method). The Model EV82’s rugged, submersible IP-68 rated standard sensor operates at depths of up to 33 feet (10 meters) for maximum flexibility, with greater depths available.

The Model EV82’s easy-to-install sensor features a rugged, secure mounting that is accomplished with the provided pipe thread for a permanent standpipe installation. No special tools or extensive training are required. The sensor operates over a wide temperature range from 32 to 122 °F (0 to 50 °C) for application versatility.

The T80 Transmitter and the LQ800 Multi-Channel Controller are also both simple to install for a full analyzer capability. They feature built-in power supplies that operate over 24 VDC power. Just plug them in and they’re ready to go. Outputs are via Modbus RTU RS485 digital communications, and they also include LCD displays with highly intuitive menus that will appeal to busy technicians.

Maintenance requirements are minimized by the Model EV82 Analyzer’s thoughtful sensor design, which features a smooth parallel optical sensing surface. This design reduces potential algae contamination without the need for extra cleaning maintenance by busy plant technicians. Ease of installation and low maintenance requirements reduce this analyzer’s total installed and lifecycle costs.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,In vitro and in vivo anti-cancer effects of hibernating common carp (Cyprinus carpio) plasma on metastatic triple-negative breast cancer,"Preparation of the fish for hibernation

All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Isfahan (IR.UI.REC.1398.072). Alive adult common carps (mean weight: 1670 ± 240 g, mean length: 34.4 ± 7.9 cm) were purchased from a local fish farm in Isfahan provenance, Iran. They were placed in a 200-L plastic tank with circulating aerated water (Temperature: 20 °C, Flow rate: 500 L/h, Dissolved oxygen: > 5 mg/L) for one month. After acclimation period, the fish were randomly divided into two groups including non-hibernating and hibernating. Non-hibernating fish were kept in the same containers and conditions (Temperature: 20 °C). The hibernation protocol was done according to previous studies13,26,50. The fish were induced into a hibernated state by gradient cooling of water at the rate of 1–2 °C until 3 °C in water tanks located in a temperature-controlled cold room and maintained at this temperature during the winter. Then, we separately put the fish of each groups in a water tank containing eugenol (4-allyl-2 methoxy phenol, the active component of clove oil, 40 mg/L) to anesthetize them. Anesthesia of fish is characterized by the complete loss of balance, immobility, and failure to respond to strong external stimuli, such as intense touch and vibration of the tail area51. The fish were anesthetized by eugenol (40 mg/L) and blood was collected from the caudal vasculature. Subsequently, plasma was isolated, separately pooled together for each group, lyophilized and stored at -80° C for further use.

Cell culture

The murine triple-negative mammary cancer (4T1) and normal murine fibroblast (L929) cell lines were obtained from the Pasteur Institute (Tehran, Iran). 4T1 and L929 cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at standard cell culture condition (37 °C, 5% CO2).

MTT assay

The cell viability of 4T1 and L929 cells was evaluated using MTT (3-(4 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Briefly, cells were allowed to grow to 80% confluency. The cells were detached using 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution (GIBCO, USA) and seeded in 96-well culture plates at density of 5 × 103 cells/well. After 24 h incubation, different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 mg/ml) of lyophilized plasma of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp dissolved in culture medium were added to each wells. After 24, 48, and 72 h of cells seeding in 96 -well plate, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then media were replaced with a basal culture medium containing 0.005% MTT solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). After 4 h incubation (37 °C, 5% CO2) in the dark, the medium was discarded and the precipitated formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Finally, the absorbance of each well was detected by an Absorbance Microplate Reader (BioTek-ELX800, USA) at the wavelength of 570 nm. According to the following equation, the percentage of cell viability was calculated by relative value to the untreated cells (0 mg/ml) as the control group. The experiment was repeated three times and at least six wells were used for each concentration.

$$ Cell \,Viablity\, \left( \% \right) = \frac{{\left( {OD \,Sample - OD \,Blank} \right)}}{{\left( {OD \,Control - OD \,Blank} \right)}} \times {1}00 $$

Morphological assessment

4T1 and L929 cells were separately seeded in 6-well culture plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h. Then, the wells were washed three times with PBS (Sigma, USA). An inverted phase-contrast light microscope (Olympus, Japan) was used to capture photographs before treatment. Then, the wells were divided into three groups including control, hibernating plasma, and non-hibernating plasma. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group, while the cells of hibernating plasma group were treated with the optimal hibernating plasma concentration selected from the MTT assay (16 mg/ml). The same concentration of non-hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) was used to treat the cells of hibernating plasma group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. After 24 h, the wells were washed three times with PBS and microscopic photographs were captured to evaluate changes in cellular morphology.

Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining assay

The dual-fluorescent AO/EB staining assay was used to evaluate the cell viability as well as apoptosis. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with the optimal hibernating and non-hibernating plasma concentration (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. Then, the wells were washed three times with PBS and stained with 100 µl AO/EB mixture solution containing 100 µg/ml acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 100 µg/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in PBS for 30 min in the dark. Finally, an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan) was used to capture images.

Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) staining assay

Apoptosis rate was determined by the apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences, USA) according to previous study52. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a concentration of 1 × 105 and incubated overnight. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 16 mg/ml hibernating plasma or the same concentration of non-hibernating plasma for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. The cells were detached and washed three times with cold PBS (1X, pH 7.4) and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min. Then, the cells were resuspended in binding buffer (100 µl), stained with 5 µl of Annexin V-FITC and the same volume of PI, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Subsequently, the volume of each sample was increased to 500 μl by adding binding buffer and the cells were immediately analyzed (104 cells/sample) using flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, USA). This experiment was independently repeated three times and the obtained data were analyzed by the FlowJo-V10 software.

Cell cycle analysis

The Tali™ cell cycle kit (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, USA) was performed to determine the percentage of cells at each stage of the cell cycle. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 and incubated overnight. Subsequently, the cells were treated with hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) or non-hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. After that, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice with cold PBS. Then, they were fixed with dropwise addition of 70% ice-cold ethanol (1 ml) while gentle vortexing and stored at -20 °C overnight. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min. Then, the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of Tali™ cell cycle solution. Finally, it was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The DNA content of stained cells was analyzed using flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, USA) for each sample. This experiment was independently repeated three times and the results were displayed as histograms. The obtained data were analyzed by the FlowJo-V10 software.

Wound healing assay

The wound healing (or scratch) assay was carried out for cell migration analysis. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates and incubated for 48 h to grow to 80% confluency. Then, the cell layer was scratched by a sterile P200 Micropipette tip. The wells were washed twice with PBS to remove the debris and smoothing the edges of the scratch. Next, the cells were incubated with RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.5% FBS and treated with the optimal hibernating or non-hibernating plasma concentration (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. The photographs were obtained from the selected regions using an inverted phase-contrast light microscope (Olympus, Japan) at 0 h (immediately after media replacement) and 24 h after treatment with hibernating and non-hibernating plasma. The Wound Healing Size Tool, as an ImageJ/Fiji1 plugin, was used to quantifying the wound area53. The following equation was used to calculate the wound closure percentage.

$$ Wound\; closure\, \% = \left. {\left( {\frac{Initial\; wound\; area - Final\; wound\; area }{{Initail\; wound\; area}}} \right.} \right) \times 100 $$

Cancer cells implantation and tumor challenge

All animal experiments and procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Isfahan (IR.UI.REC.1398.072). A total of 54 female Balb/c mice (mean weight: 23 ± 2 g) were purchased from the Royan Institute of Isfahan, Iran. The mice were housed in standard cages with controlled temperature (24 ± 2 ºC), relative humidity (50 ± 10%), 12-h light–dark cycle, and ad libitum access to enough food and water. It should be mentioned that standardized humane endpoints based on the current guidelines for endpoints in animal tumor studies were used54,55,56. After two weeks of acclimation, the mice's belly hair was shaved and disinfected with 70% alcohol. 1.5 × 106 4T1 cells suspended in 50 µl of basal culture medium were subcutaneously injected into the fourth left mammary fat pad of each mouse. When the tumor size reached 50–70 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into three groups including control, hibernating plasma, and non-hibernating plasma. The control group of mice was intratumorally injected with PBS (200 µl), while the other groups were respectively treated with intratumoral (i.t) injection of hibernating plasma (200 µl, 16 mg/ml) and non-hibernating plasma (200 µl, 16 mg/ml) once every day for 18 days. For tumor growth analysis, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor volume was calculated using the following equation.

$$ Tumor\; volume = \frac{{\left( {Tumor\; length} \right) \times \left( {Tumor\; width} \right)^{2} }}{2} $$

The greatest longitudinal diameter (length) and the greatest transverse diameter (width) of tumors were measured by a digital caliper (Neiko, USA) every three days. Besides, the body weights of tumor-bearing mice were measured. For survival analysis, 24 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 8). The tumor-bearing mice were closely monitored for 60 days after tumor implantation. The animals’ death was recorded every day. The failure to eat and drink for over 3 days and a lack of limb movement were considered as the standardized humane endpoint used to euthanize animals by an overdose of ketamine/xylazine solution.

Metastasis analysis

Metastasis is the main cause of death for cancer patients57,58. For metastasis analysis, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor implantation and treatment approaches were as described in the previous section. The mice were sacrificed by overdose of ketamine/xylazine and their liver and lungs were harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution 40 days after cancer cell implantation. An automatic tissue processor (Sakura, Japan) was employed to process the fixed samples. Then, a microtome (Leica Biosystems, Germany) was utilized to cut 4 µm thickness serial sections from the paraffin-embedded blocks. The sections were stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining protocol for subsequent histological evaluation59. A minimum of 10 random microscopic fields was observed under the 10 × objective lens of a light microscope (Olympus, Japan) to report the mean number of metastatic colonies per microscopic field of the liver. Furthermore, the occupied area by metastatic colonies in each microscopic field of the liver (magnification × 100) was quantified by the Qupath software. The mean percentage of occupied space by liver metastatic colonies in each microscopic field was reported for each sample. Besides, all over the H&E stained sections of lungs were analyzed for counting metastatic colonies.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical staining of the proliferation marker Ki-67 was carried out to evaluate the anti-proliferative effect of hibernating plasma on 4T1 breast tumors. This biomarker is commonly used in the clinic for identifying the prognosis and effectiveness of treatment in patients60,61. For the analysis of Ki-67, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor implantation and treatment approaches were as described in the previous section. The mice were sacrificed with the overdose of ketamine/xylazine solution after 18 days and the tumors were harvested. After 24 h fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin, the specimens were processed by an automatic tissue processor (Sakura, Japan), followed by routine methods for subsequent histological evaluation. The sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti-Ki-67 antibody (Biolegend, USA) at 4 °C overnight. The sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG followed by incubation with streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (HRP). After three times wash, the sections were incubated with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) tetrahydrochloride and followed by a counterstain with hematoxylin62. The photographs of slides were taken by using a digital light microscope (Olympus, Japan), and the percentage of tumor cells that were positive for the Ki-67 as a proliferation biomarker was quantified using ImageJ software63.

Analysis of plasma proteins by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS)

Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate–Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out to analyze the plasma proteins of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp. Firstly, 1 mg of the lyophilized plasma of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp was separately dissolved in 1 ml PBS buffer. Protein concentration of the lyophilized plasma was determined using a microplate reader (BioTek-Synergy HT, USA). Then, 15 µl of dissolved lyophilized plasma was mixed with 5 µl of sample loadings buffer for SDS-PAGE (1X; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. After that, 20 µl of this solution was loaded into each well of the gel (12% SDS-PAGE). The gels were electrophoresed at 70 V for 30 min and then at 130 V for 1.5 h using a SDS gel running buffer. The molecular weight marker of the protein (ranging from 5–232 KDa) included Insulin (5 KDa), Ribonuclease A (13 KDa), Chymotrypsinogen A (25 KDa), Ovalbumin (43 KDa), Bovin Serum Albumin (67 KDa), Aldolase (158 KDa), Catalase (232 KDa) was loaded in a lane next to the plasma samples. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 45 min at 25 °C after electrophoresis. Hot water and a shaker (IKA-Werke, Germany) were used to decolorize the gel. Finally, the gels were imaged using a Bio-5000 Plus gel imaging scanner (Zhongjing Microtek, Shanghai, China), and the density of protein bands was measured by Image J Software. The 158 KDa band cut off from the gel and send for the high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS) analysis performed by Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC-Micromass Quattro micro API Mass Spectrometer.

Statistical analysis

The data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc tests were used to evaluate the significance of the difference between groups, by employing the JMP 14.0 software (SAS Institute, Japan). The difference was considered statistically significant if P < 0.05. (*: P < 0.05, ns: not significant). The Kaplan–Meier curves were drawn and analyzed by JMP software, using the Log-Rank test to assess the significant differences between the mean survival time of tumor-bearing mice in different groups.

Ethical approval

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,Why This Blue Beer Has Major Health Benefits,"Unlike the green beer swilled by the masses on St. Patrick's Day, which uses green food dye, Line's bluish tint is caused by the pigment phycocyanin found in the blue-green algae known as spirulina, according to Food & Wine. Like its green counterpart, the blue color doesn't impact the beer's flavor in any discernible way. It is made in the style of a session IPA, producing notes of citrus and a slight hoppiness.

Since it contains spirulina, the beer provides a number of potential health benefits, and clocking in at a modest 3% ABV (Alcohol by Volume), you're unlikely to get inebriated if you indulge in one or two. This particular type of algae, which is available in dietary supplements, is packed with protein and rich in vitamins, according to Medical News Today. A series of studies published through the National Library of Medicine have indicated that spirulina also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help strengthen the immune system.

Blue-green algae is often labeled a superfood as well, although this is not a medical or scientific term and can sometimes be associated with product marketing hype. Regardless, spirulina is nutrient-dense and low in calories, so ""To your health"" just might prove a fitting toast for those raising a glass of this quirky blue beer.",,['Colin Mccandless']
phycocyanin,phycocyanin,Algenist Launches Blue Algae Vitamin C Skinclarity Brightening Serum,"The unique form of vitamin C is said to help visibly restore skin clarity and improve skin texture in 10 days.

Algenist has launched the Blue Algae Vitamin C Skinclarity Brightening Serum, featuring its Blue Algae Vitamin C, an L-ascorbic acid made from regenerative spirulina blue-green algae.

The unique form of vitamin C is said to help visibly restore skin clarity and improve skin texture in 10 days.

Skinclarity Brightening Serum is also formulated with Algenist's patented Alguronic Acid to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles; a marine ferment to help improve the appearance of skin texture and hydrate skin; a moisturizing complex that combines hyaluronic acid and Alguronic Acid to help provide a clinically measured increase in skin hydration; and tansy extract to help condition and soothe skin.

The vegan product is said to target the appearance of pigmentation, appearing most prominently in the fair and deep complexions as dark spots, uneven tone and texture, and overall dullness.

The serum retails for $72 at the brand's site and at Sephora.

Tammy Yaiser, VP product development, said: ""The team was inspired by the extensive research on blue-green algae, and for the potential to derive, extract and isolate its naturally-occurring vitamin C component and then to regeneratively produce it in a lab. The spirulina is sustainably grown, and the naturally-occurring vitamin C component is isolated and concentrated. The result is a highly pure ascorbic acid raw material, identified simply on the ingredient list as 'ascorbic acid.' What's also exciting about the process is that the leftover algae by-product is still rich in nutrients and can be beneficial for other applications such as fermentation, agricultural fertilizers and wastewater remediation. A part of the leftover biomass is used for making spirulina extract and spirulina oil. We considered the whole process.""

CEO Rose Fernandez, said: ""When we set out to solve a problem in 10 days with each of our formulas, the process is rigorous. If an ingredient or technology does not exist to help deliver on our promise of 10-day results, or if we see a way to re-envision traditional methods ingredients are made to elevate our commitment to high-performance, naturally-sourced and more sustainably-produced ingredients—we will make our own. This is how the brand was born and proudly continues today. Today we have consumers searching for vitamin C at high rates. This inspired us to develop a naturally-derived, potent vitamin C from a bold, blue spirulina. In our scientific study, our new Blue Algae Vitamin C outperformed other commonly used forms of vitamin C and other brightening ingredients specifically used for targeting pigmentation that we tested. No surprise given our reputation. This coupled with the fact that there was an opportunity to develop a new vitamin C serum actually clinically studied on melanin-rich skin—who can experience skin sensitivity, blotchiness or even products that simply don't work.""

phycocyanin,phycocyanin,I Tried Kourtney Kardashian’s Viral Breakfast and I’m Mad About How Good It Is,"This article originally appeared on Vegetarian Times

Now that Kourtney Kardashian has transitioned from famous-because-she's-rich person to professional wellness guru thanks to her website, Poosh, the 42-year-old's workout routines, beauty regime, and, recipes have become the subject of intense internet scrutiny. Perhaps none more so than the TikTok-viral avocado pudding.

After sharing a cup of the pale green pudding with Addison Rae in a YouTube video, the goop Kardashian claims she's eaten for breakfast every day for the past five years took off on its own trajectory - earning a mixed bag of fevered admiration and outright disgust. ""I wish everyone understood how good this is,"" Rae proclaimed, seemingly earnestly in the clip. But not everyone who tried the recipe had such a favorable opinion.

TikToker @myhealthydish said ""it tasted like baby food."" In another video, @eitan calls it ""mutant ninja jelly,"" and, in what is perhaps my favorite review, @tandisss says it looks and tastes like ""it came out of Shrek's asshole.""

The original recipe feels a bit extra (and not even entirely vegetarian). In addition to avocado, milk (any kind, but Kourt uses her homemade macadamia milk, of course), and sweetener, it calls for ingredients like MCT Oil, vanilla bone broth protein powder, and BrainOn (""a Refractance WindowTM dried, concentrated organic E3AFA (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) extract of Phycocyanin and Phenylethylamine (PEA)""), none of which I happened to have on hand. Fortunately, a simplified version, sans supplements, exists.

I was fully prepared to hate Kourt's avocado pudding-smoothie. I was already distraught about potentially wasting an avocado to try it, but try it I did, for you, reader, and what I discovered shocked me to my core.

Story continues

It's kind of...good? Kourtney Kardashian and Addison Rae were...right???

My first attempt was as close to the original as possible -- one avocado, one can of coconut milk, and a big spoonful of Makuna honey (Kourt's preferred variety). Straight out of the blender, I found it to be creamy, a little sweet, and actually quite pleasant. I could imagine how lovely it would be right after a grueling workout, if grueling workouts were my kind of thing.

But I didn't stop there. After watching 100 TikTok videos of people riffing on this recipe, I had a few hunches about potential enhancements. So, I put the blender pitcher back on its base and added a banana, a cup of ice cubes, and a big squeeze of lime juice, and the result was, hand to god, delicious. I was so surprised, I was almost mad.

Avocado desserts are nothing new, and you probably won't be surprised to learn that Kardashian did not, in fact, invent them. She credits her child Reign’s Brazilian nanny for introducing her to the idea, which she modified to fit her lifestyle. In Brazil, something similar to this known as Creme de Abacate, and as many TikTokers point out, there's also Sinh To Bo, a refreshing Vietnamese drink that combines avocado, ice, and condensed, sweetened milk.

Inspired by TikTok user @nicole_thenomad, I decided to further gild the lily, turning my avocado pudding concoction into a smoothie bowl situation, with mango, fresh berries, and homemade granola, and maybe this is a breakfast I'll eat again? Maybe even every day for five years, I'm not sure! I'm not sure about anything anymore...

phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,Taiyo wows at Vitafoods with special product prototypes,"Taiyo, the expert in health-promoting natural ingredients, introduced innovative concepts that generated great interest among visitors to Vitafoods Europe in Geneva.

The focus was on Taiyo's water-soluble ingredients such as Sunfiber, SunActive Mg and combination products like SunCurcumin. Additionally, Taiyo presented a blue Sunfiber, which consists of a combination with phycocyanin from the spirulina algae.

Other popular new products included power shot concepts based on prebiotic juice powders with Sunfiber, which were eagerly tasted by attendees, as well as prototypes of matcha pralines and Taiyo’s elderberry-based ElderMune gummies.

Taiyo presented more than 40 new product concepts at Vitafoods, based on seven different raw materials, including Guar bean fiber (PHGG), matcha, and elderberry. Highlights at the booth were its water-soluble ingredients – a range of Sunfiber blends with various additional health benefits, like blue Sunfiber: It consists of a combination from Sunfiber and the spirulina algae, which contains a lot of protein and is said to slow down ageing processes, and also strengthen the immune system .[1]​ Moringa Extract S, a standardised leaf powder with 10% glucomoringin, which has anti-inflammatory properties, also generated great interest. Whether presented as a capsule or tablet, visitors were excited by the variety of options available.

Another special offer at the Taiyo stand was vegan bolognese, made with Vegemeat, a granulated pea protein that is free from soy, gluten, additives and preservatives, and has a convincing, minced meat-like texture. It is particularly suitable for making dishes such as meat-free bolognese or lasagna and therfore appeals to the consumer group who follow a vegan or low-meat diet, or suffer from intolerances and therefore closely study ingredient lists. Thanks to the gentle manufacturing process, Vegemeat convinces with a low acrylamide value and is thus superior to many other legume-based meat alternatives.

Dr Stefan Siebrecht, Managing Director of Taiyo's German subsidiary, says: ""The trend towards organic products was really noticeable at the show. As consumers are increasingly questioning a product's ingredients and wanting natural and plant-based alternatives, manufacturers of end products are on the search for suitable solutions.""​

Another trend evident at Vitafoods was growing interest in functional confectionery. Delicious gummies with added health benefits, for example, are becoming increasingly popular among consumers. They can be easily adapted to the different needs of various consumer groups and are available as a healthy alternative to conventional fruit gums.

Taiyo has quickly responded to this trend and showcased its ElderMune gummies, which contain elderbery juice powder plus Sunfiber. These small berries positively impact immune health because they are rich in vitamins C and B, and contain essential oils and minerals. So-called anthocyanins – secondary plant substances – are not only responsible for the berry´s rich black-blue color but also protect the body's cells from free radicals. Heart and blood pressure also benefit from advantageous elderberries as they have anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects. They therefore provide a great alternative to cranberries in combating cystitis and kidney disease, and help thoroughly flush the excretory organs.[2]​

phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,Start-up ‘beats the blues’ with spirulina-based food colouring for hot and cold beverages,"The colour blue is rare in nature, and as such, the pigment has been highly sought after – in textiles and paints alike – for millennia.

An ‘eye-catching’ and ‘exciting’ colour, blue has also proved an attractive hue for food and beverage makers. In the drinks category, well-known blue drinks range from blue lagoon cocktails to berry-flavoured soft drinks, blue lattes and functional sports beverages.

As the clean label trend continues apace, consumers are increasingly looking to avoid artificial synthetic colorants. But in the blue category, whether synthetic or natural, Israeli start-up Gavan says both face the same problem.

“Both synthetic blue dyes and plant-based blue colouring have regulatory, stability, intensity, or price challenges,” ​explained Yael Leader, head of product for Gavan.

“The main barrier to creating food formulations with natural colours is stability – the ability to overcome formulation challenges and ensure vibrant and consistent true blue throughout the product’s shelf life.” ​

While delivering a health-stable, naturally derived, vibrant blue for products with low pH is ‘tricky’, as any heat treatment or shift in pH can influence the colour’s shade, Gavan believes it has found the solution in spirulina.

Phycocyanin pigment-protein​

A type of blue-green algae, spirulina contains a pigment-protein known as phycocyanin, which produces a pure blue colour.

Gavan’s proprietary, non-GMO technology extracts phycocyanin and optomises the colourant ‘gently, without damaging the source, and enables the extraction of multiple compounds from the whole spirulina, without waste.

The result is a stable, blue colourant developed from technology that protects it from fading, event at pH as low as 3.0 or when pasteurised at 90°C for 30 seconds, noted the start-up.

“In addition, the platform’s control over particle size offers improved stability throughout the final product’s shelf life.” ​

Fortified drink potential​

Gavan says its platform allows for a ‘full spectrum’ of stable shades of blue, but as blue is a primary colour, it also ‘opens a window’ to producing other colours, from non-chlorophyll green to purple shades.

The start-up’s natural colouring formulation can be used for hot beverages, such as tea and coffee, as well as functional drinks and sports drinks.

“We have experienced quite a hearty demand from companies who are saying their consumers are looking for new experiences They have expressed a desire to widen their colour palates and are becoming more adventurous,” ​Itai Cohen, CEO and co-founder of Gavan, told FoodNavigator.

“This has spurred a growing demand for natural colours, whether blue or green, primarily for categories like functional beverages such as sports drinks and energy drinks and even cocktails.” ​

However, within the functional beverage category, when a large amount of vitamins and minerals can be added, ingredients can react with pigments and accelerate the colour degradation process.

This can cause fading, or create a complex binding of pigments and minerals that can deposit sedimentation in the final application, we were told.

Gavan’s platform provides a solution for the fortified beverages sector, amongst others.

From a clean label perspective, the colourant is marked as ‘spirulina extract’ on ingredients lists. “It complies with FDA-21 CFR US code of federal regulation code title 21,” ​said Cohen.

“The colouring principle complies with section 75.530 spirulina extract.” ​",,['Flora Southey']
phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,Wild blue wonder: X-ray beam explores food color protein,"In food products, the natural blues tend to be moody.

A fun food colorant with a scientific name – phycocyanin – provides a vivid blue pigment that food companies crave, but it can be unstable when placed in soft drinks and sport beverages, and then lose its hues under fluorescent light on grocery shelves.

With the help of physics and the bright X-ray beams from Cornell’s synchrotron, Cornell food scientists have found the recipe for phycocyanin’s unique behavior and they now have a chance to stabilize it, according to new research published Nov. 12 in the American Chemical Society’s journal BioMacromolecules.

“Phycocyanin has a vibrant blue color,” said Alireza Abbaspourrad, the Youngkeun Joh Assistant Professor of Food Chemistry and Ingredient Technology in the Department of Food Science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “However, if you want to put phycocyanin into acidified beverages, the blue color fades quickly due to thermal treatment.”

The research, “Tuning C-Phycocyanin Photoactivity via pH-Mediated Assembly–Disassembly,” was authored by Ying Li, a doctoral student in food science; Richard Gillilan, staff scientist at the Macromolecular X-ray science at the Cornell High

Energy Synchrotron Source, or MacCHESS ; and Abbaspourrad.

Most food companies seeking blues in their food use synthetic food dye, Abbaspourrad said. Phycocyanin is a natural and more nutritional protein derived from algae, which is the main ingredient in spirulina, mostly sold in powder form at health food stores. The food scientists wanted to understand its color properties and how it worked.

Food science, meet physics. The researchers partnered with the Macromolecular Diffraction Facility of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) and used Size-Exclusion Chromatography coupled to Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SEC−SAXS) on a beamline.

Phycocyanin was placed into a biological fluid and brought to the MacCHESS laboratory. There, intense beamline X-rays were channeled into tiny drops of the fluid. The small-angle X-ray scattering showed that as pH levels, the molecular strands changed into different shapes, folds and assemblies.

“So as pH changes, the phycocyanin molecules form in different ways,” Li said. “If the pH goes up, the molecules come together and if the pH level goes down, the molecules disassemble.

“As we changed the environmental stimulus for the phycocyanin, the molecules modulate their behavior in terms of how they interact with light,” she said. “It's a relationship of the protein structure and the color stability.”

The acidity of the environment can essentially mediate an assembly-disassembly pathway, Abbaspourrad said. “Through the X-ray scattering we could see the proteins and see how their monomers are assembled together and how the oligomers disassemble,” he said. “That’s the root cause for how the blue color fades.”

This research was funded by U.S. Department of Agriculture (National Institute of Food and Agriculture), and CHESS is supported by the National Science Foundation, New York state, and the National Institutes of Health and its National Institute of General Medical Sciences.",,['Blaine Friedlander']
phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,"Spirulina: Uses, Benefits, Side Effects, Dosage, Precautions","Spirulina is a blue-green algae from the genus Arthrospira (""arthro"" roughly meaning ""joint,"" and ""spira"" meaning ""spiral""). It's been used by the Aztecs in Mexico and people living in the Lake Chad area in Africa for centuries. Spirulina's usually cultivated from bodies of water like lakes or farmed in ponds.

Spirulina contains several nutrients, including fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, and K), fatty acids (DHA, EPA), beta carotene and minerals. It's also a source of protein, but it lacks high enough levels of some of the amino acids that your body needs to function at its best (unless you have a medical condition where you need to avoid specific amino acids, like phenylketonuria or ""PKU""). Since spirulina comes from bacteria (specifically ""cyanobacteria""), it may be considered a protein source for vegans.

It's also important to note that the B12 in spirulina is in a different form as ""pseudovitamin B12"" than the type typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs, especially if you follow a vegetarian or vegan way of eating, which can be low in B12. Lower levels of B12 are also found in adults over the age of 60. And why's B12 important? Because your body needs B12 to make red blood cells, it's also crucial for brain and nerve cell development. Not getting enough B12 can cause tiredness, memory loss, depression, and even different types of anemia.

This article takes a closer look at the potential uses of spirulina and the risks associated with its use.

Dietary supplements are not regulated in the United States, meaning the FDA does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement that has been tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn’t mean that they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about any potential interactions with other supplements or medications.

Uses of Spirulina

Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare provider, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD/RDN), or pharmacist. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease.



Spirulina has fat-soluble vitamins (like A, E, and K), beta carotene and minerals, protein, and phycocyanins (pigments that produce a blue color and have shown antioxidant effects). Phycocyanins have been used as a dye in many industries, including pharmacy, culinary, and even cosmetics.

Scientists have studied, but not necessarily proven, spirulina's impact on different areas of health, including but not limited to:

We'll explore what the science says about spirulina's effectiveness for these health outcomes.



Antioxidant capacity

According to a meta-analysis (a collection of research studies) of nine studies with a total of 415 people, spirulina increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The studies used anywhere from one to eight grams of spirulina per day, a pretty extensive range. Many of the studies had a relatively small number of people, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much. The strength of the effects was not earth-shattering and was generally more substantial when people took five grams of spirulina per day or more.

The conclusion? Getting antioxidants from the foods that we eat can help reduce some of the inflammation in our bodies. To amp up antioxidants in your diet, try including a variety of the most nutrient-dense foods that you can source and afford - and they don't have to be organic - like whole grains, fruit, and vegetables to help increase your body's antioxidant capacity and reduce inflammation in your body. Just don't rely on spirulina alone.

Blood pressure

Scientists did a meta-analysis (a collection of several research studies on a topic) of five randomized controlled trials that included 230 people to check spirulina's effects on blood pressure. The people in the different studies took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina a day. The lengths of the studies were anywhere from two to 12 weeks, and many of the studies were pretty small, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much.

When the data was pooled (put together) and analyzed from these studies, the scientists said that spirulina lowered systolic blood pressure by about 4.59 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure 7.02 millimeters of mercury. Systolic pressure (top number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. Diastolic pressure (bottom number) measures the pressure your arteries experience between each heartbeat. The biggest blood pressure-lowering in the studies was seen in people who had high blood pressure already.

The scientists also said more high-quality studies are needed before we can start recommending that everyone with high blood pressure needs to start eating spirulina.

Blood sugar control

Have you ever gotten a jittery feeling after eating sugary food? That usually means your blood sugar's spiking. And this situation can be dire for people coping with conditions like type I or type II diabetes, disordered eating including diabulimia, and more.

Over time, blood sugar spikes that are left uncontrolled can actually lead to damage to your body. Worst case, in certain conditions like diabetes, that can look like having to surgically remove parts of your body (amputation), heart attacks, kidney failure, or stroke, which can lead to paralysis of parts of your body. While spirulina really would not likely be able to correct severe damage from uncontrolled blood sugar over time by itself, it has lowered blood sugar levels in human studies. And why? It could be its protein and fiber content, or perhaps it is phycocyanin's ability to help with inflammation. Scientists are still figuring it out.

Fourteen studies with 510 people with metabolic syndrome–a collection of symptoms like high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (""good cholesterol""), and high waist circumference, which altogether can create more severe health problems–were included in a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on blood sugar and other outcomes. And a lot of those studies didn't have many people in them, meaning they had lower statistical power. People took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina per day. Blood sugar and insulin levels were reduced in some of the studies after taking specific amounts of spirulina. More high-quality studies are needed before healthcare providers can recommend spirulina for lowering blood sugar and insulin levels.

Generally, working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN), particularly a Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist (CDCES), can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. RDs/RDNs can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to avoid spikes in your blood sugar, which could help you feel better. Remember, managing blood sugar can be challenging, and you don't have to do it alone!

Cancer

Unfortunately, very few well-conducted human studies have looked at spirulina's effects on cancer. There've been several studies in test tube cells or in animals that aren't humans. However, more well-constructed studies looking at its effects on humans are needed.



Cholesterol levels

Scientists conducted a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on cholesterol levels that had seven controlled trials for a total of 522 total people. They found that spirulina reduced: total cholesterol (by 46.76 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)), low-density lipoprotein (LDL by 41.32 milligrams per deciliter), and triglycerides (by 44.23 milligrams per deciliter). It also increased the ""good"" cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL by 6.06 milligrams per deciliter). Again, why did spirulina do this? We're not sure, but scientists think it may be due to its nutritional profile (fiber, fatty acids like DHA and EPA), its antioxidant capacity, or a combination of these.



While healthcare providers cannot recommend spirulina for lowering your cholesterol, they can suggest working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) to help you explore your eating patterns, movement, and more. Registered dietitian nutritionists can help you build your toolkit and your capacity. Again, you're not alone!

Liver health

Spirulina has been studied for its effects on liver health in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the study was very small (only 13 people), so we can't draw any conclusions about spirulina for NAFLD until larger and better studies are done.

Metabolic syndrome

Scientists have studied spirulina's effects on metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome happens when you have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist (excess abdominal fat). Metabolic syndrome can wreak havoc with your health and increases your odds of heart attack, stroke, and type two diabetes. One of metabolic syndrome's main causes is thought to be obesity. Obesity, however, can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass.

One spirulina meta-analysis pulled together data from 18 studies. It suggested that spirulina could help lower high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, which are all parts of metabolic syndrome. It's important to note that while spirulina may impact these outcomes, the most essential issue would be working on your current way of eating, your movement (exercise), and other equally important issues like addressing your emotional health. Spirulina can't solve these serious issues.

Consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and perhaps one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. In addition, they can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to help you feel better. Sometimes it can be challenging to give yourself permission to ask for and accept help. But you've got this. And you don't have to go at it alone.

Obesity

In a meta-analysis of five studies, scientists looked at spirulina's effects on weight management in people coping with obesity. Spirulina did decrease weight in people with obesity by 4.55 pounds and in people who were overweight by 2.82 pounds. However, clinically speaking, this is not enough to make a solid recommendation for use of spirulina for obesity treatment.

As mentioned previously, it's important to note that obesity can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass. And BMI does not give the complete picture of an individual's well-being. Consider requesting a body composition test (for example, skin-fold measurements or a DEXA Body Composition scan) from your healthcare provider in addition to other parameters that they may measure.

As mentioned above, consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and, ideally, one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM).

An allergic reaction may be possible in those allergic to spirulina. Allergic reactions would include rash or swelling. Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience side effects and call your healthcare provider.



Common Side Effects

Spirulina is generally safe, but some people have reported the following with its use:

Allergy

Headache

Muscle pain

Sweating

Trouble sleeping



Severe Side Effects

While severe side effects from spirulina are rare, be aware that the following have occurred:

Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

(severe allergic reaction) Throat swelling

Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience severe side effects and call your healthcare provider.

Precautions

People with phenylketonuria (inability to process the amino acid phenylalanine) and individuals with other amino acid disorders, for example, classical homocystinuria (HCU), or maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), may need to avoid spirulina due to its high protein and thus amino acid content.



The safety of spirulina in pregnant or nursing people has not been established. Speak with your healthcare provider before using spirulina if you're pregnant, plan to get pregnant or if you're breastfeeding.

Please don't give children supplements–including spirulina–without discussing this with their pediatrician first.

Spirulina can sometimes be contaminated with things like lead or other heavy metals (it grows in lakes, after all) or even toxins.



Dosage: How Much Spirulina Should I Take?

Always speak with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement to ensure that the supplement and dosage are appropriate for your individual needs.



Manufacturer recommendations might vary. As a general guideline though, don't use more than what's listed on your product's label. There's no recommended ""effective"" dosage of spirulina. Avoid spirulina if you're allergic or sensitive to it or any of its ingredients. Studies have used from one to 10 grams a day for up to six months to 19 grams of spirulina a day for up two months, with a relatively good safety profile in people with different conditions.



Again, please do not give supplements to children without first discussing this with their pediatrician.

What Happens If I Take Too Much Spirulina?

An upper limit or recommended intake is lacking for spirulina. Taking upwards of 40 grams per day for an unknown period of time has been noted. If you believe that you've taken too much spirulina, contact your healthcare provider for information.



Interactions

Blood thinners: While there are only about 0.26 micrograms of vitamin K in each gram of spirulina, taking far larger amounts could theoretically impact the blood-thinning effects of some medicines like Jantoven (warfarin).

Immunomodulators: Little evidence exists to support avoiding the use of spirulina with immunosuppressive drugs or drugs that change the way that the immune system works (immunomodulators).

It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included. Please review this supplement label with your healthcare provider to discuss any potential interactions with foods, other supplements, and medications.



How to Store Spirulina

Store spirulina in a cool, dry place. Keep spirulina away from direct sunlight. Discard as indicated by the ""use by"" date on the packaging. Keep away from children and pets.



Similar Supplements

Chlorella (a green algae supplement) is somewhat similar to spirulina.

Frequently Asked Questions Is spirulina the same as chlorella? No, chlorella and spirulina are different species of algae, but they're both supplements.

What antioxidants does spirulina have? Spirulina has phycocyanins.

If I'm a vegan, can I get all my protein and B12 needs from spirulina? While spirulina has most of the amino acids that your body needs, it doesn't have enough of some of them. Try to eat a balanced, varied diet to meet your unique protein needs. The B12 in spirulina–pseudovitamin B12–is in a different form than the type that's typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs.

Sources of Spirulina & What to Look For

Blue-green algae species used in spirulina supplements are typically Spirulina maxima, Spirulina platensis, or Aphanizomenon flos-aquae.



Just because a remedy is thought to be ""natural"" does not mean that it is safe. Some ""wild-crafted"" spirulina products may have been grown in water contaminated with heavy metals (mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium) or other pollutants. Opt for supplements produced in labs and certified by third-party authorities like the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF International.



As with all supplements, it's essential to talk with your healthcare provider before using spirulina to decide if it's right for you.



Spirulina Supplements

This article was previously published April 8, 2019, and has been updated with new information.

In 2018, James DiNicolantonio, co-author of my book, “Superfuel,” published a groundbreaking paper,1 “Antioxidant Bilirubin Works in Multiple Ways to Reduce Risk for Obesity and Its Health Complications.”

Bilirubin is a breakdown product of red blood cells (heme) and the chemical responsible for the yellow color of bruises, urine and jaundice.

In that paper, DiNicolantonio explains how bilirubin inhibits NADPH oxidase (typically abbreviated as NOX) — a metabolic enzyme activated in a large number of pathological conditions that generates a great deal of oxidative stress — and how phycocyanobilin found in spirulina can exert similar effects.

The reason for this is because the phycocyanobilin found in spirulina is rapidly reduced to phycocyanorubin, a close homolog of bilirubin, in mammalian cells.2,3 In a follow-up paper4 published March 2019, DiNicolantonio, et.al, propose that elevated bilirubin might aid weight control by preventing the development of leptin resistance, and discuss evidence suggesting spirulina may be an effective way to combat leptin resistance as well.

Bilirubin Can Play a Role in Chronic Disease

When a newborn baby gets jaundice, he is placed under “bili lights” in the hospital nursery to prevent brain damage (kernicterus), should his bilirubin levels become too high. The blue lights break down the bilirubin so it can be excreted. However, at appropriate levels, bilirubin has a strong free radial scavenging effect.

Until recently, scientists were unaware that bilirubin may actually have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and atheroprotective properties, and there is a growing body of scientific and clinical evidence to support this.

From an evolutionary/biological perspective, it also makes sense that nature would have created a way for your body to break down heme,5 which can be toxic if it accumulates. The way bilirubin is thought to provide these health benefits is through its ability to inhibit NOX.

In fact, NOX overactivity appears to play a significant role in a wide range of health conditions, including but not limited to vascular diseases and vascular complications of other diseases (diabetes, kidney failure, blindness and heart disease, for example), insulin resistance, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, cancer, glaucoma, pulmonary fibrosis and erectile dysfunction.

It follows then that preventing many chronic diseases would require finding a means of inhibiting or modulating NOX. Bilirubin is believed to assist with this modulating effect.

People with Gilbert Syndrome comprise 3 to 7% of the population6,7 and illustrate this phenomenon quite nicely, as they are genetically predisposed to chronically elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin.

These individuals, having two to three times as much bilirubin as the rest of us after a 24-hour fast,8 enjoy a greatly reduced risk for coronary artery disease, hypertension, carotid atherosclerosis and overall mortality, and this protection is thought to be related to their high bilirubin levels.9

Spirulina — An Effective NADPH Oxidase Inhibitor

Since phycocyanobilin is a very close relative of bilirubin — and spirulina is a great source of phycocyanobilin — spirulina has enormous clinical potential due to its NOX inhibiting effect. This is why phycocyanobilin has been the focus of a large amount of research.

Phycobilin extracts have been shown to inhibit NOX activity in human aortic endothelium, aortic smooth muscle and renal cell cultures. And bilirubin protects against diabetic nephropathy via downregulation of NOX in rats.

As DiNicolantonio’s 2018 paper10 explains, bilirubin reduces the risk for obesity and related health problems through a number of mechanisms, but primarily by inhibiting NOX complexes.

Downregulating NOX activity — which can be done with spirulina, thanks to its bilirubin-mimicking phycocyanobilin — could therefore have “profound implications for preservation of metabolic and vascular health.” As further explained by the authors:

“Expression of inducible form of heme oxygenase, HO-1, can be boosted by oxidative stress — often derived from NADPH oxidase [NOX] activity; the resultant production of bilirubin feeds back to quell this oxidative stress …

[Phycocyanobilin, which is covalently attached to phycocyanin] is readily converted by biliverdin reductase to the bilirubin analogue phycocyanorubin, which appears to share bilirubin’s ability to inhibit NADPH oxidase [NOX] complexes. Arguably, this may largely explain the versatile antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of oral spirulina … in rodent studies …

A recent cross-sectional epidemiological study evaluating subjects with [Gilbert Syndrome] has discovered that [Gilbert Syndrome] is associated with a reduced tendency to gain body fat in later life … A reasonable deduction is that chronically elevated free unconjugated bilirubin — and perhaps an upregulation in intracellular bilirubin generation — somehow opposes age-related gain in body fat.

Of related interest is a study showing that intraperitoneal administration of bilirubin — administered daily for 14 days — inhibits weight gain in rats fed a diet high in fats and sugar. Bilirubin injections were also found to prevent deterioration of glucose tolerance …

A credible case can be made that the favorable impact of elevated bilirubin on risk for undesirable weight gain reflects preservation of hypothalamic leptin sensitivity …

Activation of NADPH oxidase [NOX] is a key mediator of proinflammatory microglial activation; hence, elevated bilirubin might be expected to support effective leptin function in the arcuate nucleus, thereby aiding appetite control.

Oxidative stress in adipocytes, stemming largely from NADPH oxidase [NOX] activity, appears to play a key role in the induction of insulin resistance and the skewing of adipokine and cytokine production in hypertrophied adipocytes.

Hence, bilirubin and heme oxygenase activity could be expected to aid maintenance of adipocyte insulin sensitivity. Indeed, plasma levels of unconjugated bilirubin have been found to correlate inversely with risk for metabolic syndrome and diabetes in prospective epidemiological studies, as confirmed in a recent meta-analysis.

In both cross-sectional and prospective studies, higher plasma bilirubin levels are associated with better insulin sensitivity and decreased risk for metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes — independent of BMI … A direct protective effect of bilirubin on adipocyte function may be largely responsible for this phenomenon.”

Leptin Resistance: A Hallmark of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes

In order for you to significantly gain weight, you must first become leptin resistant. Leptin is a hormone that helps you regulate your appetite. When your leptin levels rise, it signals your body that you’re full, so you’ll stop eating.

However, as you become increasingly resistant to the effects of leptin, you end up eating more. The question then is: what drives this basic process? Why do you become leptin resistant in the first place?

Research by Dr. Richard Johnson — head of nephrology at the University of Colorado who has published more than 500 medical papers and written a number of books on obesity — clearly shows that refined sugar (in particular fructose) is exceptionally effective at causing leptin resistance in animals and blocks the burning of fat.

Most overweight Americans have some degree of insulin and leptin resistance. This also includes people with diabetes, and many individuals with high blood pressure or high cholesterol. If you fall into this category, it would be prudent for you to restrict fructose to about 15 to 25 grams per day from all sources.

In his most recent paper,11 DiNicolantonio and his co-authors hypothesize that spirulina supplementation may also be an effective treatment for leptin resistance.

Bilirubin Protects Against Weight Gain

As mentioned earlier, people with Gilbert Syndrome are genetically predisposed to chronically elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin. This not only appears to protect them from heart disease and overall mortality, but also prevents body fat accumulation, especially during later years, and hypothalamic leptin resistance is one known condition that promotes weight gain as you grow older.12

Research has shown that leptin injections have no effect on obesity. “Studies in rodents with diet-induced obesity suggest that this phenomenon reflects a loss of leptin responsiveness that is specific to the arcuate nucleus,” DiNicolantonio notes.13

Research also suggests that diet-induced obesity is related to the activation of microglia (glial cells that function as scavengers) in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH).14 Again, NOX plays an important role. Activation of microglia also leads to the production of toxic oxidants such as peroxynitrite and other proinflammatory cytokines.

As noted by DiNicolantonio, “Hence, it is straightforward to propose that bilirubin may have the ability to downregulate microglial activation by diminishing NADPH oxidase activation.” That said, bilirubin does not appear to be able to influence leptin activity until or unless leptin resistance has actually developed.

Spirulina May Combat Leptin Resistance by Mimicking Bilirubin

Now, while raising your bilirubin level could potentially protect you from obesity and diabetes, it’s not a useful nutraceutical in and of itself, and this is where spirulina comes in, as the phycocyanobilin found in spirulina is very similar to bilirubin. DiNicolantonio sums it up as follows:15

“If the hypothesis presented here is correct, the far lower body fat in older subjects with Gilbert Syndrome reflects the ability of bilirubin to suppress the activation and proliferation of microglia in the MBH.

The extent to which this expansion of activated microglia — and the associated impact on the function of leptin-responsive neurons — can be reversed by elevation of bilirubin (or administration of phycocyanobilin) in patients who have already developed obesity with leptin resistance remains to be seen.

Particularly because microglial mass increases, it may be rash to assume that this syndrome is fully reversible. If phycocyanobilin does prove to have utility for controlling hypothalamic inflammation, its greatest impact on obesity will likely be achieved by long-term administration in a preventive mode.

In any case, studies evaluating the impact of bilirubin or phycocyanobilin administration on the development of hypothalamic leptin resistance in fat-fed rodents appear to be warranted … Two studies have been published very recently in which inclusion of spirulina in the diet has been shown to inhibit gain in body weight and fat in rats fed a high-fat diet; these appear to be the first studies to have evaluated spirulina’s impact in this regard.

Although neither of these studies focused on leptin function, the fact that markers of adipose tissue browning were higher in rats receiving spirulina is consistent with effective leptin function in these rats.

Moreover, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial has also emerged, in which spirulina supplementation (at only 2 grams daily) was found to potentiate loss of body fat, body weight, waist circumference and BMI in overweight subjects placed on a calorie-restricted diet; reductions in triglycerides and C reactive protein were also greater in the spirulina group.

Bilirubin mimesis [imitation or mimicry] may represent one example of a more general strategy for preventing or reversing inappropriate weight gain: counteracting hypothalamic leptin resistance or upregulating hypothalamic leptin signaling.”

Spirulina Types, Dosing and Potential Adverse Reactions

There are many types of spirulina on the market, so do your homework before making a purchase. Since spirulina grown in an uncontrolled environment has the potential to become contaminated with heavy metals and other toxins, it is important to choose organic spirulina from a reputable source.

Spirulina comes in capsules, tablets, powders and flakes. Dosing depends on what you plan to use it for and to whom it is given. A general starting dose for adults is typically around 3 grams. For disease prevention, you may work your way up to 20 grams per day. The adult maintenance dose is typically around 10 grams a day.

Remember to increase your intake of spring water or filtered water when taking spirulina to help it absorb into your system. Also be aware that spirulina is a potent detoxifier, so depending on your toxic burden, you may or may not experience a detox reaction. For that reason, it is best to start with a small dose and work your way up.

Though there are no known side effects associated with spirulina, your body may react to it based on your current state of health. Some of the most prominent reactions you may experience include:

Slight fever — The high protein content in spirulina increases metabolism, which may elevate body temperature Dark green stool — Spirulina can remove accumulated waste products in your colon, which may cause darker stool. Also, spirulina is high in chlorophyll, which turns your stool green Gas — Buildup of gas may indicate that your digestive system is not functioning properly Excitability — Your body is converting protein into heat energy, which may cause temporary feelings of restlessness Breakouts and/or itchy skin — This is caused by the colon cleansing process and is a temporary reaction Sleepiness — This is caused by the detoxification process and may indicate your body is exhausted and needs more rest

Also keep in mind that while spirulina is entirely natural and generally considered a healthy food, there are some important contraindications you need to be aware of. Avoid spirulina if you are:16

Severely allergic to seafood

Allergic to iodine

Pregnant

Nursing

If you have hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), consult your health care provider before taking spirulina. Also avoid taking spirulina if you are currently running a fever, as it may raise it further. Also, do not take spirulina if you have an autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, or if you a metabolic condition called phenylketonuria (PKU).

Chlorella — An Alternative if You Can’t Tolerate Spirulina

Chlorella is another form of algae that is sometimes confused with spirulina. The fundamental difference between spirulina and chlorella is that spirulina does not possess the hard cell wall that makes chlorella closer to a plant than algae. Note, however, that chlorella does not have the phycocyanobilin so it will not inhibit NOX and increase NADPH.

Chlorella is an excellent way to detoxify your body from mercury, a common problem if you have amalgam dental fillings, have received a thimerosal-containing vaccine or regularly eat contaminated fish. It is also one of nature’s highest source of chlorophyll, which has many biological benefits.

Spirulina is unable to remove heavy metals, as it lacks a cell membrane. It can, however, protect your liver against the toxic effects of heavy metals, and help eliminate other toxins, including arsenic. If for whatever reason you cannot tolerate spirulina, chlorella could be a viable alternative to obtain some of its benefits described above.

Who fancies some blue food? Really?

The theory of food colour confusion may originate from us being strongly aroused by foods on the red spectrum. Research published in Nature recently showed that we are more attracted to red coloured foods as they appear to signal better nutrition with higher calories in comparison to blue or green foods. Trichromatic vision evolved in humans as a response to improve foraging and may explain why we rely more on sight than scent when locating the most nutritious foods and fruits that are ripe and ready to eat. This is surprising to us as ‘leafy green’ farmers when we readily assume a green colour relates to health but the Nature study was more assigned to calorific colour arousal. Although our brains may not easily accept the blue colour as natural, our bodies will probably thank us if we do as blue-green algae also known as cyanobacteria has some of the best health benefits. Superfoods: Yogurt with blue Spirulina, Scottish Damsens, Blueberries and Sloes.

One particular cyanobacteria has been studied extensively over the years

Spirulina grows naturally in alkaline waters and was recognised and farmed by ancient civilisations for its medicinal qualities. The Aztecs of Mexico have a long historical relationship with Spirulina. They farmed Spirulina in large lakes, then harvested and air dried the algae to form a hard edible ‘cake’. This was often mixed with other foods and used as an energy source as these ancient people recognised it as an important functional food.

Massive health benefits that many people have still to discover

People who move beyond the colour tend to use blue-green algae for supercharging the immune system, controlling muscle spasms, detoxing heavy metals, eliminating candida, improving memory and increasing energy levels to improve exercise performance. It may also lower cholesterol and blood sugar, acting to prevent heart disease, heal wounds and improve digestion. Pretty impressive qualities for this single celled life form billions of years old.

There are two main species of the blue green algae Spirulina, Arthrospira platensis and Arthrospira maxima. As the image demonstrates, they are made up of single cells containing chlorophyll filled vesicles that react to light and photosynthesize like plants. Cultivation of commercial algae usually starts the life cycle in lab culture tubes, doubling quickly under controlled conditions. This helps to eliminate contaminants. Spirulina is the largest single celled blue green algae and it forms spirals visible to the human eye which bunch together to allow a quick harvest and is now cultivated worldwide as a nutritional supplement.

Spirulina is high in iron, calcium, magnesium, copper, beta-carotene and B-vitamins.

Apart from the high content of protein, Spirulina contains B vitamins, particularly B12 and provitamin A (β-carotenes), and minerals, especially iron. It is also rich in phenolic acids, tocopherols and γ-linolenic acid. Spirulina does not have a cellulose cell wall so it is more easily digested. Most people selling dried Spirulina suggest 1-8g per day to boost the immune system but be careful as too much can have negative effects so it’s best to start with the lowest dose.

Some suggest Spirulina has the power to tackle world wide problems like malnutrition. The UN and WHO recommend Spirulina for it’s extremely high nutritional value and sustainability. It has even been called the ‘world’s most sustainable food’ with the potential to end world hunger. The Pole Pole Foundation in the Congo were finalists in the Earthshot Prize recently. They are leading the way to teach communities in developing countries how to grow Spirulina as a supplement to prevent childhood malnutrition.

Could Spirulina be an alternative vegan protein source?

Would you drink blue milk? Many vegans are looking for alternative sources of protein. Spirulina might even be a protein source of the future and a substitute for cow’s milk. Spirulina platensis stands out for being one of the richest protein sources of microbial origin having similar protein levels when compared to meat and soybeans. Not to be confused with regular green Spirulina in its basic form, blue Spirulina is an extract of the active ingredient phycocyanin in its purest form. This concentrates the dried extract with higher levels of antioxidants without so much of the fishy taste of fresh Spirulina. But if you don’t mind using fresh Spirulina (it’s fishy so it’s much better to mix with stronger flavours) it will provide protein that is quickly and easily absorbed in the body compared to animal proteins which is a bonus as it contains many essential amino acids that the body cannot synthesize alone and are essential for tissue renewal.

Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory

Fresh Spirulina is high in antioxidants, especially phycocyanin, the pigment which causes the blue green colour. Phycocyanin can promote blood cell regeneration, improve lymphocyte activity and improve the lymphatic system. Studies have shown this antioxidant scavenges and fights the free radicals that cause oxidative damage.

Spirulina is known to be alkalizing to the body which boosts beneficial microflora in the gut. Liver function is improved and this greatly increases detoxification levels in the body. Fresh Spirulina contains chlorophyll and phycocyanin both of which help to remove toxins such as heavy metals and other pollutants from the blood. One remarkable study in children who lived close to Chernobyl after the nuclear disaster in 1986 found that giving them a small 5g dose of Spirulina a day could reduce radionuclide rates by half in less than two months.

Spirulina has Cancer fighting benefits

Spirulina has been hailed as an anticancer superfood, but reading further into peer reviewed literature is important as there are some extrapolated and conflicting reports from doing a simple google search. So here we only present peer reviewed data. From our research low dose Spirulina has anti-proliferation effects on stomach cancer cells, human leukaemia cells and B lymphoma cells, inhibiting carcinogenesis.

Eating Spirulina daily may lead to increased energy levels

Fresh Spirulina is particularly good for energy owing to its high nutrient density. Since the algae has no cell wall to break down, digestion of all those nutrients is fast and efficient. It can make a difference to energy levels quickly after consumption. Fresh Spirulina contains constituents such as polysaccharides (Rhamnose and Glycogen) and essential fats that are absorbed easily by cells and theoretically aid energy release. More studies are needed to be truly conclusive though but with low toxicity levels in the body, it’s well worth your own trials.

Spirulina enhances energy performance because it unlocks sugar from our cells. If you are suffering from memory loss, this bacteria added daily to your routine appears to have significant effects. It does this by protecting the brain from free-radical damage by increasing the activity of two enzymes: catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which fight free radicals and make the brain more resistant to aging.

But It’s not all good news

Spirulina may exacerbate autoimmune reactions in some people who are susceptible. As such it may worsen symptoms of multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions linked to overactive immune systems. It’s also not recommended for pregnant women or children or people on blood thinners like warfarin. Be cautious where you purchase Spirulina, as it may be contaminated if not bought from a quality source, leading to additional side effects.

Bioavailability: Should it be dried or is live culture better?

Image credit: Ecoduna, Austria If you search for Spirulina online you are mainly going to encounter powdered products. There is nothing wrong with these as most research was conducted on using powdered forms which still showed positive results. However some reports suggest fresh Spirulina has up to 95% bioavailability. This means that 95% of the nutrients including essential amino acids, all the B vitamins and antioxidants are absorbed straight into your bloodstream increasing potency by 45% compared with powder.

How difficult is it to cultivate and commercialize?

Spirulina cultivation requires sufficient aeration, agitation and proper light intensity for enhanced biomass yield, cell productivity, specific growth rate and protein content. Biomass yield has the potential to reach up to 12g/l biomass in a closed reactor system. Urea seems to be a promising alternative source of low-cost nitrogen for Spirulina cultures and addition of mechanised aeration will significantly increase yields. Spirulina vats in a hothouse, Mexico

But what about algal blooms? Are they the same Cyanobacteria?

Spirulina itself is non toxic but other forms of blue green algae including Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, grown and harvested in the wild, is often contaminated and leads to toxic conditions when out of control.

Blue-green algae occurs naturally in lochs, ponds, reservoirs, rivers and the sea. This summer in Scotland it became a real issue. When the conditions are right, blue green algae will create massive blooms so large they can be captured by satellite imaging from space. Blooms are accelerated by leaching of fertilisers, with nitrogen and phosphorus runoff into the water course which becomes detrimental to other life forms by blocking oxygen and releasing toxic microcystins.

So it’s a logical step to grow these in a controlled environment and if market conditions continue to accelerate consumer demand for functional foods then growing these super algae in CEA could be highly profitable for farmers.

Image credit: Earthrise The largest US producer of Spirulina is based in California and they produce on an open 108 acre site, exporting to over 20 countries worldwide. There are disadvantages of open ponds as they do not reach high biomass productivity due to the difficulty of maintaining the optimum temperature and so they are restricted to tropical and subtropical regions. This is mitigated to some extent with large paddles constantly moving the ponds.

Despite this hefty competition, CEA could be the perfect vehicle for growing a crop that has incredible health properties, sequesters CO2 and can be grown in tubing to eliminate contamination. With LED lights and agitation, enhanced yields could be harvested year round.

This could be particularly useful between the shoulder winter months to increase profits and farm skills where wholesale prices have the potential to return profits of up to $15/Kg . A rough estimate of 12g/L biomass can be achieved with a photobioreactor system incorporating PPFD 166 μmol photons m−2 s−1 with potential doubling every 2-6 days depending on the algal species chosen. Based on this, and assuming you harvest 50% at each doubling time, a microfarm running 100L tanks could harvest 0.6Kg every 2 days, giving a total annual yield of 106.2Kg and a potential maximum annual return of $1593. Scaling up production will make more economic sense. Optimizing and automating additional technology (LED lighting, CO2 enhancement and state of the art infrastructure as seen with Algaennovation) may boost production but this must be carefully managed to balance a return on investment.

Learning and applying new ideas – food, fuel & carbon trap

Image courtesy of Energy Futures living laboratory project, Lille France We like to get people talking about the future diversity of CEA. This helps drive innovation and creates wider jobs and skills. At the same time we aim to help you better understand the science and health prospects of plants that could be grown in CEA. Of all the ideas out there, maybe our favourite is the idea of an algae curtain. Glow in the dark tubes of algae obscure prying eyes from your space while producing your own superfood or fuel. Could plants literally fuel plants in a completely carbon neutral circular economy? Biodiesel produced using algae contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and highly biodegradable. This could have potential in offsetting CEA energy outputs and algae fuel cells could make home farms more economically sustainable in the future. There are so many applications for algae, some are even using it to extract CO2 from brewing. Whatever reason you have for growing Spirulina and others (chlorella) there is no doubt about this being classed as a superfood.

Closer to home we like the way CEA farmers are looking to diversify their product range and kudos to On the Grow farms in Rockwall, Texas, growing spirulina alongside their microgreens. They grow in demijohn bottles adjusting the salinity to 2 and pH 10.5-11, harvesting and topping up fresh water every day. In order to maintain high pH and avoid fluctuations, high amounts of sodium bicarbonate must always be included in the culture medium to buffer the solution. The water needs aeration and temperature needs to be tightly regulated to 80F. LED lights will speed up production and your farm will literally bloom. Image credit: On The Grow Farms, Texas

Spirulina first rose to fame as a potential space food. Maybe in space our brains are altered by gravity to be more accepting of blue food. Or maybe we will discover a whole new superfood bacterial species on Mars or deep in the ocean. So who’s got a spare shelf in their vertical farm for this blue superfood and space age protein milk shake? Janet Colston PhD is pharmacologist with an interest in growing ‘functional’ foods that have additional phytonutrients and display medicinal qualities that are beneficial to human health. She grows these using a range of techniques including plant tissue micropropagation and controlled environmental agriculture to ensure the highest quality control.

Phycocyanin pigments are vital for multiple industries, having various important commercial applications. Producing them from gas and oil wastewater presents a sustainable waste valorization process that fits the aims of the circular economy concept.

Phycocyanin

Phycocyanin, along with allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin, is a pigment-protein complex. It is a water-soluble light-harvesting phycobiliprotein with a characteristic light blue color and is an accessory pigment to chlorophyll. Phycocyanins are produced by cyanobacteria.

There are numerous commercial and scientific uses of phycocyanin. It is used as a natural food coloring, in nutritional supplements (for example, spirulina,) as a coloring in cosmetics, and as fluorescent markers in immunological assays. It is also used in animal feeds and aquaculture. Additionally, it contains anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and antiviral properties, making it an attractive target for therapeutics and drugs within the biomedical industry.

Using Petrochemical Wastewater for Microalgae Culture

The petrochemical industries produce large volumes of wastewater globally as a result of oil and gas extraction. Over 90% is re-injected into formations or disposal wells for recovery. Treatment ponds are used to store most of the remaining wastewater. If disposed of untreated into the environment, wastewater can cause significant levels of pollution, affecting vulnerable ecosystems.

Using produced wastewater for the cultivation of algae is a huge opportunity for the valorization of waste streams in the oil and gas industries. This can be used for nutrient recovery, with the biomass used for beneficial purposes. A 2017 study has found that whilst produced wastewater has high salinity and organic compounds that are detrimental for algae growth, important inorganic nutrients which microbes use for growth are present, which is advantageous. Produced wastewater can therefore be used as a culture medium.

Additionally, there are indications that using produced wastewater for microalgal cultivation can be used for biofuel production as well as microbial wastewater treatment. Another recent study has demonstrated the possibility of utilizing microalgal cultivation for nutrient removal.

The majority of current investigations into using produced wastewater as a microalgae cultivation medium have focused on using microalgal biofilms for biofuel production. Conversely, there is limited research into the production of valuable bioproducts. Integrating side streams of valuable bioproducts into processes using microalgal biorefineries could help reduce the costs associated with microalgal wastewater treatment and biofuel production.

The recovery of phycobiliproteins such as phycocyanin and their derivative products can be easily integrated into microalgae biorefinery operations, and the water solubility of phycobiliproteins means that they do not interfere with the recovery of denser liquids. Thus, integrating them into these operations can optimize operations and add value to them.

Suitable substrates for microalgae biofilm growth have been identified in the current literature, with over 15 different materials so far explored. Cotton-based materials have been identified as the best-performing options.

The Study

The main purpose of the new study published online in Frontiers in Energy Research is to evaluate the influence of growth materials and light intensity in a rotating algae biofilm reactor on phycocyanin production. LLC2, a strain of cyanobacteria, was chosen for its ability to form biofilms in different light and substrate conditions. High levels of turbidity and good solid biomass production were identified as key factors in the choice of the reactor for the study.

The team constructed a 2000-liter outdoor-produced water pond at Utah State University. The pool was operated between August and September due to favorable outdoor temperature and the pond was shaded to control light intensity. Out of the materials tested for biofilm growth substratum, the cotton rope was identified as the best option.

Amongst the experimental observations in the study, low light LLC2 biofilms produced twice the amount of phycocyanin per biomass yield compared to high light biofilms. An accompanying crude extract purity (just above the benchmark standard for food-grade phycocyanin) was observed. The authors concluded that different production goals could be achieved by adjusting the light level for biofilm culture.

Based on their experimental observations, the authors have stated that future studies should concentrate on producing other high-value products from microalgae cultures in produced wastewater. Additionally, amongst other future research directions suggested in the study, the potential value of cyanobacteria biofilms to produce valuable bioproducts such as fertilizer, feed, biofuels, and biogas should be assessed in studies.

phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,French Brewer Uses Algae to Make Blue Beer,"A French beer-making business, or brewery, is using a special kind of bacteria to turn their beer blue.

The beer, sold under the name Line, is an alcoholic drink made by the Hoppy Urban Brew brewery. The brewery was looking for a way to make its drinks different from other kinds of beer. So, the beer maker partnered with Etika Spirulina. It is a business in northern France that wants to popularize its spirulina algae as a dietary aid.

Sebastien Verbeke works at Hoppy Urban Brew. He told Reuters that the beer is selling well. ""It's getting an enormous amount of interest and curiosity on the part of the public,"" he said.

The part of the spirulina that gives the beer its blue color is called phycocyanin. It is added to the beer during the beer-making process.

Brewery worker Mathilde Vanmansart described the taste of the beer as hoppy, light, and a little fruity. She added that the only evidence of the added algae was the blue color.

Xavier Delannoy owns the farm that provides the spirulina. He said after several tests, the brewery had found a mixture that pleased buyers.

He said 1,500 bottles of the blue beer were sold between October and December last year. The brewery is now preparing to increase its production to meet demand.

The study began with the characterization of wastewater, and solid wastes, where all the wastes analyzed viz., aqua discharge (AD), poultry litter (PL), and cow dung (CD) were found to be enriched with total organic carbon (TOC). AD also displayed a considerable presence of nitrate with a comparatively lower amount of nitrite, orthophosphate, and ammonium. In contrast, for the solid wastes (PL and CD), ammonium and orthophosphate were much more prevalent than nitrate and nitrite. Additionally, the lower dissolved oxygen (DO) and considerable chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biological oxygen demand (BOD) values of AD indicated the presence of organic load in the samples (Tables 1 and 2).

Biomass and total carbohydrate estimation of A. variabilis cultivated in AD medium compared to control BG-11 medium

Time-course studies were conducted to compare the biomass and total carbohydrate production of A. variabilis in control (BG-11 medium) and AD medium (Fig. 2). In this regard, the maximum biomass yield obtained using AD medium (0.45 g L−1) was fairly lower than that of the control (0.58 g L−1) (Fig. 2a). However, the total carbohydrate content displayed a ~ 20% higher value in the AD medium (58.0% dcw) compared to control (46.5% dcw) (Fig. 2b). This increased content obtained using the AD medium compensated for the reduced biomass yield, thus, not compromising with the volumetric production (mg L−1) of total carbohydrate. As a result, the total carbohydrate yield was comparable in both the cultivation media with respective values of 269.7 mg L−1 and 261.0 mg L−1 in control and AD medium (Fig. 2c). In contrast to control, where the maximum value for biomass and total carbohydrate was recorded on the 24th day, the incubation period was reduced to 21st day for cultures grown in the AD medium.

Biomass and total carbohydrate estimation of A. variabilis cultivated in different concentrations of PL and CD

Comparative analysis for biomass yield of A. variabilis cultivated in different concentrations of PL and CD are depicted in Fig. 3a–d, respectively. In order to have a better representation, two concentrations were considered at a time, each for PL and CD, and compared to the BG-11 control. An increasing trend was observed in the biomass production by augmenting the PL level up to 10 g L−1, whereas with CD extract, the maximum value was obtained at 15 g L−1 concentration, above which a declining pattern was observed. However, PL was found to stimulate the growth of A. variabilis more effectively than CD. The biomass yield attained its paramount value (0.90 g L−1) in the PL concentration of 10 g L−1 compared to 0.58 g L−1 in control (BG-11 medium), representing a 35.5% rise (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the biomass yield reached a maximum of 0.84 g L−1 using the CD concentration of 15 g L−1, demonstrating a 30.9% higher value than the control (Fig. 3d). For all the studied concentrations, A. variabilis displayed the peak value on day 24 of its incubation.

Figure 3 Time-course analysis of biomass yield (g L−1) of A. variabilis cultivated in different concentrations of PL: (a) 5 g L−1, 10 g L−1 (b) 15 g L−1, 20 g L−1 and CD: (c) 5 g L−1, 10 g L−1 (d) 15 g L−1, 20 g L−1 compared to control BG-11 medium. Full size image

Similarly, PL concentration of 10 g L−1 also resulted in the highest total carbohydrate content of 57.4% dcw with respect to 46.4% dcw obtained in the control BG-11 medium. Consequently, its yield was boosted to 516.6 mg L−1, representing a 47.9% higher value than the control (269.1 mg L−1) (Table 3). In contrast, for CD, the maximum total carbohydrate content of 52.3% dcw was recorded using 15 g L−1 concentration. At this concentration, the total carbohydrate yield reached 439.3 mg L−1, showing a 38.7% rise compared to control (Table 3).

Studies with combination of wastewater with solid wastes

Biomass and total carbohydrate estimation of A. variabilis cultivated in wastewater supplemented with different concentrations of PL and CD

The individual studies with solid wastes conducted so far involved cultivating the test cyanobacterium in PL and CD extract prepared with millipore water. To further economize the process, subsequent analyses were made in a medium prepared by supplementing these solid wastes in wastewater (AD). AD supplemented with 7.5 g L−1 PL was found to be the most suitable combination resulting in the highest biomass yield of 0.85 g L−1. Augmenting the level of PL in the AD medium to 10 g L−1 marked its de-escalation to 0.77 g L−1 (Table 4). For CD supplemented conditions, the combination of AD with 10 g L−1 CD was best amongst all, resulting in biomass produce of 0.78 g L−1 (Table 4). However, PL supplementation once again had a more dominating effect on A. variabilis, generating higher biomass yield at a comparatively lower concentration (7.5 g L−1). The biomass yield using the said combination (AD + 7.5 g L−1 PL) represented a 31.8% rise compared to the BG-11 control, which was also 47.1% higher than the un-supplemented AD medium.

Table 4 Maximum biomass and total carbohydrate production of A. variabilis in AD supplemented with different concentrations of PL and CD, compared to control (BG-11) and un-supplemented AD. Full size table

The carbohydrate production of the test cyanobacterium was also found to be maximum in AD supplemented with 7.5 g L−1 PL. The total carbohydrate content of 58.4% dcw and yield of 496.4 mg L−1 obtained using this combination was again highest in comparison to all the other PL supplemented conditions (Table 4). These values were also higher than the CD supplemented AD medium, where the maximum total carbohydrate content (53.4% dcw) and yield (416.5 mg L−1) were obtained at a concentration of 10 g L−1 (Table 4). Hence, using AD in combination with 7.5 g L−1 PL, a respective rise of 20.5% and 45.8% in total carbohydrate content and yield was recorded with respect to the control BG-11 medium. Although, compared to the un-supplemented AD medium, the cellular carbohydrate content did not show much variation, the rise in its volumetric yield was by 47.6%. Therefore, for the economical production of large volume bioethanol, the combination of AD with 7.5 g L−1 PL was chosen for further study. This medium was termed as ‘APL.’

Characterization of APL medium

The obtained APL medium was also characterized for the presence of orthophosphate, ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite, TOC, DO, COD, BOD and pH which are depicted in Table 5.

Table 5 Characteristics of APL medium. Full size table

Bioremediation efficiency of A. variabilis grown in APL medium

Inoculation of the APL medium with A. variabilis revealed 100% removal of orthophosphate within 30 days; and nitrate and nitrite within 20 and 15 days of incubation, respectively. While the concentration of ammonium was reduced to 19.2 mg L−1 from an initial value of 74.2 mg L−1, TOC content showed a drop from 91.3 mg L−1 to 17.8 mg L−1 in 35 days of incubation. In other words, cultivation of the test cyanobacterium in the APL medium brought about a respective 74.1% and 80.5% depletion in its ammonium and TOC concentration. COD and BOD were also reduced to 16.6 mg L−1 and 7.3 mg L−1 at the end of 35 days compared to 161.3 mg L−1 and 73.2 mg L−1, respectively, on day zero. Concurrently, an increase in the DO up to 6.8 mg L−1 was observed after the completion of 35 days of incubation (from 4.1 mg L−1 noted initially). The maximum pH of 7.3 was recorded on the 25th day of incubation (Table 6).

Table 6 Concentration changes in APL medium after inoculation with A. variabilis. Full size table

Individual production of bioethanol and co-products from A. variabilis grown in APL medium

As already observed in Table 4, AD + 7.5 g L−1 PL induced the maximum carbohydrate accumulation in A. variabilis. The carbohydrate obtained from the test cyanobacterium grown in APL medium was also predominated by higher yields of fermentable components such as reducing sugar and glycogen (Supplementary Figure S1). Consequently, an elevated volumetric production of bioethanol was obtained using the APL medium. Compared to 118.4 mg L−1 in BG-11 control, the bioethanol yield obtained from APL-grown A. variabilis showed a rise to 219.9 mg L−1, signifying a 46.2% higher value. Nevertheless, for both the conditions (control and APL), the bioethanol conversion % was found to range between 44 and 44.3% (Table 7).

Table 7 Bioethanol production in control (BG-11) and APL medium along with the conversion efficiencies. Full size table

APL medium also served effectively for significant accumulation of all the co-products (Table 8). Using this medium, C-PC content was increased to 5.4% dcw from 3.0% dcw in BG-11 control. On the other hand, PHB and SCC contents were respectively enhanced to 8.3% and 0.07% dcw in the APL medium compared to 6.1% and 0.04% dcw in control. A marginal increase was also witnessed in the EPS content from 39.2% (control) to 43.6% dcw (APL medium). This upsurge in the cellular concentration of the co-products alongside the augmented biomass yield of A. variabilis in the APL medium also heightened their volumetric production. A ~ 61–62% increase was noted for SCC and C-PC yield, recording respective values of 0.59 mg L−1 and 45.9 mg L−1 in the APL medium compared to 0.23 mg L−1 and 17.4 mg L−1 in BG-11 control. Likewise, the yield of PHB and EPS were also elevated to 70.6 mg L−1 and 370.6 mg L−1 from 35.4 mg L−1 and 227.4 mg L−1 in control, indicating a respective ~ 50% and ~ 39% rise (Table 8).

Table 8 Co-products obtained individually from A. variabilis grown in the BG-11 control and APL medium, expressed as content (% dcw) and yield (mg L−1). Full size table

Bioethanol and the co-products harnessed from A. variabilis and their validation using different confirmatory analyses have been summarized in Fig. 4, the comprehensive illustration of which has been provided in Supplementary Figures S2–S7.

Figure 4 Production and confirmatory analyses of (a) Bioethanol, (b) C-PC, (c) PHB, (d) SCC, and (e) EPS from A. variabilis. Full size image

Bioethanol was obtained after fermentation of the pretreated hydrolysate and harvested by phase separation (Fig. 4a) using Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP). The bioethanol production was confirmed using GC–MS analysis, where its presence was detected at the retention time of 1.68 min (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figure S2), referring to the NIST mass spectral library.

C-phycocyanin (C-PC) was extracted as water-soluble blue color pigment and stored as freeze-dried powder (Fig. 4b). The confirmatory detection of C-PC was based on the spectrophotometric determination of the distinct peak at 620 nm, the absorption maxima of C-PC (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Figure S3).

Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) was extracted as white polymer, and its accumulation in A. variabilis was detected using GC analysis (Fig. 4c). The polymer sample obtained from the test cyanobacterium conformed to the standard PHB exhibiting the specific peak at the retention time of 4.5 min, hence, confirming PHB synthesis by A. variabilis (Supplementary Figure S4).

Chlorophyll extracted from A. variabilis was converted into its water-soluble derivative- sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC), which appeared as blue-black powder (Fig. 4d). The identification of SCC was performed using two confirmatory tests (copper test and flame test) to validate the presence of copper in it. In copper test, the formation of a brown-colored complex of copper diethyldithiocarbamate after addition of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate confirmed the presence of copper in the produced SCC sample. In flame test, the SSC sample solution burnt with a green-colored flame, hence, reconfirming the presence of copper in it (Fig. 4d). Additionally, the absorption spectrum of the produced SCC sample was also found to be similar to the standard SCC, showing peaks at the wavelengths of 405 nm and 635 nm (Supplementary Figure S5). This analogy in absorbance behavior again validated the SCC formation in the present study.

Exopolysaccharides (EPS) extracted from the test cyanobacterium when freeze-dried appeared as white cottony fiber (Fig. 4e). HPLC analysis revealed the obtained EPS to be constituted of pentoses like ribose and xylose; and hexoses, such as mannose, glucose, and galactose (Supplementary Figure S6), demonstrating the characteristic feature of cyanobacterial EPS29. The identification of these constituent sugars was performed by comparing their elution time with that of the standards (Supplementary Figure S7a–e).

Cyanobacterial refinery

After having established the suitability of APL medium in stimulating the individual yields of bioethanol and the co-products, it was applied to sequentially extract all the cyanobacterial products from the same harvested biomass. However, the major hindrance faced while executing a step-wise production is the intervention of solvents and extraction processes employed for a particular product on the yield of the others that are to be extracted subsequently. Therefore, in this study, six different sequences were analyzed to screen out the best amongst them that would ensure minimum yield losses (Table 9).

Table 9 Variation in the yield of different products from A. variabilis (equivalent to 1 kg dry biomass) grown in APL medium when placed in different sequential extraction positions. Full size table

Here, the amount of the harnessed products was calculated considering 1 kg dry (≈10 kg wet) biomass of A. variabilis grown in the APL medium. Hence, it becomes mandatory first to mention the yields of each product obtained individually from 1 kg of dry biomass without implementing the sequential extraction strategy. The individual EPS yield was 436.0 g, constituted by 224.5 g RPS and 211.5 g CPS, while the yields for SCC, C-PC, PHB, and carbohydrate were 0.69 g, 54.0 g, 83.1 g, and 584.0 g, respectively. Comparison of all the studied sequences (Table 9) revealed sequence 3 to result in minimum yield loss of all the co-products, comparable to their individual yields. Using this sequence, EPS yield of 430.1 g (222.7 g RPS + 207.4 g CPS), SCC yield of 0.66 g, C-PC yield of 52.9 g, and PHB yield of 79.4 g was obtained. However, compared to individual yield, carbohydrate was compromised in all the sequences, with sequence 3 generating a yield of 369.7 g. This was possibly owing to the prior extraction of CPS (capsular polysaccharides), which accounts for a significant portion of the cell’s total carbohydrate. As a consequence, the anticipated bioethanol yield was likely to be hampered, which is the primary product of the study. Therefore, the carbohydrate and bioethanol production from A. variabilis was also checked under the selected sequence 3 by eliminating the CPS extraction step. Removing this step resulted in notably higher bioethanol production (324.9 mL) comparable to the individual yield obtained from 1 kg dry biomass (329.5 mL). With respect to the sequence integrating CPS extraction, the bioethanol yield using the modified protocol (without CPS) also indicated a 35% rise (Supplementary Table S1). As a whole, using this designed refinery approach, ~ 61% of the cyanobacterial biomass could be effectively utilized for the production of bioethanol and various industrially vital products. The detailed design for the cyanobacterial refinery using the selected sequence has been schematically illustrated in Fig. 5.

Techno-economic assessment

One of the critical factors that confine the practical implication of a biorefinery is its economic feasibility under large-scale. Hence an idea regarding the techno-economic aspect is vital to apprehend the success of the developed strategy when upgraded to a large-scale scenario. Considering the direct costs involved in a biomass-based biorefinery, huge expenses are incurred in the growth medium of the test species that serve as the raw material for biomass production31. Nonetheless, in our current approach, the cyanobacterial species exploits waste-utilized APL medium for its growth, thereby completely nullifying the cost of the cultivation medium. The efficient nutrient removal ability of A. variabilis further alleviates the expenditure on additional waste remediation infrastructures32. Moreover, since the wastes (for formulating APL medium) were collected from the close vicinity of the experimental site, the transportation charges can also be considered negligible.

However, the harvesting process of the cyanobacterial biomass is a major cost-incurring step that can hinder large-scale biomass production. Hence, proper choice of harvesting methodology is crucial while aiming for biomass harvest under a scaled-up system. Among the different techniques, pH-induced flocculation using NaOH has been reported as the most economical and eco-friendly harvesting method for large-scale set-ups33,34. Assuming a scaled-up cultivation system of 10,000 L employing the APL medium, the harvest cost is estimated to be 0.765 $. This assessment relies on the published investigation of Koley et al.33, demonstrating the requirement of ~ 62 g NaOH/kg of harvested biomass alongside power consumption of 0.2 kW h/kg for culture agitation under field-level analysis.

Implementing the cyanobacterial refinery would also take into account the investments on the solvents and chemicals for extraction of the products. Following the sequential biorefinery protocol designed in this study, the cost of these extractants per Kg biomass reaches 7420.8 US$ (Table 10). It is worth mentioning here that the expenditure on pre-treatment, fermentation, and separation of bioethanol involving the use of sulfuric acid, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), YPD (yeast extract peptone dextrose) medium, and tributyl phosphate (TBP)26 would also contribute to the overall cost (Table 10).

Table 10 Cost estimation of chemicals and solvents required for harnessing the cyanobacterial products using the sequential biorefinery design, utilizing APL medium. Full size table

Hence, from the above table, the estimated cost of extractants required for the scaled-up biorefinery (10,000 L culture volume) can be evaluated as 63,102 US$. Additionally, the refinery protocol also involves oven drying of the cyanobacterial biomass (Fig. 5). With electricity requirement of ~ 6.32 kWh for obtaining 1 kg dry biomass26,35, the cost for drying the biomass harvested from 10,000 L culture approximates to 7.52 US$.

Despite these outlays, the large-scale execution of the proposed biorefinery looks plausible in view of the high commercial value of the harnessed cyanobacterial products. The projected earnings from commercializing all the cyanobacterial products (EPS, SCC, C-PC, PHB, and bioethanol) obtained under a scaled-up scenario of the present approach corresponds to ~ 7.2 million US$. This estimation has been carried out considering the market price of each product23,26. However, the total production cost would also include the cost of the cultivation set-up. Closed systems like a tubular photobioreactor (PBR) have been reported to account for up to 83% of the capital cost36. Besides, such mass-cultivation operations have to meet with general overhead charges related to cleaning, maintenance, and administration of the plant31. Though open-pond systems are known to procure lesser investments, PBRs ensure higher productivity accompanied by low downstream processing charges23,37. Hence, keeping aside some days for cleaning and maintenance of the system, running multiple cycles of cultivation per year would definitely increase the profit margin. This would, in turn, recompense the cost of initial investments on large-scale projects, helping to overcome the real-time challenges faced while establishing a successful biorefinery.

Environmental sustainability assessment

Environmental sustainability is another significant area to be addressed while assessing the aptness of a developed strategy. One way to conduct this assessment is through the evaluation of impact indicators such as cumulative primary energy (CPE) and global warming potential (GWP)38. Using the LCA (Life Cycle Analysis) methodology with these impact indicators, all the inputs and outputs of a system are taken into account. The output constitutes both quantitative and qualitative products generated, alongside the waste discharges in the environment, including emissions. On the other hand, the inputs encompass all the primary raw materials involved in each step of the production process. Fossil fuel for electricity generation, feedstocks for fertilizers production, energy requirement for extraction, processing, and transportation of the primary growth nutrients of the dedicated crop, etc., all fall under this category39. Therefore, determining the energy efficiency of a system is imperative for evaluating its ecological impact. In this direction, EROI (Energy Return on Investment) is a potential measure to check the energy balance of a particular process/product/system, which can be calculated using the following equation40:

$$EROI = \frac{Product\;energy\,output}{{Primary\;energy\;input\,(CED)}}$$

where ‘Product energy output’ indicates the energetic biomass fraction from which the final energy output (microalgal/cyanobacterial product) has been generated, and ‘CED’ stands for cumulative energy demand.

The above elucidation has been made in the context of third-generation feedstocks (microalgae/cyanobacteria), where a significant contribution to CED arises from the demand for nitrogen and phosphorus, the principal nutrients for their growth41. The value of the EROI should be > 1 to reflect a net positive energy balance41. This can be achieved by adopting strategies to lower the CED, which would, in turn, increase the EROI. Hence utilization of the nutrient-laden APL medium formulated out of wastes is expected to boost the overall EROI value by abating the nutrient supply in the cultivation phase. The carbon richness of the APL medium (Table 5) would also lessen the energy burden by rendering additional CO 2 sparging inessential. Use of the flocculation method for biomass harvest can further reduce the energy consumption involved in the centrifugation step, upsurging the net EROI42.

There always exists a relationship between the energy inputs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Global warming potential (GWP) (expressed as CO 2 equivalents) serves as an important tool for environmental sustainability measurement of a particular process/product. Unfortunately, most present-day biofuel production using conventional crops contributes minimally to GHG mitigation. Cultivation of the terrestrial crops demands clearance of grasslands and forests, which results in the loss of ongoing carbon dioxide capture43. The soil organic matter is also broken down, accelerating the release of carbon from the soil44. Besides, N 2 O emissions from the field applications of fertilizers and pesticides are the foremost contributor to GHG, with GWP > CO 2 by 298 times45. Contrarily, cyanobacteria/algae-derived biofuels have been specified to reduce GHG releases, particularly lowering the emissions from changes in the land-use practices43. The use of fertilizers and pesticides is also prevented46, reducing the N 2 O release. However, the emissions from fossil-fuel-driven energy production cannot be disregarded, as electricity requirement remains indispensable for various operational stages of the production process. The GWP per kWh will depend upon the electricity mix of a particular region47. Nonetheless, from the LCA perspective, an integrated production system with quantitative coproduct generation is known to lessen the extent of ecological impact48. This again points toward the large-scale applicability of the APL mediated biorefinery design, as it induced a remarkable rise in the yield of all the cyanobacterial products. Moreover, using cyanobacterial cultivation as a means of nutrient removal avoids the energy investment on separate wastewater treatment procedures, also withdrawing the release of the related emissions.

Cyanobacterial cultivation can suffer a major setback, specifically in areas where freshwater is limited. Hence, utilization of wastewater medium can also be a boon in lessening the freshwater inputs for the cultivation process. Taking ‘Water Footprints (WF)’ as an indicator of water-use extent, application of wastewater instead of freshwater would reduce the blue WF. Furthermore, the biologically treated wastewater can be recycled and reused. This would also help lower the grey WF by abating the chances of freshwater pollution23. A comprehensive take on the sustainability analysis of a multiproduct cyanobacterial biorefinery study would still mandate the complete LCA of each product. This would involve the evaluation of all the input and output parameters for every step right from cultivation, harvest, downstream processing, product generation, use, and disposal. A detailed analysis in this direction will be an essential domain to follow up in the offing.

Nonetheless, herein we try to portray the scope of the present biorefinery design by an ‘onion model’ consisting of distinct layers (Fig. 6). This holistic interpretation gives a clear idea regarding the different levels involved in the process implementation, indicating the specific purpose of each level. It is to be noted that the onion model depicted here has been constructed in view of the futuristic prospects of the present biorefinery design when scaled up to a photobioreactor (PBR) system. The positive scopes of cultivating A. variabilis in a PBR set-up have been discussed in our previous paper23.",,"['Deb', 'Agricultural', 'Food Engineering Department', 'Indian Institute Of Technology Kharagpur', 'Kharagpur', 'Mallick', 'Bhadoria', 'P.

How we ranked

There are vast numbers of spirulina supplements existing in the market, and they claim to offer hundreds of wonders for you. Because we know choosing one can be very challenging, we give you a list of the criteria we used to evaluate each product.

Brand promise

Is the brand promising to cure an illness in a month completely, and all you need is to take a few capsules of some grams of powder? Be cautious of companies making bizarre claims. Remember that wellness and overall healthy body function is not an overnight success, but an arduous and time-consuming effort.

Brand character

Are you familiar with this brand or company? Are they known in the health and wellness industry? Maybe you know a friend or acquaintance who is familiar with them? You can check them out in Better Business Bureau or Trustpilot to make sure there is nothing suspicious about the brand before making any choices.

Product format

Many spirulina supplements come in capsule or tablet form, while others come in powder form. The form doesn’t influence the product’s effectiveness so that you can make any choice according to your preference.

Quantities and amounts

Always be mindful of the number of capsules or tablets per serving, as well as per container. This step also applies to products in powder form. All those features affect the overall product value.

Value for your money

At times, the price can be an indication of quality or, in the case of supplements, potency; if it is very low compared to other brands, the dosages may not be enough or include unproven components. On the other hand, if it is too expensive, it should have the correct amounts of essential ingredients.

GMO-free

An essential factor, the supplement must not contain any genetically modified organism.

Presence of metallic compounds and allergens

Spirulina is naturally grown or cultivated. As such, there should be no heavy metals present. Although some have substantial iron amounts incorporated in the supplement, this is not dangerous as iron is even introduced into baby formulations during infancy.

Another vital indication is the absence of allergens like gluten, egg, lactose, soy, corn, and others.

FDA/cGMP certifications and approvals

It is crucial to discern that a product contains safe and high-quality ingredients. One perfect way to find out is by checking if the products are made in cGMP/FDA approved or certified facilities and processes. There are other third-party certifications and seals for other essential matters about ingredients and components. Some of these are the Halal and Kosher certifications, the Ecocert, USDA, EU Organic, Naturland, and others.

In instances when you don’t have acquaintances that have tried the product before, you can check out websites like iherb.com or Amazon, as well as other online sites associated with health and wellness campaigns.

Who Should Purchase Spirulina supplements?

Individuals with allergies

Research and studies have shown that spirulina could moderate immune function, advancing the allergic rhinitis symptoms via an unknown technique.

Individuals with cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes

Clinical experiments have identified cholesterol- and glucose-lowering effects of spirulina.

People in a state of malnutrition

Because it is densely packed with essential nutrients, spirulina is a high-value nutritional supplement. That is especially important in individuals who are HIV-positive and are malnourished at the same time.

People who are exposed to high arsenic content in drinking water

A critical study has indicated that spirulina could be used to treat individuals with protracted arsenic poisoning caused by contaminated drinking water.

Individuals who have weak immune systems

Spirulina holds immunity-enhancing effects, which can be useful in fighting cancers and viral infections. Moreover, spirulina may have direct antiviral activity.

There is no conclusive evidence that currently indicates the use of spirulina as individual therapy, or to replace conventional treatment for each of the indications mentioned earlier. We recommend consulting your doctor before altering your treatment program.

How Do I Choose a Good Spirulina Supplement?

Effective spirulina supplements should be manufactured by respectable companies that rigorously abide by good manufacturing practices (GMP). They must be essentially free of microcystins and heavy metal contamination.

Furthermore, they should not contain any GMO or genetically modified organisms and should be free of allergens such as gluten, egg, lactose, soy, corn, etc.

The mode or form of dosage is also of import in selecting the best spirulina supplement for your needs. Most come either in pill/tablet/capsule or pure powder form. Whichever type you choose does not affect the potency or effectivity of the product in any way.

Price is also an indication of potency and effectiveness. Most of the spirulina brands have comparable price ranges, thus giving you a guide at a reasonable cost. Anything grossly too low or too expensive is suspect and should be considered with care before purchasing.

Other pluses would be certifications or seals of approval by reputable organizations within the health and wellness communities, quality circles, and standardization institutions. Examples of such are Halal, Kosher, Eurocert, USDA, among others.

Lastly, it wouldn’t hurt to check out the feedback from other users. You may have acquaintances that are familiar with some of the brands. Otherwise, hundreds of reviews, health and wellness websites and online shopping sites (like Amazon, iHerb, etc.) feature lots of user feedback. Most of these are excellent sources of information, not just for prospective buyers, but also for the manufacturers themselves as an alternative feedback system.

With all that in mind, you can now start your deliberation in choosing the best option that will suit your needs and preferences. For additional information to help you in your selection, please continue reading on the following sections on spirulina’s benefits, possible side effects, dosage recommendation, frequently-asked questions, and our final summary with suggestions.

What Are Spirulina’s Benefits?

Spirulina, cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, is popularly referred to as a “superfood.” It has become the theme of about a thousand highly acclaimed scientific papers, and a vast number of research findings. Some principal spirulina applications include:

Nutrient-filled

Spirulina is a microorganism that is highly rich in nutrients. One tablespoon of pure spirulina powder contains typically 4 grams of protein, vast amounts of copper, magnesium, iron, vitamin B complex, and more. Spirulina is considered by many as the best nutritious food on earth gram-for-gram. Due to this, spirulina is mixed with several energy bars, health supplements, and superfood blends. In other words, spirulina functions as the best source of amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and various nutrients essential to the normal function of our bodies.

Anti-inflammatory & antioxidant

Spirulina is known to have powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The foremost active complex in it is phycocyanin. Interestingly the very compound provides spirulina its distinctive hue. Phycocyanin has powerful anti-inflammatory properties, and also defends from oxidative damage triggered by radical elements. Oxidation-related stress can amplify the danger of several health issues, such as cancer, causing several experts to consider that antioxidants similar to those present in spirulina can aid in reducing the danger of cancer acquisition.

Cholesterol

Spirulina, in many instances, is believed to possess a beneficial influence on cholesterol quantities, theoretically reducing triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. It is also useful in increasing (HDL) “good” cholesterol levels while decreasing “bad” cholesterol. So, spirulina can aid in lowering a number of threat aspects for heart diseases and various severe health issues.

Cancer

Spirulina was able to reveal some potential in averting the growth of cancer, mostly oral cancers. One research in India monitored a group of 87 people having pre-cancerous lesions inside their mouths. One year after continuous spirulina administration, 45% of the participants indicated full degeneration of cancerous-like lesions, as opposed to only 7% in the control population. Spirulina has presented substantial potential in dealing with oral cancers, although some scientists think it could have the capacity for a wide variety of cancers. Further research is necessary.

Blood pressure

Certain pieces of evidence indicate that spirulina can aid in lowering blood pressure. That effect is due to spirulina’s influence on the production of nitric oxide, which assists blood vessels, causing them to relax and dilate. Additional research is required.

Exercise

Spirulina can aid in boosting exercise endurance and performance. Oxidative harmful effects towards the muscles are brought about by exercise, thereby contributing to muscle weakness. The antioxidant activity of spirulina is believed to negate particular oxidative damage, enabling athletes to function longer without getting exhausted.

Blood sugar

Many animal studies show spirulina being a promising instrument in managing glucose levels in blood and diabetes indications. Spirulina mostly beat prescription medications for diabetes in some instances. Clinical confirmations in the human trial are incomplete, but a minor study discovered a substantial drop of blood sugar amounts in patients with diabetes (type-2). Further research is required.

Generally, spirulina is exceptionally nutritious and possesses a plethora of latent health advantages. It is a scarce food that is deserving of being called “superfood.” The amount of nutrient contained is sufficient to contemplate spirulina consumption, not to mention its potential for considerable health benefits.

Side Effects of Spirulina

In 2011, the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), through its Dietary Supplements Information Expert Committee (DSI-EC), appointed spirulina a ‘class A’ safety rating, signifying that the existing scientific evidence does not pose a severe health risk.

On its own, spirulina is mostly safe to consume and has no side effects. However, problems can occur if the spirulina gets contaminated with heavy metals and other toxic pollutants. Arsenic, mercury, or lead poisoning could come from inadvertently consuming contaminated spirulina. One other potential spirulina contaminant is microcystin, a toxin that can damage livers.

Most of the spirulina supplements suggest the avoidance of intake for pregnant women and nursing mothers. Also important is keeping the product away from children and minors. Of course, the best recommendation is to consult your doctor before consuming any of the supplement brands.

Recommended dosage

Spirulina supplements usually come in either dried powder form or capsules/tablets. Capsules are more expedient to take, but the powder can be mixed into bread, salads, smoothies, or used as seasonings in various foods. The option of form and method of consumption depends on personal choice, and whatever is utilized would yield the same results.

The typical spirulina dosage is from 2.8 to 3.0 grams per day. That’s about 5-6 tablets (500mg) or a teaspoon of powder a day. Of course, that is subject to the recommendation of a health specialist or a physician.

FAQs

What is Spirulina?

Spirulina is the popular name for two microorganism species: Arthrospira maxima and Arthrospira platensis. While it is often referred to as blue-green algae, the spirulina being used in several dietary supplements theoretically belongs to the group Cyanobacteria, a type of non-infectious bacteria that is named after its bluish hue.

Which spirulina species is used frequently?

Of the two spirulina species, the most commonly used in nutritional supplements is the spirulina platensis.

Where is spirulina found?

Spirulina is usually seen naturally propagating in tropical regions and by the lakes as biomass or microorganism. It is usually cultivated and utilized as a whole food by itself, or processed into powder as dietary supplements. The Aztecs were the first to utilize it as a customary food source.

Why is spirulina called a “superfood?”

Spirulina contains substantial amounts of essential amino acids, vital fatty acids, glycolipids, minerals, polysaccharides, proteins, and vitamins. Protein takes up nearly 70% of spirulina’s dry weight, which is about thrice as much as beef protein! Spirulina provides about 290 calories/100 grams of the “superfood” that it has been considered a strategic player in the discussion to focus on food scarcity and security concerns.

What nutrients does spirulina have?

The most excellent spirulina supplements provide amino acids, iron (including other minerals), protein, vitamins, and beneficial lipids such as gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Some spirulina supplements are also reinforced with additional minerals and nutrients, augmenting the benefits of full dried spirulina or its extract.

Does spirulina have special uses?

Also, because of its exceptionally high nutritional value and straightforwardness of cultivation, NASA scientists have suggested that spirulina be grown and utilized as a food source by astronauts while on missions in space!

Recap

We have shown you the benefits of the spirulina “superfood” and its subsequent supplement derivatives. Due to the organism’s almost extraordinary nutritional value, hundreds of supplements are available in the market. And choosing the best option for your specific needs and requirements can be a challenge.

We hope that providing you with the proper guide indicating the features and particulars to be considered has helped you in searching for the optimal brand.

As a summary, we reiterate the need to check if the supplement brand you are considering has the necessary features, ingredients, certifications (USDA, non-GMO certs, Halal, Kosher, etc.). It must be manufactured in GMP-certified facilities and processes; it should be allergen-free (Gluten-free), and must not contain any heavy metals or contaminants. You should also verify its potency concerning the product’s value for your money.

Finally, we emphasize the importance of consulting with your doctor prior to consuming the available supplements, especially if you are pre-diagnosed with a medical condition.

Good luck, and we hope you thoroughly enjoy the benefits of your choice of the best spirulina supplement!",,"['Ash', 'Ace', 'Ash Is A Certified Personal Trainer Through The American Council On Exercise', 'Ace . She Holds B.A. In Biology Rutgers', 'M.S. In Exercise Science', 'Kinesiology']"
phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,Spirulina benefits: Effects of spirulina on sport performances,"Spirulina is type of blue-green algae rich in nutrients and antioxidants and it is also one of the most popular nutritional supplements in the world. As a result, spirulina is associated with a number of positive health effects, most notably effects which apply to the area of sport performances.

Here, we take a closer look at how spirulina affects sporting performances.

First of all, spirulina is 55-70 percent protein, which is a percentage significantly larger than those of beef (25 percent protein) and eggs (13 percent). Therefore, this makes spirulina a key source of long-lasting energy for athletes, whilst assisting them with muscle growth and improving stamina.

Given that it is algae, it is also far easier than the likes of lentils, beef and cow's milk to digest, as there is no extra cell membrane to break down. Whilst the net protein use of spirulina is around 52 percent, those of lentils, beef and cow's milk are 30 percent, 15 percent and 12 percent respectively.

Furthermore, spirulina contains a pigment called phycocyanin which gives it its unique blue-green colour. It is a key antioxidant which assists athletes with anti-inflammation. This can be a significant aid to athletes given the amount of physical stress which they endure on a regular basis.

What other health benefits does spirulina bring?

Aside from a strictly sporting perspective, there is evidence that spirulina may have anti-cancer properties and that it may reduce blood pressure.

For example, in a recent study in India involving 87 people with precancerous lesions, among those who took one gram of spirulina per day for one year 45 percent of these people saw the lesions disappear.

With regards to a reduction in blood pressure, a dose of 4.5 grams per day has been proven to reduce the blood pressure of individuals with normal levels.",,[]
phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,Why Spirulina Is Considered a Superfood for Dogs,"As dog parents are becoming more conscious about what they feed their pup, many are incorporating human food into their diet. That’s because a lot of what we feed our dog during mealtime provides the bare minimum nutritional requirements. While dogs are no strangers to carrots, apples, and blueberries tossed their way, some new human foods are making waves – and rightfully so.

Spirulina is one of them. The microscopic algae, grown in both in salt and fresh water, comprises an extraordinarily high volume of protein (around 60%, according to the FDA) and is dense in nutrients. It contains significant amounts of beta carotene; iron; vitamin A, E, and B; potassium, and minerals, among other good-for-your-dog ingredients. And when taken in the correct dosage, it may provide a range of health benefits for your dog.

“Aside from being packed full of trace minerals, spirulina is rich in carotenoid antioxidants that may help to improve gastrointestinal function, strengthen the immune system and aid in allergy relief,” says Sarah Lyman, a clinical pet nutritionist at Bonafide Pet Nutrition & Counseling.

The Main Benefits of Spirulina For Dogs

Besides being rich in nutrients, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, spirulina is believed to have an array of health benefits for dogs. But before you introduce any new food or ingredient into your dog’s diet, make sure you consult a veterinarian or nutritionist.

1. May Reduce Allergies in Dogs

Over the past 10 years, there has been a 30% increase in environmental allergy cases, according to a report from Banfield Pet Hospital. The team also found that dogs with food allergies are more prone to skin infections. If your dog suffers from allergies, spirulina could help.

“Spirulina is the source of the anti-inflammatory Gamma Linoleic Acid (GLA), an essential fatty acid which can aid in allergy relief,” says Lyman.

Indeed, research has shown spirulina may help with allergies in dogs because it has anti-inflammatory properties that are paired with the algae’s natural antihistamine properties.

2. Could Improve Digestion and Gastrointestinal Health in Dogs

If your dog has trouble with her digestion or gastrointestinal health, spirulina could help. The microscopic algae has shown to be beneficial in ridding a dog’s body of dangerous gut bacteria and improving bowel function. Essentially spirulina quells bad bacteria while promoting healthy gut flora that a dog’s body needs – and this could mean an increase in your dog’s energy.

3. Supports Strengthening a Dog’s Immune System

When a dog’s immune system in compromised, our furry friend may become vulnerable to diseases, including di suffer from poor immune system health, spirulina may help, as it’s known to possess various minerals and vitamins to boost the immune system.

For example, some of the key properties found in spirulina are polysaccharides, phytonutrients, and sulfolipids. All these properties play a vital role in strengthening a dog’s immune system, which in turn helps your pet fight off unwanted infections while promoting healthy cell growth.

“The primary medicinal activity of spirulina is it helps with cleansing the blood. It contains the antioxidant called superoxide dismutase which is a scavenger of free radicals in the body,” says Lyman.

In addition, spirulina has been shown to promotes cell generation, which is an integral part of maintaining a healthy immune system in dogs.

4. A Potential Tool to Fight Back Against Cancer in Dogs

Nearly half of all dogs over the age of 10 will develop cancer, according to the American Veterinary Medical Foundation. If you are worried about your dog developing this disease, spirulina may be a supplement to consider.

Due to the numerous healthy properties of spirulina, it is recognized as a potential cancer-fighting superfood, as studies have shown it may protect against DNA mutations. Not only is it good for helping to prevent cancer, but it is also beneficial for those dogs that already have the disease.

“The beautiful green color of spirulina called phycocyanin has been reported to inhibit cancer formation and may enhance neurotransmitter formation,” says Lyman.

Spirulina can do this because it stimulates natural killer cells and other immune components in a dog’s immune system, which help to fight cancer cells. Additionally, the blue-green algae may work to repair certain parts of a dog’s genetic material that has been damaged from radiation treatments commonly used to treat cancer.

5. Could Help Get Rid of Bad Dog Breath

Because spirulina is a great source of chlorophyll (what gives plants their green color), the biomolecule is believed to help support waste elimination. It also has beneficial deodorizing effects, it may help eliminate odors.

How To Feed Your Dog Spirulina

There are a number ways to give your dog spirulina. Some people buy supplements, others sprinkle a spirulina powder on their dog’s food.There are functional treats with spirulina in them, including Bye Bye Dog Breath dental sticks.

“Pet parents should choose a product without artificial colorings, flavorings, preservatives, and ask the manufacturer whether their product has been checked for contamination as some strains have been harvested from sources contaminated with heavy metals,” says Lyman.

Are There Any Side Effects Associated With Giving Your Dog Spirulina?

When introducing any new supplement or ingredient into your dog’s diet, there is always the possibility of side effects.

“It is safe to use daily but because its nutrient content is so concentrated, it can cause diarrhea and digestive upset if consumed in excessive quantities,” says Lyman.

And as mentioned above, the blue-green algae may be contaminated with metal during harvesting.

If your dog is on other medications, spirulina could interact with them.

This is why it’s crucial to follow vet and pet nutritionist recommendations before giving your dog spirulina.

What To Remember When Choosing Spirulina For Your Dog

Before you introduce spirulina into your dog’s diet, do your research, as not all are not created equally. Look for reputable brands and read the label carefully to understand the concentration level and dosage. Also, check to see if they use third-party verification for authenticity and see where the company gets its spirulina from. And if you have questions, ask.

“Adding spirulina to your dog’s diet is a great way to boost their overall health and well-being,” Says Lyman. “Taking the time to research the company of the spirulina product you intend to buy is key. Some companies can cut corners to save money – if a product price is cheap, it is likely produced in a poor manner and potentially contaminated.”

A study published in the journal ‘Marine Biotechnology’ in February 2021 by scientists from Israel and Iceland propounds that extracts from blue-green algae can prevent COVID-19 patients from getting seriously ill. According to the scientists, a derivative of enhanced spirulina can reduce the probability of the cytokine storm triggered by the coronavirus in the lungs, which can cause acute respiratory distress, by 70%. This is possible because the extract from this alga contains a pigment-binding protein that augments anti-inflammation, anti-tumor, and anti-oxidation activities in the body.

Another study, conducted in June 2020 by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), found that spirulina extracts can potentially inhibit the entry of SARS, MERS, and SARS-2 spike pseudotyped virus in vitro. Thus, the coronavirus outbreak is likely to boost the adoption of natural algae extracts and brighten the outlook of this market.

phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,This new blue beer is already selling out in France,"Several years back, blue wine was making headlines in France. Now in 2022, it’s blue beer that’s creating a bit of a stir.

Hoppy Urban Brew (aka HUB) — based in the city of Roubaix, not far from the Belgian border — teamed up with a company called Etika Spirulina which grows spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, that is then supplied to the brewery to give the beer its blue hue, according to Reuters. The hope is that the eye-catching drink — which gets its colour from the compound phycocyanin — can also help Etika Spirulina promote its algae as a dietary supplement.

The blue beer is in demand

“It’s getting an enormous amount of interest and curiosity on the part of the public,” Sebastien Verbeke, a brewery employee, told the news outlet. HUB is reportedly already working on ramping up production after 1,500 bottles of the 3-percent ABV brew (which is called Line) sold out over the last three months of 2021.

Despite its blue colour, the beer itself is billed as a session IPA. “It’s quite disconcerting,” HUB’s Mathilde Vanmansart explained while tasting the beer, “because since it’s blue, our brains expect a certain note, but, no, we really have here a session IPA, a very light beer, and the flavours of the beer really come through. We can taste that it has a light alcohol content with quite the taste of hops, with slight notes of citrus. And in the back of the mouth, there’s a slight taste of lychee. It’s quite refreshing.”

Of course, after 40 years of craft beer, seemingly everything has been done before. We’ve seen a blue beer coloured with blue seaweed in Japan, covered a green “algae” beer in Ohio (though it wasn’t actually made with algae) — and, yes, a quick search on Untappd shows that, indeed, breweries have tossed spirulina in beers before to help coax out a blue hue. But when it comes to convincing people to consume algae, every bit helps, right?

phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,"5+ Spirulina Benefits, Nutrition, and Side Effects – Archziner.com","If you’ve been keeping up with the new health and lifestyle trends, you’ve probably heard of spirulina. So, if you’re wondering how spirulina benefits you, what you can use it for and what the big craze around it is, you’ve come to the right place! These green-blue algae are one of the oldest life forms on Earth. First used by the Aztecs, this superfood has various nutrients and antioxidants. For hundreds of years spirulina has been a source of food in many cultures around the globe. It is cultivated for use as a dietary supplement, a whole food and even for hair and skin care. Algae are having a rise in popularity, from spirulina to sea moss. Loaded with tons of good stuff, there is very little that algae doesn’t do. That is why in this article, we will explore the benefits and uses of spirulina.

These green-blue algae are one of the oldest life forms on Earth

This green-blue alga that has minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, protein, and carotenoids. It is an alga that grows naturally in both fresh and salt mineral-rich waters. However, spirulina is most typically grows in warm water climates. It is a type of cyanobacteria, which is a family of single-celled microbes that are green-blue algae. Just like plants, cyanobacteria can produce energy from sunlight thorough the process of photosynthesis.

You can find these algae on the market sold as a dark-green powder or pills

Spirulina is full with polyphenols and flavonoids. One of them being phycoyanin. It is one of the main things contributing to the high antioxidant amount. You can find these algae on the market sold as a dark-green powder or pills. There is also a blue form of spirulina, however there isn’t much difference between the two. Blue spirulina is made when phycocyanin, which is a water-soluble antioxidant, gets removed from the spirulina. Afterwards it turns into a blue powder. This antioxidant is found only is some green-blue algae, one of which spirulina. That is the main differences between other green foods like barley, chlorella, wheatgrass and spirulina.

There is green and blue spirulina

What Does Spirulina Taste Like?

Spirulina definitely has a specific taste, some may find unattractive. While it does have more of a neutral taste, it also can have a “sea” or “lake water” vibe to it. Spirulina also may have an earthy taste with a slightly sulfuric edge. While it can certainly become an acquired, pleasant taste, most people initially wrinkle their noses to it. However, there are many ways to add spirulina to your food and make it taste pleasant. Add it into your breakfast smoothie, oatmeal or sprinkle it inside of your favorite soups and salads. There are plenty of ideas you can try out. You can also incorporate it into baked goods. Or just add it into your glass of water, smoothie, fresh and just drink it like that.

Spirulina benefits us in many ways

Spirulina Nutrition Facts

As we mentioned, spirulina has many healthy nutrients. The standard daily dose of spirulina is 1–3 grams. Some studies have shown that doses of up to 3,000 milligrams per day were safe and well tolerated for up to 12 months with no notable side effects. While manufacturer recommendations vary, as a general rule, it’s best to never exceed the dosage on the product label. Spirulina contains decent amounts of magnesium, potassium, and manganese and small amounts of almost every other nutrient that you need for a balanced, healthy lifestyle. Spirulina may be the single most nutritious food on the planet. In addition, a tablespoon of this alga holds only 20 calories. A single tablespoon of dried spirulina powder contains all of these recommended daily amounts of vitamins and nutrients:

Protein : 4 grams

: 4 grams Vitamin B1 : 11%

: 11% Vitamin B2 : 15%

: 15% Iron : 11%

: 11% Vitamin B3 : 4%

: 4% Copper: 21%

Spirulina contains small amounts of almost every other nutrient needed for a balanced lifestyle

Is Spirulina Good For You?

Okay, now that we have a basic idea of what spirulina is and where it comes from, let’s see what are all these benefits we keep mentioning.

Spirulina benefits are many

Immune Booster

As we already saw, spirulina is rich in a range of vitamins and minerals like vitamins E, C, and B6. They are essential for maintaining a healthy immune system. Research shows that this alga also boosts the production of white blood cells and antibodies that fight viruses and other bacteria that is found in the body. The compound phycocyanin we can find in spirulina is an antioxidant that helps fight off anything that could cause damage to your cells.

Research shows that this alga boosts the production of white blood cells

Allergy Relief

If you suffer from allergic rhinitis, spirulina may help bring you some relief. A study found that only two grams a day are more than enough to help improve symptoms. Things like nasal discharge, sneezing, nasal congestion and itching are a part of the past. Spirulina helps top the release of histamines, which cause allergy symptoms. The anti-inflammatory effect caused by spirulina’s antioxidants may help people with allergies caused by pollen, animal hair, and dust.

Spirulina may help bring some relief to allergy symptoms

Lowers Cholesterol

Studies have shown that taking spirulina may help to lower cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is the unhealthful fat found in a person’s blood. Spirulina significantly reduces the “bad” (low-density lipoprotein) type of cholesterol and while increasing the “good” (high-density lipoprotein) type of cholesterol. Researchers found that taking 1 g of spirulina every day reduced a participant’s total cholesterol after 3 months.

Spirulina may help to lower cholesterol levels

Heart Health

No matter at what age, heart health is important. As we mentioned, spirulina can help reduce the body’s absorption of cholesterol. This helps keep your arteries clear, reduces the strain on the heart that typically leads to heart disease and strokes. The protein in the alga also helps reduce the triglyceride levels. These are fats in your blood that can contribute to the hardening of arteries, increasing the risk of heart problems, diabetes, and pancreatitis. Spirulina also increases nitric oxide production in your body as well, which helps your blood vessels relax and widen, so blood can move through freely. Studies show that this can reduce your blood pressure, lowering your heart disease and reduces the chance of blood clots.

Heart health is important at any age

Anti-Cancer

Spirulina may have a positive effect in protecting the body against cancer. Chronic inflammation contributes to cancer and other diseases. Phycocyanin, which is the pigment that gives spirulina its green-blue color, has been found to not only reduce inflammation in the body, but also block tumor growth and kill cancer cells. Other nutrients present in the alga such as chlorophyll and beta-carotene are also proven to fight cancer cells and protect vision from aging.

Spirulina reduceses inflammation in the body

Helps Diabetes Management

Taking supplements with spirulina help improve glucose control, insulin resistance and as we mentioned reduce cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure. A small study found that spirulina may improve insulin sensitivity and lower total cholesterol levels in people with diabetes. High fasting blood sugar is a common problem in people with diabetes type 1 and 2. This suggests that spirulina supplements may help people control diabetes. Spirulina has at least four grams of protein for each tablespoon. This makes it great for controling blood sugar and overall diabetes control.

Spirulina supplements may help people control diabetes

Metabolism Booster

Our metabolism plays an important part when it comes to losing, gaining or maintaining weight. Studies have shown that taking six grams of the alga each day can have a beneficial metabolic effect, aid with weight loss and create a better health-related quality of life. It can help a person have more energy consequently burning plenty of calories everday. Plus even though this alga is full of nutrients, it only has 20 calories per tablespoon. It also contains an amino acid called l-phenylalanin. This acid helps to suppress appetite.

This alga has a beneficial metabolic effect

Mood Booster

Spirulina may play a potential benefit when it comes to helping with mood problems.

This alga is a source of tryptophan, which is an amino acid. Tryptophan helps support the production of serotonin or otherwise known as the hormone of happiness. If you suffer from depression, bipolar and eating disorders, anxiety and others, you most likely have reduced levels of serotonin. Taking such supplements will help to create a mental wellbeing.

Mood disorders can be treated with spirulina

Muscles

If you’re not interested in weightless, but rather in muscle gain, spirulina can help. When it comes to exercise and fitness benefits, spirulina can help enhance muscle strength, endurance, and performance. Studies have shown that men who took six grams of spirulina every day for four weeks had longer periods of exercising without feeling fatigue. This, once again, comes down to the better blood flow spirulina creates. However, reaping the rewards of all the nutrients, especially protein in this case, is quite the contributing factor as well.

Spirulina can help enhance muscle strength, endurance, and performance

Eye and Oral Health

Spirulina contains a lot of zeaxanthin. This is a plant pigment that may help reduce the risk of cataracts and age-related vision loss. The antibacterial properties found in zeaxanthin may also help promote good oral health. One study found that spirulina-enhanced mouthwash reduced dental plaque and the risk of gingivitis in participants. It also lowers the risk of oral cancer in people who chew tobacco.

The plant pigment may help reduce the risk of cataracts and age-related vision loss

Flushes Out Toxins

Spirulina is amazing when it comes to helping our bodies flush out toxins! It’s even used as a natural water filter. This is because it contains protein and peptides that are particularly good at finding toxins and excreting them out of our bodies. That way, pollutants such as arsenic, fluoride, iron, lead, and mercury aren’t being absorbed into the bloodstream but are rather working their way out of our system.

Spirulina is amazing when it comes to helping our bodies flush out toxins

Women’s Health

This green little supplement is great for women’s reproductive organs. Just like how spirulina is a magnet for toxins such as heavy metals, it also helps to attract candida cells and can flush them out of the body. And the part is that it isn’t just bringing balance down below. The same course of action can happen in the gut, as well, to help bring balance there.

Spirulina is a magnet for toxins such as heavy metals and candida cells

Antioxidants

A process called oxidation can lead to ongoing inflammation and damage to cells. This over time can lead to chronic diseases and potentially cancer. Thankfully, spirulina is full of antioxidant compounds. One of which is phycocyanin. As we mentioned, this compound is responsible for spirulina’s dark green-blue colour . However, it also helps dampen oxidation and inhibit inflammation. Studies suggest phycocyanin has potential benefits, including anti-inflammatory properties, oxidative stress protection and neuroprotective qualities. Antioxidants are super beneficial to our health.

Spirulina is packed with antioxidants

Spirulina Side Effects

Although spirulina is generally safe to use, some unwanted side effects may occur, that you need to be aware of. While it is tolerated well by most, in some people it may cause headaches, muscle pain, sweating and insomnia. If you have an allergy to seafood, seaweed, and other sea vegetables, there is a chance you may also be allergic to spirulina, as it is after all a sea alga. Other than that there are some situations in which spirulina can have a negative effect.

Pregnant women should avoid using spirulina

Negative Effects

People with autoimmune diseases. Research shows that spirulina can support immune system function. However, this could worsen symptoms in people with auto-immune diseases like lupus, multiple sclerosis, or arthritis. Always speak to your doctor before starting any types of supplements.

If you are taking immunosuppressive drugs or pills to treat diabetes, and blood thinners, it’s recommended to stay away from spirulina.

People with a disorder called phenylketonuria. This disorder makes the body unable to process certain amino acids. Spirulina is rich in amino acids.

Pregnant or nursing women. There is not enough research to suggest that spirulina is safe to use while pregnant. That is why it is best to avoid it.

Bleeding Disorders. Since spirulina can help reduce blood clotting, it may increase the risk of bruising and bleeding in people with certain bleeding disorders.

People with B12 deficiency. Sometimes it’s hard for the body to absorb this vitamin. If you have a deficiency, most common in people with plant-based diets, it’s best to make sure you are supplementing this vitamin from another source. Spirulina has high levels of vitamin B 12.

Toxic spirulina. Spirulina that has been harvested in the wild may be contaminated with heavy metals and bacteria. In high amounts, some of these toxins may stress or damage your liver. Make sure to search for companies that are organic, non-GMO, and gluten-free. This will limit cross-contamination.

Spirulina Benefits Skin

Spirulina can boost the overall health and radiant appearance of your skin. Not only that but it can help prevent acne build up and swelling. Since spirulina is rich in nutrients, vitamins and both fatty and amino acids, it helps decreases inflammation, tones the skin and encourages cell turnover to promote a more youthful-looking complexion. It can also help people struggling with eczema and psoriasis. Algae face masks are super popular and beneficial.

Gilda Smith

My struggles started with a red ring-shaped, scaly rash on my left pinkie. Later it was diagnosed as Tinea Manuum and it became severe with round itchy patches all over my hand. I have tried many ointments and drugs to tackle it, but everything failed. Later, I started taking Mycosyn Pro pills and all signs of infection were completely gone within 3 months.

phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,Why This Blue Beer Has Major Health Benefits,"Unlike the green beer swilled by the masses on St. Patrick's Day, which uses green food dye, Line's bluish tint is caused by the pigment phycocyanin found in the blue-green algae known as spirulina, according to Food & Wine. Like its green counterpart, the blue color doesn't impact the beer's flavor in any discernible way. It is made in the style of a session IPA, producing notes of citrus and a slight hoppiness.

Since it contains spirulina, the beer provides a number of potential health benefits, and clocking in at a modest 3% ABV (Alcohol by Volume), you're unlikely to get inebriated if you indulge in one or two. This particular type of algae, which is available in dietary supplements, is packed with protein and rich in vitamins, according to Medical News Today. A series of studies published through the National Library of Medicine have indicated that spirulina also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help strengthen the immune system.

Blue-green algae is often labeled a superfood as well, although this is not a medical or scientific term and can sometimes be associated with product marketing hype. Regardless, spirulina is nutrient-dense and low in calories, so ""To your health"" just might prove a fitting toast for those raising a glass of this quirky blue beer.",,['Colin Mccandless']

phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,Ful brings ‘climate active’ blue spirulina soft drinks to the UK,"Microalgae challenger brand Ful is bringing a trio of healthy blue soft drinks it claims are ‘climate active’ to the UK – and plans to eventually begin selling the key ingredient to bigger suppliers in fmcg.

It has launched a trio of drinks, called Revive, online in three flavours: White Peach, Lemon & Ginger and Mint & Lime (rsp: £20.50/6x275ml).

The drinks contain a type of “nutritionally dense” microalgae called spirulina and are low in calories and sugar. Their blue colour comes from phycocyanin, a natural antioxidant found in spirulina.

The drinks, which have already launched in the Netherlands, are claimed to be ‘climate active’ because the microalgae absorb one and a half to two times their weight in carbon and photosynthesise it, releasing oxygen.

Ful had worked with “leading food and flavour scientists” to transform the spirulina – which “usually tastes and smells unpleasant” – into a “tasty water-soluble, unapologetically blue superfood”, it said.

This had been the “main barrier” for the brand, said CEO Julia Streuli.

Through a “natural biorefinery process”, the team was able to take out the “better-tasting nutrients” and blue colour from the spirulina and produce a branded microalgae ingredient, Ful Superfood, which was used in its “craveable” Revive drinks, said Streuli.

The brand’s ultimate ambition was to popularise and supply the ingredient to other fmcg businesses, she said, adding huge suppliers like Nestlé “could use the Ful Superfood ingredient to sell their own climate active products in the future”.

However, she said the brand would primarily focus on building its brand through the Revive range – as well as expanding its own range into other categories such as snack bars, energy gels and powders – before actively pursuing B2B customers.

“What we eat and drink every day matters and presents an opportunity for us as consumers to make a difference,” said Streuli.

In the coming months Streuli said she hoped to see the Revive drinks sold at various fitness studios, restaurants and retailers across the UK that focused on health and sustainability.

The launch comes as Ful was recently awarded a grant by the Dutch government after it proposed a fully circular production process, which would see it make use of waste carbon from breweries.",,['Niamh Leonard-Bedwell']
phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,Algenist Launches Blue Algae Vitamin C Skinclarity Brightening Serum,"The unique form of vitamin C is said to help visibly restore skin clarity and improve skin texture in 10 days.

Algenist has launched the Blue Algae Vitamin C Skinclarity Brightening Serum, featuring its Blue Algae Vitamin C, an L-ascorbic acid made from regenerative spirulina blue-green algae.

The unique form of vitamin C is said to help visibly restore skin clarity and improve skin texture in 10 days.

Skinclarity Brightening Serum is also formulated with Algenist's patented Alguronic Acid to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles; a marine ferment to help improve the appearance of skin texture and hydrate skin; a moisturizing complex that combines hyaluronic acid and Alguronic Acid to help provide a clinically measured increase in skin hydration; and tansy extract to help condition and soothe skin.

The vegan product is said to target the appearance of pigmentation, appearing most prominently in the fair and deep complexions as dark spots, uneven tone and texture, and overall dullness.

The serum retails for $72 at the brand's site and at Sephora.

Tammy Yaiser, VP product development, said: ""The team was inspired by the extensive research on blue-green algae, and for the potential to derive, extract and isolate its naturally-occurring vitamin C component and then to regeneratively produce it in a lab. The spirulina is sustainably grown, and the naturally-occurring vitamin C component is isolated and concentrated. The result is a highly pure ascorbic acid raw material, identified simply on the ingredient list as 'ascorbic acid.' What's also exciting about the process is that the leftover algae by-product is still rich in nutrients and can be beneficial for other applications such as fermentation, agricultural fertilizers and wastewater remediation. A part of the leftover biomass is used for making spirulina extract and spirulina oil. We considered the whole process.""

CEO Rose Fernandez, said: ""When we set out to solve a problem in 10 days with each of our formulas, the process is rigorous. If an ingredient or technology does not exist to help deliver on our promise of 10-day results, or if we see a way to re-envision traditional methods ingredients are made to elevate our commitment to high-performance, naturally-sourced and more sustainably-produced ingredients—we will make our own. This is how the brand was born and proudly continues today. Today we have consumers searching for vitamin C at high rates. This inspired us to develop a naturally-derived, potent vitamin C from a bold, blue spirulina. In our scientific study, our new Blue Algae Vitamin C outperformed other commonly used forms of vitamin C and other brightening ingredients specifically used for targeting pigmentation that we tested. No surprise given our reputation. This coupled with the fact that there was an opportunity to develop a new vitamin C serum actually clinically studied on melanin-rich skin—who can experience skin sensitivity, blotchiness or even products that simply don't work.""

Microalgae are also known as microphytes. They are microscopic algae that are found in marine systems and freshwater. According to their species, they can vary in size and shape, ranging from micrometers to hundred micrometers. The main function of microalgae is that it converts the sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into algal biomass. Gaining popularity as a promising nutrient source, microalgae impart high nutrition and comprise high-value compounds including pigments, fatty acids, and anti-oxidants.

The Impact of COVID-19 on the Microalgae Market

The COVID-19 pandemic has strained consumer F&B product manufacturers due to reduced consumption and disrupted supply chains. The F&B sector has witnessed a minor decline due to the lockdowns imposed across various countries. This scenario has also negatively impacted the confectionery industry since people are buying only essential products. In addition, government bodies have passed various rules and regulations on the purchase of essential goods. According to trade organizations in the nutritional products industry, there has been a significant impact on the global supply chain for functional foods and dietary supplements, which has, in turn, lowered the consumption of microalgal biomass among end-users impacting the growth of this market.

In the algae industry, a major slowdown in microalgae sales was witnessed in the first quarter of 2020 due to disruptions in logistics and transportation. The market also witnessed interruptions in the entire value chain from raw materials supply for culture media to production, packaging, and biomass distribution.

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this market were felt in China starting 2020, as the country is one of the world's largest producers and one of the leading consumers of microalgal species. In China, factory closures, microalgae processing facilities operating at reduced capacities, and restrictions on importing and exporting algae biomass strongly impacted the microalgae market. Moreover, the pandemic is also expected to adversely impact the microalgae market in many countries globally, including the U.S., India, Australia, Brazil, and the EU-5 countries. Due to the countrywide lockdown in India, many commercial microalgae production and processing facilities have shut down or are operating at reduced capacities, leading to substantial losses in domestic microalgal production.

However, good nutrition intake is the top priority to maintain an optimal immune system, supporting the strong demand for plant and algae protein food products & beverages through e-commerce platforms. In addition, some of the algal protein products are considered to support the human immune system. According to various researches, spirulina inhibits influenza virus replication and reduces virus-induced mortality. For instance, according to the findings by immunologists at the University of California Davis School of Medicine, the addition of spirulina to cultured immune system cells significantly increased the production of infection-fighting cytokines. Besides, researchers at UC at Davis studying the effects of spirulina on both anemia and immune function found that spirulina, with its rich content of flavonoids and sulfalipids, modulates the production of cytokines and with its bioactive proteins stimulates the intestinal immune system to enhance the responsiveness to vaccines and improve allergic rhinitis.

Similarly, the chlorella market is experiencing a positive impact mainly due to the key role of chlorella in the immune health system. Chlorella is used as a healthy, natural, and sustainable superfood. During the pandemic, consumers demanded food ingredients that strengthened the immune and digestive systems. For this reason, microalgae/algae have been one of the superfood trends in Europe.

Thus, the demand for microalgal species, such as spirulina and chlorella, increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as the focus on the nutritional content increased. Despite the increase in demand, there were hindrances in the supply chain due to the lockdown imposed by governments in many countries.

Key Findings in the Microalgae Market Study

The microalgae market is segmented on the basis of distribution channel (consumer channel, business channel), type (Spirulina, Chlorella, Dunaliella Salina, Haematococcus Pluvialis, and other microalgae), and application (nutraceuticals, food & beverages, animal feed, cosmetics, and others). The study also evaluates industry competitors and analyzes the market at a regional and country level.

Based on type, Spirulina is estimated to account for the largest share of the overall microalgae market in 2021 owing to the rising health & wellness trends and dietary supplements industry; rising demand for natural food colors; growing vegetarianism; stringent regulations regarding the inclusion of synthetic colors and flavors; growing malnutrition; increasing preference for Spirulina-sourced products, especially Omega-3 fatty acids; growing use of Spirulina in aquaculture; increasing investments from leading color houses; and a growing number of products that include Spirulina as an ingredient.

Based on distribution channel, the microalgae market is mainly segmented into consumer (B2C) and business (B2B) channels. The business channel (B2B) segment is estimated to account for the larger share of the overall microalgae market in 2021. The large share of this segment is mainly attributed to the direct bulk purchasing of microalgae by manufacturers from various industries, such as nutraceuticals, food & beverage, and animal feed, for further product development.

Based on application, the B2B microalgae market is mainly divided into nutraceuticals, food and beverages, cosmetics, animal feed, and others. The nutraceuticals segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the overall microalgae market in 2021 due to the growing nutraceuticals sector, rising health concerns of the aging population in various countries, growing desire for natural alternatives to traditional pharmaceutical products, and increased awareness among consumers on the link between nutrition and health.

Geographically, North America is estimated to account for the largest share of the global microalgae market in 2021, followed by Asia-Pacific and Europe. The large share of this region is mainly attributed to the huge consumption of health supplements, strict regulations against the use of synthetic colors, growth of subsidiary industries like cosmetics and biofertilizers, increasing preference for natural protein sources, and presence of key algae biomass manufacturers with huge production capacities, especially in the U.S. However, Europe is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period, mainly due to the increased adoption of microalgae, especially spirulina and chlorella, in the manufacturing of therapeutic & nutritional products, growing reluctance towards the usage of synthetic colors, rising demand for natural blue colorants, and investments from leading color stakeholders in the phycocyanin space.

phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,"Here are the best vegetables for your health, according to nutritionists","It pays to love your veggies. Especially when you’re loading up on some of the healthiest in the vegetable kingdom. Read on for a list of nutritionist-approved go-to veggies to support good health.

1. Shiitake mushrooms

“Shiitake mushrooms are not only a low-calorie vegetable but have been shown to reduce inflammation and benefit immune function by increasing secretory IgA, which serves as the first line of defense in the body protecting us from pathogens,” says Erin Kenney, MS, RD, registered dietitian CEO of Nutrition Rewired. “Try throwing them into a stir-fry over rice.” We also love serving these tasty mushrooms as a side dish, sautéed with garlic and scallion.

2. Sweet potatoes

Already regularly eating this nutrient-dense and fiber-filled tuber? Keep it up. “Sweet potatoes are considered a functional food, as they contain many nutrients that human beings need for optimal health,” says Jared T. Meacham, Ph.D., RD, PMP, CSCS, president (2022-2023) DC Metro Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, noting that they are a source of both soluble and insoluble fiber. “These promote gut health by helping to clean the gastrointestinal tract while softening stool and helping to maintain a healthful internal environment,” Meacham explains. Additionally, sweet potatoes are a quality carbohydrate source, says Meacham, and one cup contains over half of a person’s recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin A, vitamin C, and manganese. “The antioxidants contained in sweet potatoes protect cells from damage and may have anti-cancer properties, specifically in colorectal cells,” he adds.

3. Jicama

“Jicama is a refreshing, crunchy vegetable that is rich in prebiotic fiber. Research has shown the type of fiber in jicama may prevent excessive blood glucose and body weight increase,” says Kenney, who suggests dicing this veggie into a salad or dipping it in hummus for a satisfying snack. The root veggie also makes a welcome addition to smoothies.

4. Green peas

Let’s hear it for these tiny green stars. “Green peas have a unique nutrient profile because they not only supply quality starchy carbohydrates but also provide a significant amount of fiber and protein, per serving, making them a highly nutritious source of these important nutrients,” says Meacham. “This is why pea protein supplementation is in such demand for both vegans and non-vegans looking for plant proteins to supplement their diet. Additionally, green peas contain saponins, which have been demonstrated to be effective at combating cancers. P.S. Frozen green peas are also affordable and keep in the freezer for a long time.”

5. Broccoli sprouts

“Broccoli sprouts release a phytochemical called sulforaphane which can help heal the gut, reduce inflammation, and could even help fight cancer by enhancing antioxidant activities,” says Kenney. “Sulforaphane has been shown to increase Phase II detoxification enzymes and/or antioxidant enzymes, which detoxify your body of potential carcinogens and other disease-causing compounds,” she continues, noting that it’s easy to grow your own broccoli sprouts at home. Throw them in a sandwich or a smoothie, she suggests.

6. Garlic

Part of the onion family, garlic may not be a boon for your breath, but it sure is one for your health. “Garlic is an amazing vegetable whose active ingredient, allicin, is the primary reason for its many healthful properties. Many of garlic’s most impactful health benefits center around its likely ability to help decrease LDL cholesterol while increasing HDL [or ‘good’] cholesterol,” comments Meacham. “Additionally, some research suggests that garlic contains properties that combat various kinds of cancer, with some research identifying liver cancer as a likely form of the disease that allicin may be effective in combating.” For what it’s worth, raw garlic contains more allicin than the cooked version, so try consuming it raw if you can, like minced into a salad dressing or a clove or two blended into a smoothie.

7. Kimchi

Pass the kimchi, please. “Kimchi, a fermented Korean vegetable mixture, has been shown to decrease levels of cholesterol in the body,” comments Kenney. “Fermented foods help to boost the beneficial bacteria in the gut, which has been shown to improve immune function.” The popular condiment tastes great in soups or mixed into savory entrée dishes. Buy it online or in the Asian foods section of your local grocer.

8. Beets

A bit messy, but well worth the cleanup. “Beets contain the antioxidant betalains, which give red beetroots their natural, vibrant red color. Beetroots are also a great source of vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin K, calcium and iron,” says Alyssa Burnison, MS, RD, LN, of ProfilePlan.com. “Given the antioxidant properties of betalains, they can protect our cells against DNA damage and provide anti-cancer properties,” she adds, pointing to this research.

9. Carrots

If you’re reading this and have baby carrots in your fridge, go ahead and grab a few to snack on right now. Mission accomplished? OK, great. “Carrots are commonly known for their rich sources of vitamin A and carotenoids, specifically beta-carotene,” says Burnison. “Your body converts the beta-carotene to vitamin A, which has been known to support immune function and eye health,” she says, highlighting this scientific review on carrots.

10. Brussels sprouts

“Brussels sprouts fall into the family of cruciferous vegetables and are a great source of vitamin C, vitamin K, soluble fiber and folate,” shares Burnison. “Soluble fiber, in particular, has been shown to help regulate blood sugar as it becomes a gel-like substance within the gut once digested. This can help prevent blood sugar spikes and decrease risk of type 2 diabetes.” Aarón Sánchez’s Brussels sprouts salad, anyone?

11. Spirulina

Bonus algae pick! It’s time to add this superfood to your diet: “Spirulina is technically a form of blue-green algae, but is often considered a ‘sea vegetable’ and is typically [sold in] powder form [for use in increasing] the nutrient profile of shakes and smoothies,” shares Meacham. You can also try sprinkling some into your favorite chia seed pudding or oatmeal preparation. “It packs a considerable amount of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds like C-phycocyanin (C-PC) in even the smallest serving,” says Meacham. “Spirulina supplementation has also been shown to help balance blood sugar and blood lipid profiles of people with Type 2 Diabetes. Likewise, spirulina has shown promise in research designed to determine its ability to combat oral cancer cells.”",,[]

phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,The Best Tranexamic Acid Products For Hyperpigmentation,"If you struggle at all with hyperpigmentation, chances are you’ve tried products with vitamin C or hydroquinone to reduce discoloration. Not knocking the efficacy of those ingredients here but there’s another player in the skincare game that might also hold the key to a more even complexion: tranexamic acid (or TXA for short). The ingredient is great at targeting hyperigmentation whether it be post-inflammatory or from melasma. The best part: It's very gentle and plays nicely with other ingredients—including actives that can be temperamental to mix with.



What is tranexamic acid?

“Tranexamic acid is an acid derived from a synthetic form of lysine,” says Dr. Farhaad Riyaz, a board-certified dermatologist and medical advisor for Docent, a prescription skincare brand. “In the skincare arena, it is used topically to treat hyperpigmentation, PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), and melasma (hormonally-induced hyperpigmentation).”

What does tranexamic acid do?

According to Dr. Riyaz, tranexamic acid attacks melanin production by inhibiting tyrosinase, the enzyme that’s responsible for pigmentation. “It does not exfoliate or stimulate collagen, so it is typically combined with other medications,” he adds. Specifically, tranexamic acid's mild enough to be used in conjunction with other brighteners like niacinamide and kojic acid as well as typically well-tolerated when combined with tretinoin and other active ingredients you may be using to target the signs of aging like fine lines and wrinkles.

How do you use tranexamic acid?

If you’re ready to give this new gentle but efficacious ingredient a try, Dr. Riyaz recommends looking for a serum, moisturizer, or peel with tranexamic acid in it. “The ideal concentration of tranexamic acid ranges from 3 to 5 percent, which is the amount proven to be effective in clinical studies,” he says. Typically, you can apply, say, a serum with tranexamic acid in it daily, morning or night, and even up to twice a day, but you should always start slow and patch test new products on your skin in an inconspicuous area first. According to Dr. Riyaz, tranexamic acid is suitable for all skin types and tones, and based on clinical trials, the only real side effects are dryness, irritation, and potentially a little flaking with use.

Can you use tranexamic acid if you're pregnant or breastfeeding?

For best results, keep these other tranexamic acid pointers in mind. “As with other ingredients and treatments for hyperpigmentation, daily use of a sunscreen with an SPF of 30+ is a must to help control hyperpigmentation,” says Dr. Riyaz. Also, because topical tranexamic acid hasn’t been studied in pregnant or breastfeeding women, you should always consult your dermatologist and obstetrician before beginning use in those cases. tranexamic acid can also be a great alternative for those sensitive to hydroquinone or anyone who wants to take a break from it for whatever reason. Just don’t expect an overnight change with tranexamic acid, and consistency is key. “Most people will notice results with consistent use in eight to 12 weeks,” says Riyaz.

Consider these five options, depending on your skincare needs and product preferences.",,"['Danielle Blundell', 'Danielle Blundell Is A New York City-Based Lifestyle Writer', 'Editor Who Has Written On Topics Ranging Home To Health For A Variety Of Publications Including Rachael Ray Every Day', 'Redbook', 'Family Circle', 'This Old House', 'Elle Decor', 'Esquire', 'Domino', 'Apartment Therapy.']"
phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,Patriot Rise Up Review: Safe Ingredients or Scam Supplement?,"Patriot Rise Up is a nutritional supplement composed of pure, organic spirulina designed to detoxify your body and to revitalize and re-energize your body.

According to the manufacturer, most of today’s most common health issues can be tied to big Pharma and Big Food, which are conspiring to keep us unhealthy and dependent on their products. Their union is what supposedly is causing the epidemic of diabetes, heart disease, and obesity facing the United States.

Taking spirulina can supposedly reverse the effects of the buildup of toxins in your body and help you restore and revitalize your health in just weeks. Conspiracy material and fancy marketing aside, what is spirulina, and can spirulina actually improve your health?

What Exactly is Patriot Rise Up?

As previously mentioned, Patriot Rise Up is a nutritional supplement composed of pure, organic spirulina powder. According to the manufacturer, taking Patriot Rise Up can reverse the toxic damage down to your body by Big Pharma and Big Food. In fact, they list a long number of potential benefits to spirulina and claim it can essentially transform your health in just weeks.

So what exactly is Spirulina?

Spirulina is a type of blue-green algae that grows in both fresh and saltwater. It’s also commercially produced for use in certain foods and supplements. It primarily grows in Mexico and Africa but is also produced in the United States and China.

The main buzz surrounding Spirulina is that it is one of the most nutritionally dense foods known to man. Gram for gram might be the most nutritionally dense food – even denser than moringa, spinach, or chlorella.

According to WebMD, just one single tablespoon of dried spirulina powder can provide you with:

Protein: 4 grams

Vitamin B1 (thiamine): 11% of the RDA

Vitamin B2 (riboflavin): 15% of the RDA

Vitamin B3 (niacin): 4% of the RDA

Copper: 21% of the RDA

Iron: 11% of the RDA

In addition to these vitamins and minerals, spirulina also contains significant amounts of magnesium potassium, and manganese, and a small number of dozens of other nutrients.

Potential Benefits of Patriot Rise Up

Patriot Rise Up does make a number of health claims about their product. However, as consumers have discovered before, there are plenty of supplement scams out there. So what does science say spirulina can do?

Spirulina has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties

Chronic inflammation can contribute to several diseases and conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, and even cancer. Spirulina is an excellent source of antioxidants, which can protect your body from oxidative damage.

The main active component in spirulina is phycocyanin, which gives spirulina its’ color. Several studies have found that phycocyanin can destroy free radicals and inhibit the production of inflammatory signaling molecules. This may help eliminate chronic inflammation and reduce pain and swelling that is associated with inflammation.

Spirulina can improve cholesterol levels and protect good cholesterol

Spirulina can positively impact cholesterol levels by reducing LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In one study, adults taking only one gram of spirulina reduced their triglyceride levels by 16.3% and bad LDL cholesterol by 10.1%.

Spirulina can also protect LDL cholesterol or bad cholesterol from oxidation. This process is a key driver in many serious diseases, particularly heart disease. In several human and animal studies, spirulina was effective at reducing lipid oxidation, which may reduce your risk of developing heart disease.

Spirulina may reduce blood pressure

Several studies have found that spirulina may reduce your blood pressure by increasing your body’s production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide signals your blood vessels to dilate or widen, improving blood flow and reducing your blood pressure.

Spirulina may improve muscle strength and endurance

According to two human studies, spirulina enhanced endurance and significantly increased the time it took for participants to become fatigued. It may be able to improve endurance and strength by reducing exercise-induced oxidative damage, which is a key contributor to muscle fatigue.

These are just a few of the proven benefits associated with spirulina. While there isn’t rock-hard evidence for all of the benefits made by Patriot Rise Up, many of the same benefits they claim their product has are backed by real, human studies.

Patriot Rise Up Side Effects

Since Patriot Rise Up only contains pure spirulina powder, it is very easy to determine how safe the product is. According to WebMD, spirulina is predominately safe and reasonably tolerated by most users. However, they do note there can be a few side effects.

While rare, spirulina has reportedly caused headaches, allergic reactions, muscle pain, sweating, and insomnia in some users. If you are allergic to seafood, seaweed, or other sea vegetables, you may potentially be at risk of developing an allergic reaction.

Likewise, if you have a thyroid condition, gout, kidney stones, or are pregnant or nursing, then Patriot Rise Up may not be right for you. Spirulina grown in China has also been known to absorb toxins known as microcystins, which can cause liver damage. Thankfully, Patriot Rise Up does not import their spirulina and therefore the risk for this is very low.

Overall, Patriot Rise Up is a predominately safe product that should not negatively impact your health. If for any reason you feel like the product may not be safe for you or that it may interfere with medication, then you should consult your medical doctor before buying Patriot Rise Up – or any spirulina supplement for that matter.

Is Patriot Rise Up Right for You?

Although Patriot Rise Up uses some flashy marketing and some fear-mongering to get its’ point across, there’s a lot to like about the product itself.

Spirulina is widely considered to be one of the few true “superfoods” out there, despite the fact the term is so widely used for virtually any nutritious food. There are plenty of verified benefits of taking spirulina that has been backed by actual science.

Truthfully, Patriot Rise Up may be of benefit to virtually everybody. However, based on the known benefits of spirulina, you may find this product especially useful if you meet certain criteria:

If you are suffering from high blood pressure, have uncontrollable blood sugar, or have high cholesterol

If you are an athlete or weightlifter looking to improve your strength and endurance

If you frequently suffer from anemia

If you suffer from allergic rhinitis

If you suffer from chronic inflammatory conditions like osteoarthritis

Even if you don’t fit any of these categories, Patriot Rise Up may still have plenty of benefits to you. Spirulina is a dense source of nutrition and has a variety of benefits to improve your overall health. Therefore, you may still want to use Patriot Rise Up to improve your overall health and wellness.

Advantages of Patriot Rise Up

Tacky marketing aside, Patriot Rise Up is a legitimate spirulina product with many proven benefits. If you’re still on the fence about whether or not this product is right for you, then consider the following:

The main ingredient spirulina is backed by dozens of studies

Spirulina has dozens of clinical trials to support the claims made by Patriot Rise Up. Spirulina can improve over a dozen different areas of your health and it is an excellent source of dozens of vitamins and minerals. All of these benefits are backed by real science too.

Patriot Rise Up is sourced and manufactured right here in the United States

The biggest problem with spirulina is that it is often sourced from China, which means the quality may be subpar. Even worse, toxins can attach themselves to spirulina during the growing process if proper quality controls aren’t used.

Thankfully, Patriot Rise Up is grown and manufactured right here in the United States under the strictest quality measures to ensure both the safety and effectiveness of Patriot Rise Up.

phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,8 Crucial Ingredients to Keep Up Your Protein Intake as a Vegan,"A well-balanced vegan diet can give you the fulfillment of making a positive impact on the world and may also allow you to live a longer and healthier life. Being vegan is associated with a wide variety of health benefits, including lower cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers, to name a few. However, one struggle many vegans face is getting enough protein in their diet. Protein is an essential component for almost every part of your body and to function at your absolute best Your skin, bones, muscles, and organs all depend on adequate amounts of protein to function as they are supposed to. Without meat and dairy products, vegans still need to consume sources of protein that contain essential amino acids.

Luckily, there are plenty of plant-based, ethical sources of protein that can help you thrive. Some of the most popular sources of protein for vegans come from nuts, nut butter, seeds, grains, soy products, and legumes. As a vegan, it’s essential to be conscious about getting in your “complete protein” (protein contains all the amino acids your body needs to help maintain your metabolism) every single day to feel and function at your best!

1. Oats

While oats are not a complete protein—meaning it doesn’t contain all nine of the essential amino acids, it’s still considered to be a great plant-based source of protein, especially for vegans. Raw oats especially contain a high amount of protein, with 13.2g per 100g. A cup of raw oats has 10.7g of protein. See our oats recipes for inspiration!

2. Seitan

Seitan, also known as wheat meat or wheat gluten is a meat substitute made from wheat gluten. Seitan’s high gluten content means that it is not suitable for people who are gluten intolerant or celiac. Seitan has 11.28g of protein per 100g, and it’s also a good source of selenium and contains small amounts of iron, calcium, and phosphorus. See our Seitan archives for plant-protein inspiration!

3. Lentils

Hemp seeds are a good source of protein, with 31.56g per 100g. These seeds are a complete source of protein, meaning that they provide all nine essential amino acids or building blocks for all proteins. Few plant-based foods are complete sources of protein, making hemp seeds a valuable addition to a vegetarian or vegan diet. With 25% of their calories coming from protein, just 30 grams of hemp seeds, or 2-3 tablespoons, contain around 11 grams of protein. See our hemp seed archives for recipe ideas!

5. Soybeans

The soybean is a legume, that grows in pods containing seeds (or “beans” as we call them). Soybeans are an excellent source of high-quality protein, which most legumes lack, making the soybean and its food products a superior protein source for people following a vegan diet. People use soybeans to make many products, such as tofu and tempeh. These products make protein-rich ingredients for many dishes. Soybeans themselves contain 12.95g of protein per 100g when raw, or 16.92g when cooked. Half a cup of raw soybeans has 16.6g of protein, whereas half a cup of cooked soybeans contains 15.65g of protein.

6. Spirulina

phycocyanin,spirulina phycocyanin,From Azores to Asia: Portuguese beauty brand Ignae eyeing region’s booming luxury niche beauty market,"The Portugese skin care company traces its roots back to 2009. It was founded by Miguel Pombo, who was previously working in the cosmetics industry dealing with regulation. Pombo, an Azores native, developed his range of skin care products inspired by the unique biodiversity of the archipelago.

The Azores are a collection of nine volcanic islands. With a subtropical climate and rich fertile soil, it is home to a unique assortment of flora, including Europe’s only tea plantations and rainforests.

“The first time I went to Azores, I was immediately struck – it’s like a paradise. Not only is it beautiful, but it has an amazing biological ecosystem. It has thermal water, tea plantations and rainforests. It’s really incredible,”​ said Claire Chung, CEO of Ignae.

The brand utilises a range of ingredients sourced from the Azores, including Japanese camillia, Japanese cedar, and phycocyanin extracted from spirulina.

Powering Ignae is the brand’s patent-pending EPC Factor Complex, which delivers the potent ingredients into the deeper layers of the skin.

“​With this technology, we're able to deliver them to the basal layer of the skin where they're most effective. Being able to use all the potential from these natural extracts in the high efficacy cosmetic products, this was the major breakthrough,” ​Pombo told CosmeticDesign-Asia.​

Utilising biotechnology enhances the efficacy of the active ingredients and also enables the company to develop its products with minimal impact on the ecosystem.

“Using this technology not only brings more efficacy in the products but also sustainability. It's something that's really important to us because this is something that we're going to take globally, and we can't be sucking up the resources of this rare paradise,” ​said Chung.

Chung, who spearheaded the launch of Net-A-Porter in China, joined the company in 2020 and immediately recognised the global potential for Ignae, especially in Asia.

“After living in China for so many years, you become really sensitive to ingredients. It’s really about the Azores; the plants and water are very mineral-rich. On top of having this amazing efficacy, there’s a real authentic story. Also, these products work really well on Asian skin, which is very critical.”​

The company first concentrated on establishing itself in the Western market but has no doubts that Asia is a “key market”.​

Today, Ignae is available online in Hong Kong where it has a local partner. This year, one of the markets it will focus on is China.

“China is exciting because it's such a huge market and the consumers are really hungry for newness, and they're also hungry for authentic stories and things associated with nature – just like the Korean island, Jeju, but Azores is a million times better,”​ said Chung.

It is currently available on multi-brand luxury e-retailer Ssence, which Chung said has a strong following among China’s millennial consumers.

Chung said the company’s goal is to establish a cross-border online channel by next year. At the same time, it is looking for a strategic partner or distributor in China.

In addition, the company also has its eye on the wider Asia region, including markets like Japan, Korea, and Singapore.",,['Amanda Lim']

phycocyanin,phycocyanin opinion,Sacrebleu! French brewers use algae to make blue beer,"By Ardee Napolitano

ROUBAIX, France – A French brewer has started using algae with a naturally-occurring pigment to turn their beer blue.

The beer, with the brand name “Line”, is the result of a tie-up between a firm that wants to popularise the algae as a dietary supplement, and a nearby craft brewery that was looking for a way to make its beverages more distinctive.

The beer is selling well, said Sebastien Verbeke, an employee of Hoppy Urban Brew, which makes the drink. “It’s getting an enormous amount of interest and curiosity on the part of the public,” he said.

The blue tint comes from spirulina, an algae that is grown in basins by a company called Etika Spirulina in northern France. The component of the spirulina that gives the blue colour, called phycocyanin, is then added to the beer during the brewing process.

Tasting a freshly produced bottle of the beer, brewery employee Mathilde Vanmansart described it as hoppy, light, and with fruity notes, while the only evidence of the added algae was the distinctive colour.

Xavier Delannoy, whose farm provides the spirulina, said after several test batches, the brewery had found a blend that appealed to customers.

He said 1,500 bottles of the blue beer were sold between October and December last year, and the brewery is now preparing to ramp up production to meet demand.",,[]
phycocyanin,phycocyanin textiles,Start-up ‘beats the blues’ with spirulina-based food colouring for hot and cold beverages,"The colour blue is rare in nature, and as such, the pigment has been highly sought after – in textiles and paints alike – for millennia.

An ‘eye-catching’ and ‘exciting’ colour, blue has also proved an attractive hue for food and beverage makers. In the drinks category, well-known blue drinks range from blue lagoon cocktails to berry-flavoured soft drinks, blue lattes and functional sports beverages.

As the clean label trend continues apace, consumers are increasingly looking to avoid artificial synthetic colorants. But in the blue category, whether synthetic or natural, Israeli start-up Gavan says both face the same problem.

“Both synthetic blue dyes and plant-based blue colouring have regulatory, stability, intensity, or price challenges,” ​explained Yael Leader, head of product for Gavan.

“The main barrier to creating food formulations with natural colours is stability – the ability to overcome formulation challenges and ensure vibrant and consistent true blue throughout the product’s shelf life.” ​

While delivering a health-stable, naturally derived, vibrant blue for products with low pH is ‘tricky’, as any heat treatment or shift in pH can influence the colour’s shade, Gavan believes it has found the solution in spirulina.

Phycocyanin pigment-protein​

A type of blue-green algae, spirulina contains a pigment-protein known as phycocyanin, which produces a pure blue colour.

Gavan’s proprietary, non-GMO technology extracts phycocyanin and optomises the colourant ‘gently, without damaging the source, and enables the extraction of multiple compounds from the whole spirulina, without waste.

The result is a stable, blue colourant developed from technology that protects it from fading, event at pH as low as 3.0 or when pasteurised at 90°C for 30 seconds, noted the start-up.

“In addition, the platform’s control over particle size offers improved stability throughout the final product’s shelf life.” ​

Fortified drink potential​

Gavan says its platform allows for a ‘full spectrum’ of stable shades of blue, but as blue is a primary colour, it also ‘opens a window’ to producing other colours, from non-chlorophyll green to purple shades.

The start-up’s natural colouring formulation can be used for hot beverages, such as tea and coffee, as well as functional drinks and sports drinks.

“We have experienced quite a hearty demand from companies who are saying their consumers are looking for new experiences They have expressed a desire to widen their colour palates and are becoming more adventurous,” ​Itai Cohen, CEO and co-founder of Gavan, told FoodNavigator.

“This has spurred a growing demand for natural colours, whether blue or green, primarily for categories like functional beverages such as sports drinks and energy drinks and even cocktails.” ​

However, within the functional beverage category, when a large amount of vitamins and minerals can be added, ingredients can react with pigments and accelerate the colour degradation process.

This can cause fading, or create a complex binding of pigments and minerals that can deposit sedimentation in the final application, we were told.

Gavan’s platform provides a solution for the fortified beverages sector, amongst others.

From a clean label perspective, the colourant is marked as ‘spirulina extract’ on ingredients lists. “It complies with FDA-21 CFR US code of federal regulation code title 21,” ​said Cohen.

“The colouring principle complies with section 75.530 spirulina extract.” ​",,['Flora Southey']
phycocyanin,phycocyanin cosmetics,Phycocyanin Pigment from Microalgae Biofilms Cultured on Wastewater,"New research published in Frontiers in Energy Research has demonstrated a process for cultivating microalgae biofilms in photobioreactors to produce these commercially important chemicals using wastewater.

Phycocyanin pigments are vital for multiple industries, having various important commercial applications. Producing them from gas and oil wastewater presents a sustainable waste valorization process that fits the aims of the circular economy concept.

Phycocyanin

Phycocyanin, along with allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin, is a pigment-protein complex. It is a water-soluble light-harvesting phycobiliprotein with a characteristic light blue color and is an accessory pigment to chlorophyll. Phycocyanins are produced by cyanobacteria.

There are numerous commercial and scientific uses of phycocyanin. It is used as a natural food coloring, in nutritional supplements (for example, spirulina,) as a coloring in cosmetics, and as fluorescent markers in immunological assays. It is also used in animal feeds and aquaculture. Additionally, it contains anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and antiviral properties, making it an attractive target for therapeutics and drugs within the biomedical industry.

Using Petrochemical Wastewater for Microalgae Culture

The petrochemical industries produce large volumes of wastewater globally as a result of oil and gas extraction. Over 90% is re-injected into formations or disposal wells for recovery. Treatment ponds are used to store most of the remaining wastewater. If disposed of untreated into the environment, wastewater can cause significant levels of pollution, affecting vulnerable ecosystems.

Using produced wastewater for the cultivation of algae is a huge opportunity for the valorization of waste streams in the oil and gas industries. This can be used for nutrient recovery, with the biomass used for beneficial purposes. A 2017 study has found that whilst produced wastewater has high salinity and organic compounds that are detrimental for algae growth, important inorganic nutrients which microbes use for growth are present, which is advantageous. Produced wastewater can therefore be used as a culture medium.

Additionally, there are indications that using produced wastewater for microalgal cultivation can be used for biofuel production as well as microbial wastewater treatment. Another recent study has demonstrated the possibility of utilizing microalgal cultivation for nutrient removal.

The majority of current investigations into using produced wastewater as a microalgae cultivation medium have focused on using microalgal biofilms for biofuel production. Conversely, there is limited research into the production of valuable bioproducts. Integrating side streams of valuable bioproducts into processes using microalgal biorefineries could help reduce the costs associated with microalgal wastewater treatment and biofuel production.

The recovery of phycobiliproteins such as phycocyanin and their derivative products can be easily integrated into microalgae biorefinery operations, and the water solubility of phycobiliproteins means that they do not interfere with the recovery of denser liquids. Thus, integrating them into these operations can optimize operations and add value to them.

Suitable substrates for microalgae biofilm growth have been identified in the current literature, with over 15 different materials so far explored. Cotton-based materials have been identified as the best-performing options.

The Study

The main purpose of the new study published online in Frontiers in Energy Research is to evaluate the influence of growth materials and light intensity in a rotating algae biofilm reactor on phycocyanin production. LLC2, a strain of cyanobacteria, was chosen for its ability to form biofilms in different light and substrate conditions. High levels of turbidity and good solid biomass production were identified as key factors in the choice of the reactor for the study.

The team constructed a 2000-liter outdoor-produced water pond at Utah State University. The pool was operated between August and September due to favorable outdoor temperature and the pond was shaded to control light intensity. Out of the materials tested for biofilm growth substratum, the cotton rope was identified as the best option.

Amongst the experimental observations in the study, low light LLC2 biofilms produced twice the amount of phycocyanin per biomass yield compared to high light biofilms. An accompanying crude extract purity (just above the benchmark standard for food-grade phycocyanin) was observed. The authors concluded that different production goals could be achieved by adjusting the light level for biofilm culture.

Based on their experimental observations, the authors have stated that future studies should concentrate on producing other high-value products from microalgae cultures in produced wastewater. Additionally, amongst other future research directions suggested in the study, the potential value of cyanobacteria biofilms to produce valuable bioproducts such as fertilizer, feed, biofuels, and biogas should be assessed in studies.

Algenist has launched the Blue Algae Vitamin C Skinclarity Brightening Serum, featuring its Blue Algae Vitamin C, an L-ascorbic acid made from regenerative spirulina blue-green algae.

The unique form of vitamin C is said to help visibly restore skin clarity and improve skin texture in 10 days.

Skinclarity Brightening Serum is also formulated with Algenist's patented Alguronic Acid to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles; a marine ferment to help improve the appearance of skin texture and hydrate skin; a moisturizing complex that combines hyaluronic acid and Alguronic Acid to help provide a clinically measured increase in skin hydration; and tansy extract to help condition and soothe skin.

The vegan product is said to target the appearance of pigmentation, appearing most prominently in the fair and deep complexions as dark spots, uneven tone and texture, and overall dullness.

The serum retails for $72 at the brand's site and at Sephora.

Tammy Yaiser, VP product development, said: ""The team was inspired by the extensive research on blue-green algae, and for the potential to derive, extract and isolate its naturally-occurring vitamin C component and then to regeneratively produce it in a lab. The spirulina is sustainably grown, and the naturally-occurring vitamin C component is isolated and concentrated. The result is a highly pure ascorbic acid raw material, identified simply on the ingredient list as 'ascorbic acid.' What's also exciting about the process is that the leftover algae by-product is still rich in nutrients and can be beneficial for other applications such as fermentation, agricultural fertilizers and wastewater remediation. A part of the leftover biomass is used for making spirulina extract and spirulina oil. We considered the whole process.""

CEO Rose Fernandez, said: ""When we set out to solve a problem in 10 days with each of our formulas, the process is rigorous. If an ingredient or technology does not exist to help deliver on our promise of 10-day results, or if we see a way to re-envision traditional methods ingredients are made to elevate our commitment to high-performance, naturally-sourced and more sustainably-produced ingredients—we will make our own. This is how the brand was born and proudly continues today. Today we have consumers searching for vitamin C at high rates. This inspired us to develop a naturally-derived, potent vitamin C from a bold, blue spirulina. In our scientific study, our new Blue Algae Vitamin C outperformed other commonly used forms of vitamin C and other brightening ingredients specifically used for targeting pigmentation that we tested. No surprise given our reputation. This coupled with the fact that there was an opportunity to develop a new vitamin C serum actually clinically studied on melanin-rich skin—who can experience skin sensitivity, blotchiness or even products that simply don't work.""

phycocyanin,phycocyanin dye,Scientists unlocking secret of phycocyanin instability for vivid blues,"Phycocyanin is a food colourant that provides a vivid blue pigment. However, it has a drawback: it can prove unstable when used in formulations like soft drinks and sports beverages, losing its hues under fluorescent light on the grocery store shelf.

Scientists at Cornell University say they have found the reason for this unique behaviour ‘with the help of physics’ and the ‘bright X-ray beams’ from the University’s synchrotron.

“Phycocyanin has a vibrant blue colour,”​ said Alireza Abbaspourrad, assistant professor of food chemistry and ingredient technology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “However, if you want to put phycocyanin into acidified beverages, the blue colour fades quickly due to thermal treatment.”​

Now, they believe they have the opportunity to stabilise it, according to new research published in the American Chemical Society’s journal BioMacromolecules​.

The research, ‘Tuning C-Phycocyanin Photoactivity via pH-Mediated Assembly–Disassembly​’, was authored by Ying Li, a doctoral student in food science; Richard Gillilan, staff scientist at the Macromolecular X-ray science at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source; and Abbaspourrad.

Protein structure and colour stability

Most food companies seeking blues in their food use synthetic food dye, Abbaspourrad said.

Phycocyanin is derived from algae and as such it represents a natural and more nutritional protein that could help food and beverage manufacturers meet growing demand for clean label, natural products. The food scientists therefore set out to understand its colour properties and how it worked.

To achieve this, the researchers partnered with the Macromolecular Diffraction Facility of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) and used Size-Exclusion Chromatography coupled to Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SEC−SAXS) on a beamline.

Phycocyanin was placed into a biological fluid and brought to the MacCHESS laboratory. There, intense beamline X-rays were channelled into tiny drops of the fluid. The small-angle X-ray scattering showed that as pH levels, the molecular strands changed into different shapes, folds and assemblies.

“As pH changes, the phycocyanin molecules form in different ways. If the pH goes up, the molecules come together and if the pH level goes down, the molecules disassemble,”​ explained Li.

“As we changed the environmental stimulus for the phycocyanin, the molecules modulate their behaviour in terms of how they interact with light. It's a relationship of the protein structure and the colour stability.”​

The acidity of the environment can essentially mediate an assembly-disassembly pathway, Abbaspourrad said. “Through the X-ray scattering we could see the proteins and see how their monomers are assembled together and how the oligomers disassemble. That’s the root cause for how the blue colour fades,”​ he explained.

“We have experienced quite a hearty demand from companies who are saying their consumers are looking for new experiences They have expressed a desire to widen their colour palates and are becoming more adventurous,” ​Itai Cohen, CEO and co-founder of Gavan, told FoodNavigator.

“This has spurred a growing demand for natural colours, whether blue or green, primarily for categories like functional beverages such as sports drinks and energy drinks and even cocktails.” ​

However, within the functional beverage category, when a large amount of vitamins and minerals can be added, ingredients can react with pigments and accelerate the colour degradation process.

This can cause fading, or create a complex binding of pigments and minerals that can deposit sedimentation in the final application, we were told.

Gavan’s platform provides a solution for the fortified beverages sector, amongst others.

From a clean label perspective, the colourant is marked as ‘spirulina extract’ on ingredients lists. “It complies with FDA-21 CFR US code of federal regulation code title 21,” ​said Cohen.

“The colouring principle complies with section 75.530 spirulina extract.” ​",,['Flora Southey']

Analyses of tumor weight, tumor inhibitory rate, and organ index

The tumor volume growth curves are shown in Fig. 2. The tumor growth rate in the model group was more than 2.6 cm3 on Day 15. In contrast, CTX-treated and all EPA-treated groups showed obvious inhibition of tumor growth.

Figure 2 The effects of EPA on tumor H22 tumor-bearing mice. Full size image

The organ index, tumor weight, and tumor inhibitory rate (TIR) are shown in Table 2. The CTX-treated group exhibited the highest TIR (92.42%). Moreover, the tumor weight in the EPA-treated groups significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, with tumor inhibitory rates of 79.70%, 84.55%, and 87.28%. The spleen and thymus indices were significantly lower in the CTX-treated group than in the normal group, and the thymus was severely atrophic (p < 0.05). The EPA-treated groups showed significant improvements, and there was a protective effect on the spleen and thymus.

Analysis of the expression of serum cytokines and VEGF in mice

ELISA was used to investigate the effects of EPA on serum cytokine production, including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, AST, BUN, and IL-6, in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Angiogenesis has become an important therapeutic target for many tumors and is an essential process for tumor growth and metastasis10,16.

As shown in Fig. 3, compared with the levels in the normal and model groups, the serum levels of IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α significantly increased in the EPA-treated HD group (p < 0.05). VEGF levels were significantly decreased in the CTX-treated and EPA-treated groups. The AST and BUN levels in the model group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group (p < 0.05). The values of these two parameters significantly decreased in the EPA-treated groups compared to those in the model control group (p < 0.05). The AST levels of mice in the CTX-treated group were significantly higher than those of the model group (p < 0.05).

Morphological analysis after treatment with EPA

Histopathology was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the tumor. As shown in Fig. 4A, tumor cell in the model group s were plump and intact, with large nuclei. After treatment with EPA and CTX, the tumor cells exhibited a large necrotic region and were stained darker, which indicates that the significant antitumor efficacy of EPA in H22 tumor-bearing mice involved inducing cell death.

Figure 4 Histological examination of the morphological changes in tumors from H22-bearing mice. Tumor tissues stained with H&E (A) (400 ×) TUNEL assay (400 ×) (B,C). Full size image

The TUNEL assay results are shown in Fig. 4B,C, and cells with brown granules were considered positively stained10,17. The percentage of positive cells in the model group was 5%; therefore, the amount of tumor cell apoptosis was minimal. However, the CTX-treated group exhibited the highest percentage of positive cells (44%). The EPA-treated groups showed an increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, with values of 12%, 28%, and 42%. Moreover, the mice in the HD and EPA-treated group showed a positive cell percentage similar to that of the CTX-treated group.

Effects of EPA on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and VEGF

Based on the results of previous studies18, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the proapoptotic factor BAX, the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase 3 to determine the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, as shown in Fig. 5. BAX and cleaved caspase 3 expression intensities increased, while Bcl-2 expression decreased in the EPA-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the ratio of Bcl-2 to BAX decreased significantly. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level in the EPA-treated groups significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and VEGF expression was lowest in the CTX-treated group.

Figure 5 Immunohistochemical anylisis of tumor tissues and stained area of tumor tissues. Full size image

In addition, western blotting was used to analyze the expression of Bcl-2, BAX, cleaved caspase 3, and VEGF. As shown in Fig. 6, all EPA-treated groups showed increased BAX and cleaved caspase 3 protein expression and decreased Bcl-2 and VEGF protein expression; these results were consistent with the results of the immunohistochemical analysis. However, the expression of PI3K/AKT and p-AKT/AKT increased in a dose-dependent manner in the EPA-treated group.

Results of the rank-abundance curves of microorganisms in samples

The rank-abundance curve is a method used to analyze the diversity of microorganisms. In this study, the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) rank-abundance curves showed the diversity in the samples, which can be explained by species richness and evenness19. In the horizontal direction, the wider the span of the curve is, the richer the species rank of the microorganism sample20. The OTU rank-abundance curve in this study showed that the abundance distribution of the samples was even, as it was flat and smooth in the vertical direction (Fig. 7). The richness and evenness of the samples shown in the rank-abundance curve indicate that the diversity of the samples was rational and reasonable.

Dilution curves of microorganisms in the gut microbiota

The dilution curve was used to evaluate whether the sample sequencing depth was sufficient to cover all species of microbes and compare species richness among different sequenced samples. A flat curve indicates that the sequencing data are reasonable and reflect the structure of the entire community21. The number of sequences reached 5000, and the curves were in the plateau stage (Fig. 8). Therefore, the experimental data were deemed reasonable and reliable.

Species accumulation curves of the gut microbiota

The species accumulation curve is used to describe the increase in species with the increase in the number of samples and is an effective tool for investigating the composition and predicting the abundance of species in samples. This curve reflects whether the number of samples was sufficient. In this study, we mainly observed the end of the curve; if it showed a sharp upward trend, the number of samples was considered insufficient, while if the end of the curve tended to be flat, the number of samples was considered sufficient22. The end of the species accumulation curves of Specaccums tended to be flat in this study; therefore, the sampling was considered sufficient to carry out data analysis (Fig. 9).

Results of alpha diversity analysis of the gut microbiota

In this study, six indicators, including the Chao1 index, observed species index, PD_whole_tree index, goods-coverage index, Shannon index, and Simpson's index, were analyzed to assess the species diversity of individual samples (Fig. 10). There was no significant difference in flora abundance or diversity between the normal, model, and HD groups in the EPA-treated group.

Results of beta diversity analysis of the gut microbiota

Beta diversity analysis was used to compare the differences in species diversity among intergroup samples, and the evolutionary distance between species was considered while calculating the results. The higher the index value, the greater the difference between the samples. In this study, the UniFrac results were divided into two parts: the weighted UniFrac, which considered the abundance of the sequence, and the unweighted UniFrac, which did not consider the abundance of the sequence. According to the statistical analysis of the differences of the clustered samples, the similarity of species composition among the samples was determined by calculating the distance between the samples23.

ANOSIM similarity analysis was used to determine the intergroup and intragroup differences, and the grouping was found to be meaningful (Fig. 11). The R value of the unweighted results was R = 0.34 > 0 and p = 0.001 < 0.05, indicating that the differences between the groups were significantly greater than those within the group (intragroup). Therefore, the result is reasonable, and the data are statistically significant. Thus, in this study, the gut microbiota in tumor-bearing mice tended to be normal after EPA treatment.

Figure 11 Anosim analysis of gut microbiota based on unweighted unifrac distance. Full size image

Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was used to evaluate the differences between samples (Fig. 12)24. If the samples were in close proximity, the species compositions of the samples were similar. The EPA-treated group was closer in distance to the normal group, indicating that both groups had similar gut microbiotas.

Difference Analysis of the Gut Microbiota

To emphasize the statistical significance and biological relevance, the LEFse analysis of the gut microflora was performed, and the results are presented quantitatively in an LDA Score column and a cladogram. This study aimed to estimate the impact of the abundance of each component and identify the significant difference effect on the division of samples23. The results showed significant differences in the gut microflora, such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Streptococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Alistipes (Nor), Campylobacterales, Epsilonproteobacteria, Helicobacteraceae, Helicobacter, Escherichia_Shigella, Subdoligranulum (Mod), Prevotellaceae, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidaceae, Bacteroides, and Selenomonadales (EPA) (Figs. 13 and 14).

Species abundance in the gut microbiota

Histograms showing species profiling in the gut microflora of each sample were used to identify the species with higher relative abundances and individual samples at different classification levels (Fig. 15A and Table 3)25. In this study, the phylum level showed that Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Proteobacteria accounted for more than 98% of the total microflora after the different treatments. Compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes decreased, but Proteobacteria increased in the model group. In contrast, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes increased, but Proteobacteria decreased in the EPA-treated group and was close to that in the normal group. Thus, the trend in the two phyla in the microflora in the EPA-treated group trended more toward that in the normal group.

Table 3 The relative abundance of the main gut microbiota at the phylum level in four groups. Full size table

Figure 15B shows the genus level of the gut microflora in the three groups. Based on abundance, the main groups were Lactobacillus, Bacteroidales_S24 − 7_group_norank, Bacteroidales, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 001, Alloprevotella, Streptococcus, Alistipes, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 003, and Helicobacter. Based on the changing trend in the abundance of the gut microflora, it can be concluded that tumor-bearing mice that were treated with EPA tended to be closer to those in the normal control group. Compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of beneficial microflora such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroidales_S24 − 7_group_norank, Bacteroidales, Alloprevotella and Alistipes in the model group decreased by 6.95%, 25.25%, 4.67%, 2.65%, and 0.68%, respectively; accordingly, compared with those in the model group, those in the EPA group increased by 10.67%, 19.94%, 1.34%, and 3.29%, respectively, which showed a significant reversion in the reduction in beneficial microflora in the model group. In contrast, compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of the harmful microflora Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 001, Helicobacter, and Prevotellaceae_UCG − 003 in the model group increased to 16.39%, 7.01%, 5.83%, and 8.81%, respectively, while those in the EPA-treated group decreased to 17.99%, 1.44%, 5.81%, and 3.33%, respectively. These results showed that EPA treatment balanced the relative abundance of beneficial and detrimental bacteria in the gut microflora, as observed in the normal group.",,"['Wang', 'Academy Of Traditional Chinese Medicine', 'Jilin Agricultural Science', 'Technology University', 'Jilin', 'Academy Of Medical', 'Changchun Sci-Tech University', 'Changchun', 'Zhang', 'Liu']"

phycocyanin,phycocyanin dye,University of Calgary researchers discover a green way to make natural blue dye,"At first, researchers Agasteswar Vadlamani and Angela Kouris were trying to find ways to produce carbon-neutral gas with organisms unique to British Columbia's Soda Lakes.

But instead, the microbial goo lead the team to a business opportunity: a natural way to create blue colourant. It's food-safe, could have health benefits and, best of all, removes CO2 from the atmosphere.

It all started with a bit of a eureka moment, when Vadlamani saw the bacteria in their lab pond was emitting a beautiful blue colour — phycocyanin. So, he approached the research team, urging them to switch gears.

""I mean, that is just like a single aha moment,"" he said. ""I realized that focusing on this has better value proposition compared to bioenergy.""

That's when they created their company: Synergia Biotech. From thereon in, the team threw themselves into commercialization — an unexpected but exciting pivot.

""That's what drives me every day,"" Vadlamani said. ""We are always excited about new discoveries, it feels great.""

Typically, Kouris said, the blue dye you see in food, wine and blue jeans is created by the same synthetic process.

There are studies showing these dyes aren't the best for your health and can be carcinogenic. Finding blue in naturally-occurring settings, she added, is quite rare.

The researchers used a biological process in a pond at the University of Calgary campus to test the concept. (Katy Whitt Photography)

The most exciting part of the process, Kouris said, is that it's environmentally friendly.

Their production harnesses a naturally-occurring bacteria known as cyanobacteria — with a little sunlight, and drawing from CO2 in the air, they are able to harvest and concentrate the blue colour into a powder.

""We're the only company, the only innovation out there that has found a way to produce phycocyanin by capturing carbon in the atmosphere,"" Kouris said. ""All other technologies rely on carbon intensive processes.""

With their model, Kouris said they also see a new revenue stream in the Canadian agricultural field.

Right now, a big obstacle is scaling up, so the company is building a facility to help up production which should be ready to go in 2022.",,[]

phycocyanin,phycocyanin dye,‘We will yield the full yellow-to-purple spectrum’: Precision fermentation food colours prepare to challenge synthetics,"Founded in 2018 by biotechnology entrepreneurs Halim Jubran and Tal Zeltzer, Israeli start-up Phytolon is on a mission to ‘revolutionise’ the natural colours industry.

Rather than source natural colours from fruits, vegetables, and plants, or make synthetic colours from petrochemical sources, Phytolon is turning to precision fermentation.

The result is a range of stable natural colours covering the full yellow-to-purple spectrum.

Precision fermentation-derived betalain pigments​

To date, hundreds of artificial food dyes have been developed by converting petrochemicals, via synthetic chemistry, into a wide range of colours.

As consumers increasingly seek out more sustainable and ‘natural’ products, Phytolon is responding with solutions that offer equivalent pigment vibrancy, but which come from biological – rather than petrochemical – sources.

The start-up has developed a patented process for producing betalain pigments through precision fermentation of certain yeast strains. The process, it says, is as simple as brewing.

What are betalains? They are natural pigments responsible for colouring some of the most vibrant plants on the planet, for example in beetroot and cactus fruit. The water-soluble pigments retain colour stability at wide pH range, as well as when exposed to heat and light.

In leveraging precision fermentation technology, Phytolon is also working to disrupt the natural colours sector, which relies on pigments derived from fruits, vegetables, and plants.

The start-up’s novel production technology requires less land use, water use, and has a reduced carbon footprint compared to conventional natural pigment manufacture, Phytolon suggested.

Relevant food applications include products in the frozen category. GettyImages/LauriPatterson

The uniqueness of Phytolon’s technology, according to co-founder and CEO Halim Jubran, is that once the colours are produced in the cells of the yeast, the colours are ‘spontaneously’ released out of the cells – resulting in cell-free and DNA-free pure natural colours.

This means that they qualify for GMO-free classification in the US and Europe, we were told.

“Phytolon’s colours were demonstrated as highly compatible with alternative meat and dairy in terms of colouring performance,” ​Jubran told FoodNavigator. “Also, Phytolon’s offering goes in harmony with the offering of these innovative markets in terms of sustainability.” ​

Phytolon partners with Ginkgo Bioworks​

To take Phytolon’s innovation to the ‘next level’, the start-up has announced a collaboration with US biotech Ginkgo Bioworks, a leading horizontal platform for cell programming.

Under the partnership, Phytolon will leverage Ginkgo’s ability to engineer biology at scale, and work together to produce vibrant cultured food colours via yeast fermentation.

“The collaboration will yield production of the full yellow to purple spectrum, including all yellows, oranges, reds, pinks, and purple, in accordance with Phytolon’s IP for commercial use of bio-produced betalain colours,” ​explained Jubran.

“This spectrum covers 75% of the market demand for food colours.” ​

Phytolon's colours can also be used in bakery and confectionery, amongst other applications. GettyImages/mtreasure

Jubran’s co-founder and Phytolon CTO Dr Tal Zeltzer, said the start-up was ‘excited’ to work with Ginkgo to develop natural colours that have the potential to outperform conventional artificial dyes in cost and performance.

“We believe biotechnology makes it possible to produce a wider range of colours than ever before that may outperform current benchmark colourants, and we look forward to building products that may meet and even exceed consumer expectations for healthier, sustainable foods, all the while aiming to maintain industry requirements for high quality and cost-efficiency.” ​

From Gingko’s perspective, the biotech is looking forward to helping Phytolon ‘challenge industry norms’ and ‘attempt to build a fundamentally better product’ than what’s on the market today.

“The planet needs new sustainable solutions, and we are excited to partner with Phytolon to support a more sustainable food system,” ​said Jennifer Wipf, head of commercial, cell engineering, at Ginkgo Bioworks.

Preparing for 2023 launch​

Phytolon is expecting its precision fermentation derived colours to reach the market next year, in 2023. Relevant food applications include meat, plant-based meat, bakery, confectionery, dairy, frozen and confectionery.

How will these pigments appear on ingredients labels? FoodNavigator asked CEO Jubran: “The colours can be called, for instance, ‘fermented betelain colours’, or ‘betelains from fermentation’.​

“Most importantly, they will still qualify the ‘natural’ label and/or the non-synthetic label of food products that they dye.” ​",,['Flora Southey']
phycocyanin,phycocyanin dye,Why This Blue Beer Has Major Health Benefits,"Unlike the green beer swilled by the masses on St. Patrick's Day, which uses green food dye, Line's bluish tint is caused by the pigment phycocyanin found in the blue-green algae known as spirulina, according to Food & Wine. Like its green counterpart, the blue color doesn't impact the beer's flavor in any discernible way. It is made in the style of a session IPA, producing notes of citrus and a slight hoppiness.

Since it contains spirulina, the beer provides a number of potential health benefits, and clocking in at a modest 3% ABV (Alcohol by Volume), you're unlikely to get inebriated if you indulge in one or two. This particular type of algae, which is available in dietary supplements, is packed with protein and rich in vitamins, according to Medical News Today. A series of studies published through the National Library of Medicine have indicated that spirulina also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help strengthen the immune system.

Blue-green algae is often labeled a superfood as well, although this is not a medical or scientific term and can sometimes be associated with product marketing hype. Regardless, spirulina is nutrient-dense and low in calories, so ""To your health"" just might prove a fitting toast for those raising a glass of this quirky blue beer.",,['Colin Mccandless']
phycocyanin,phycocyanin dye,In vitro and in vivo anti-cancer effects of hibernating common carp (Cyprinus carpio) plasma on metastatic triple-negative breast cancer,"Preparation of the fish for hibernation

All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Isfahan (IR.UI.REC.1398.072). Alive adult common carps (mean weight: 1670 ± 240 g, mean length: 34.4 ± 7.9 cm) were purchased from a local fish farm in Isfahan provenance, Iran. They were placed in a 200-L plastic tank with circulating aerated water (Temperature: 20 °C, Flow rate: 500 L/h, Dissolved oxygen: > 5 mg/L) for one month. After acclimation period, the fish were randomly divided into two groups including non-hibernating and hibernating. Non-hibernating fish were kept in the same containers and conditions (Temperature: 20 °C). The hibernation protocol was done according to previous studies13,26,50. The fish were induced into a hibernated state by gradient cooling of water at the rate of 1–2 °C until 3 °C in water tanks located in a temperature-controlled cold room and maintained at this temperature during the winter. Then, we separately put the fish of each groups in a water tank containing eugenol (4-allyl-2 methoxy phenol, the active component of clove oil, 40 mg/L) to anesthetize them. Anesthesia of fish is characterized by the complete loss of balance, immobility, and failure to respond to strong external stimuli, such as intense touch and vibration of the tail area51. The fish were anesthetized by eugenol (40 mg/L) and blood was collected from the caudal vasculature. Subsequently, plasma was isolated, separately pooled together for each group, lyophilized and stored at -80° C for further use.

Cell culture

The murine triple-negative mammary cancer (4T1) and normal murine fibroblast (L929) cell lines were obtained from the Pasteur Institute (Tehran, Iran). 4T1 and L929 cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at standard cell culture condition (37 °C, 5% CO2).

MTT assay

The cell viability of 4T1 and L929 cells was evaluated using MTT (3-(4 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Briefly, cells were allowed to grow to 80% confluency. The cells were detached using 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution (GIBCO, USA) and seeded in 96-well culture plates at density of 5 × 103 cells/well. After 24 h incubation, different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 mg/ml) of lyophilized plasma of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp dissolved in culture medium were added to each wells. After 24, 48, and 72 h of cells seeding in 96 -well plate, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then media were replaced with a basal culture medium containing 0.005% MTT solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). After 4 h incubation (37 °C, 5% CO2) in the dark, the medium was discarded and the precipitated formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Finally, the absorbance of each well was detected by an Absorbance Microplate Reader (BioTek-ELX800, USA) at the wavelength of 570 nm. According to the following equation, the percentage of cell viability was calculated by relative value to the untreated cells (0 mg/ml) as the control group. The experiment was repeated three times and at least six wells were used for each concentration.

$$ Cell \,Viablity\, \left( \% \right) = \frac{{\left( {OD \,Sample - OD \,Blank} \right)}}{{\left( {OD \,Control - OD \,Blank} \right)}} \times {1}00 $$

Morphological assessment

4T1 and L929 cells were separately seeded in 6-well culture plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h. Then, the wells were washed three times with PBS (Sigma, USA). An inverted phase-contrast light microscope (Olympus, Japan) was used to capture photographs before treatment. Then, the wells were divided into three groups including control, hibernating plasma, and non-hibernating plasma. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group, while the cells of hibernating plasma group were treated with the optimal hibernating plasma concentration selected from the MTT assay (16 mg/ml). The same concentration of non-hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) was used to treat the cells of hibernating plasma group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. After 24 h, the wells were washed three times with PBS and microscopic photographs were captured to evaluate changes in cellular morphology.

Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining assay

The dual-fluorescent AO/EB staining assay was used to evaluate the cell viability as well as apoptosis. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with the optimal hibernating and non-hibernating plasma concentration (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. Then, the wells were washed three times with PBS and stained with 100 µl AO/EB mixture solution containing 100 µg/ml acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 100 µg/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in PBS for 30 min in the dark. Finally, an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan) was used to capture images.

Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) staining assay

Apoptosis rate was determined by the apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences, USA) according to previous study52. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a concentration of 1 × 105 and incubated overnight. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 16 mg/ml hibernating plasma or the same concentration of non-hibernating plasma for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. The cells were detached and washed three times with cold PBS (1X, pH 7.4) and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min. Then, the cells were resuspended in binding buffer (100 µl), stained with 5 µl of Annexin V-FITC and the same volume of PI, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Subsequently, the volume of each sample was increased to 500 μl by adding binding buffer and the cells were immediately analyzed (104 cells/sample) using flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, USA). This experiment was independently repeated three times and the obtained data were analyzed by the FlowJo-V10 software.

Cell cycle analysis

The Tali™ cell cycle kit (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, USA) was performed to determine the percentage of cells at each stage of the cell cycle. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 and incubated overnight. Subsequently, the cells were treated with hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) or non-hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. After that, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice with cold PBS. Then, they were fixed with dropwise addition of 70% ice-cold ethanol (1 ml) while gentle vortexing and stored at -20 °C overnight. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min. Then, the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of Tali™ cell cycle solution. Finally, it was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The DNA content of stained cells was analyzed using flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, USA) for each sample. This experiment was independently repeated three times and the results were displayed as histograms. The obtained data were analyzed by the FlowJo-V10 software.

Wound healing assay

The wound healing (or scratch) assay was carried out for cell migration analysis. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates and incubated for 48 h to grow to 80% confluency. Then, the cell layer was scratched by a sterile P200 Micropipette tip. The wells were washed twice with PBS to remove the debris and smoothing the edges of the scratch. Next, the cells were incubated with RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.5% FBS and treated with the optimal hibernating or non-hibernating plasma concentration (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. The photographs were obtained from the selected regions using an inverted phase-contrast light microscope (Olympus, Japan) at 0 h (immediately after media replacement) and 24 h after treatment with hibernating and non-hibernating plasma. The Wound Healing Size Tool, as an ImageJ/Fiji1 plugin, was used to quantifying the wound area53. The following equation was used to calculate the wound closure percentage.

$$ Wound\; closure\, \% = \left. {\left( {\frac{Initial\; wound\; area - Final\; wound\; area }{{Initail\; wound\; area}}} \right.} \right) \times 100 $$

Cancer cells implantation and tumor challenge

All animal experiments and procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Isfahan (IR.UI.REC.1398.072). A total of 54 female Balb/c mice (mean weight: 23 ± 2 g) were purchased from the Royan Institute of Isfahan, Iran. The mice were housed in standard cages with controlled temperature (24 ± 2 ºC), relative humidity (50 ± 10%), 12-h light–dark cycle, and ad libitum access to enough food and water. It should be mentioned that standardized humane endpoints based on the current guidelines for endpoints in animal tumor studies were used54,55,56. After two weeks of acclimation, the mice's belly hair was shaved and disinfected with 70% alcohol. 1.5 × 106 4T1 cells suspended in 50 µl of basal culture medium were subcutaneously injected into the fourth left mammary fat pad of each mouse. When the tumor size reached 50–70 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into three groups including control, hibernating plasma, and non-hibernating plasma. The control group of mice was intratumorally injected with PBS (200 µl), while the other groups were respectively treated with intratumoral (i.t) injection of hibernating plasma (200 µl, 16 mg/ml) and non-hibernating plasma (200 µl, 16 mg/ml) once every day for 18 days. For tumor growth analysis, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor volume was calculated using the following equation.

$$ Tumor\; volume = \frac{{\left( {Tumor\; length} \right) \times \left( {Tumor\; width} \right)^{2} }}{2} $$

The greatest longitudinal diameter (length) and the greatest transverse diameter (width) of tumors were measured by a digital caliper (Neiko, USA) every three days. Besides, the body weights of tumor-bearing mice were measured. For survival analysis, 24 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 8). The tumor-bearing mice were closely monitored for 60 days after tumor implantation. The animals’ death was recorded every day. The failure to eat and drink for over 3 days and a lack of limb movement were considered as the standardized humane endpoint used to euthanize animals by an overdose of ketamine/xylazine solution.

Metastasis analysis

Metastasis is the main cause of death for cancer patients57,58. For metastasis analysis, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor implantation and treatment approaches were as described in the previous section. The mice were sacrificed by overdose of ketamine/xylazine and their liver and lungs were harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution 40 days after cancer cell implantation. An automatic tissue processor (Sakura, Japan) was employed to process the fixed samples. Then, a microtome (Leica Biosystems, Germany) was utilized to cut 4 µm thickness serial sections from the paraffin-embedded blocks. The sections were stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining protocol for subsequent histological evaluation59. A minimum of 10 random microscopic fields was observed under the 10 × objective lens of a light microscope (Olympus, Japan) to report the mean number of metastatic colonies per microscopic field of the liver. Furthermore, the occupied area by metastatic colonies in each microscopic field of the liver (magnification × 100) was quantified by the Qupath software. The mean percentage of occupied space by liver metastatic colonies in each microscopic field was reported for each sample. Besides, all over the H&E stained sections of lungs were analyzed for counting metastatic colonies.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical staining of the proliferation marker Ki-67 was carried out to evaluate the anti-proliferative effect of hibernating plasma on 4T1 breast tumors. This biomarker is commonly used in the clinic for identifying the prognosis and effectiveness of treatment in patients60,61. For the analysis of Ki-67, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor implantation and treatment approaches were as described in the previous section. The mice were sacrificed with the overdose of ketamine/xylazine solution after 18 days and the tumors were harvested. After 24 h fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin, the specimens were processed by an automatic tissue processor (Sakura, Japan), followed by routine methods for subsequent histological evaluation. The sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti-Ki-67 antibody (Biolegend, USA) at 4 °C overnight. The sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG followed by incubation with streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (HRP). After three times wash, the sections were incubated with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) tetrahydrochloride and followed by a counterstain with hematoxylin62. The photographs of slides were taken by using a digital light microscope (Olympus, Japan), and the percentage of tumor cells that were positive for the Ki-67 as a proliferation biomarker was quantified using ImageJ software63.

Analysis of plasma proteins by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS)

Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate–Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out to analyze the plasma proteins of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp. Firstly, 1 mg of the lyophilized plasma of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp was separately dissolved in 1 ml PBS buffer. Protein concentration of the lyophilized plasma was determined using a microplate reader (BioTek-Synergy HT, USA). Then, 15 µl of dissolved lyophilized plasma was mixed with 5 µl of sample loadings buffer for SDS-PAGE (1X; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. After that, 20 µl of this solution was loaded into each well of the gel (12% SDS-PAGE). The gels were electrophoresed at 70 V for 30 min and then at 130 V for 1.5 h using a SDS gel running buffer. The molecular weight marker of the protein (ranging from 5–232 KDa) included Insulin (5 KDa), Ribonuclease A (13 KDa), Chymotrypsinogen A (25 KDa), Ovalbumin (43 KDa), Bovin Serum Albumin (67 KDa), Aldolase (158 KDa), Catalase (232 KDa) was loaded in a lane next to the plasma samples. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 45 min at 25 °C after electrophoresis. Hot water and a shaker (IKA-Werke, Germany) were used to decolorize the gel. Finally, the gels were imaged using a Bio-5000 Plus gel imaging scanner (Zhongjing Microtek, Shanghai, China), and the density of protein bands was measured by Image J Software. The 158 KDa band cut off from the gel and send for the high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS) analysis performed by Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC-Micromass Quattro micro API Mass Spectrometer.

Statistical analysis

The data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc tests were used to evaluate the significance of the difference between groups, by employing the JMP 14.0 software (SAS Institute, Japan). The difference was considered statistically significant if P < 0.05. (*: P < 0.05, ns: not significant). The Kaplan–Meier curves were drawn and analyzed by JMP software, using the Log-Rank test to assess the significant differences between the mean survival time of tumor-bearing mice in different groups.

Ethical approval

All animal experiments and procedures were conducted according to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the University of Isfahan, which refer to the American Association for Laboratory Animals Science and the guidelines laid down by the NIH (NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals) and also ARRIVE guidelines. All experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Isfahan, Iran (IR.UI.REC.1398.072).",,"['Golpich', 'Department Of Plant', 'Animal Biology', 'Faculty Of Biological Science', 'Technology', 'University Of Isfahan', 'Isfahan', 'Amini', 'Department Of Cell', 'Molecular Biology']"
phycocyanin,phycocyanin dye,"Spirulina: Uses, Benefits, Side Effects, Dosage, Precautions","Spirulina is a blue-green algae from the genus Arthrospira (""arthro"" roughly meaning ""joint,"" and ""spira"" meaning ""spiral""). It's been used by the Aztecs in Mexico and people living in the Lake Chad area in Africa for centuries. Spirulina's usually cultivated from bodies of water like lakes or farmed in ponds.

Spirulina contains several nutrients, including fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, and K), fatty acids (DHA, EPA), beta carotene and minerals. It's also a source of protein, but it lacks high enough levels of some of the amino acids that your body needs to function at its best (unless you have a medical condition where you need to avoid specific amino acids, like phenylketonuria or ""PKU""). Since spirulina comes from bacteria (specifically ""cyanobacteria""), it may be considered a protein source for vegans.

It's also important to note that the B12 in spirulina is in a different form as ""pseudovitamin B12"" than the type typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs, especially if you follow a vegetarian or vegan way of eating, which can be low in B12. Lower levels of B12 are also found in adults over the age of 60. And why's B12 important? Because your body needs B12 to make red blood cells, it's also crucial for brain and nerve cell development. Not getting enough B12 can cause tiredness, memory loss, depression, and even different types of anemia.

This article takes a closer look at the potential uses of spirulina and the risks associated with its use.

Dietary supplements are not regulated in the United States, meaning the FDA does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement that has been tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn’t mean that they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about any potential interactions with other supplements or medications.

Uses of Spirulina

Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare provider, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD/RDN), or pharmacist. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease.



Spirulina has fat-soluble vitamins (like A, E, and K), beta carotene and minerals, protein, and phycocyanins (pigments that produce a blue color and have shown antioxidant effects). Phycocyanins have been used as a dye in many industries, including pharmacy, culinary, and even cosmetics.

Scientists have studied, but not necessarily proven, spirulina's impact on different areas of health, including but not limited to:

We'll explore what the science says about spirulina's effectiveness for these health outcomes.



Antioxidant capacity

According to a meta-analysis (a collection of research studies) of nine studies with a total of 415 people, spirulina increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The studies used anywhere from one to eight grams of spirulina per day, a pretty extensive range. Many of the studies had a relatively small number of people, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much. The strength of the effects was not earth-shattering and was generally more substantial when people took five grams of spirulina per day or more.

The conclusion? Getting antioxidants from the foods that we eat can help reduce some of the inflammation in our bodies. To amp up antioxidants in your diet, try including a variety of the most nutrient-dense foods that you can source and afford - and they don't have to be organic - like whole grains, fruit, and vegetables to help increase your body's antioxidant capacity and reduce inflammation in your body. Just don't rely on spirulina alone.

Blood pressure

Scientists did a meta-analysis (a collection of several research studies on a topic) of five randomized controlled trials that included 230 people to check spirulina's effects on blood pressure. The people in the different studies took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina a day. The lengths of the studies were anywhere from two to 12 weeks, and many of the studies were pretty small, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much.

When the data was pooled (put together) and analyzed from these studies, the scientists said that spirulina lowered systolic blood pressure by about 4.59 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure 7.02 millimeters of mercury. Systolic pressure (top number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. Diastolic pressure (bottom number) measures the pressure your arteries experience between each heartbeat. The biggest blood pressure-lowering in the studies was seen in people who had high blood pressure already.

The scientists also said more high-quality studies are needed before we can start recommending that everyone with high blood pressure needs to start eating spirulina.

Blood sugar control

Have you ever gotten a jittery feeling after eating sugary food? That usually means your blood sugar's spiking. And this situation can be dire for people coping with conditions like type I or type II diabetes, disordered eating including diabulimia, and more.

Over time, blood sugar spikes that are left uncontrolled can actually lead to damage to your body. Worst case, in certain conditions like diabetes, that can look like having to surgically remove parts of your body (amputation), heart attacks, kidney failure, or stroke, which can lead to paralysis of parts of your body. While spirulina really would not likely be able to correct severe damage from uncontrolled blood sugar over time by itself, it has lowered blood sugar levels in human studies. And why? It could be its protein and fiber content, or perhaps it is phycocyanin's ability to help with inflammation. Scientists are still figuring it out.

Fourteen studies with 510 people with metabolic syndrome–a collection of symptoms like high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (""good cholesterol""), and high waist circumference, which altogether can create more severe health problems–were included in a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on blood sugar and other outcomes. And a lot of those studies didn't have many people in them, meaning they had lower statistical power. People took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina per day. Blood sugar and insulin levels were reduced in some of the studies after taking specific amounts of spirulina. More high-quality studies are needed before healthcare providers can recommend spirulina for lowering blood sugar and insulin levels.

Generally, working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN), particularly a Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist (CDCES), can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. RDs/RDNs can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to avoid spikes in your blood sugar, which could help you feel better. Remember, managing blood sugar can be challenging, and you don't have to do it alone!

Cancer

Unfortunately, very few well-conducted human studies have looked at spirulina's effects on cancer. There've been several studies in test tube cells or in animals that aren't humans. However, more well-constructed studies looking at its effects on humans are needed.



Cholesterol levels

Scientists conducted a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on cholesterol levels that had seven controlled trials for a total of 522 total people. They found that spirulina reduced: total cholesterol (by 46.76 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)), low-density lipoprotein (LDL by 41.32 milligrams per deciliter), and triglycerides (by 44.23 milligrams per deciliter). It also increased the ""good"" cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL by 6.06 milligrams per deciliter). Again, why did spirulina do this? We're not sure, but scientists think it may be due to its nutritional profile (fiber, fatty acids like DHA and EPA), its antioxidant capacity, or a combination of these.



While healthcare providers cannot recommend spirulina for lowering your cholesterol, they can suggest working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) to help you explore your eating patterns, movement, and more. Registered dietitian nutritionists can help you build your toolkit and your capacity. Again, you're not alone!

Liver health

Spirulina has been studied for its effects on liver health in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the study was very small (only 13 people), so we can't draw any conclusions about spirulina for NAFLD until larger and better studies are done.

Metabolic syndrome

Scientists have studied spirulina's effects on metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome happens when you have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist (excess abdominal fat). Metabolic syndrome can wreak havoc with your health and increases your odds of heart attack, stroke, and type two diabetes. One of metabolic syndrome's main causes is thought to be obesity. Obesity, however, can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass.

One spirulina meta-analysis pulled together data from 18 studies. It suggested that spirulina could help lower high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, which are all parts of metabolic syndrome. It's important to note that while spirulina may impact these outcomes, the most essential issue would be working on your current way of eating, your movement (exercise), and other equally important issues like addressing your emotional health. Spirulina can't solve these serious issues.

Consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and perhaps one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. In addition, they can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to help you feel better. Sometimes it can be challenging to give yourself permission to ask for and accept help. But you've got this. And you don't have to go at it alone.

Obesity

In a meta-analysis of five studies, scientists looked at spirulina's effects on weight management in people coping with obesity. Spirulina did decrease weight in people with obesity by 4.55 pounds and in people who were overweight by 2.82 pounds. However, clinically speaking, this is not enough to make a solid recommendation for use of spirulina for obesity treatment.

As mentioned previously, it's important to note that obesity can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass. And BMI does not give the complete picture of an individual's well-being. Consider requesting a body composition test (for example, skin-fold measurements or a DEXA Body Composition scan) from your healthcare provider in addition to other parameters that they may measure.

As mentioned above, consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and, ideally, one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). CSOWM RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. They can help you build your toolkit and your capacity, and help you feel better. You've got this.



What Are the Side Effects of Spirulina?

An allergic reaction may be possible in those allergic to spirulina. Allergic reactions would include rash or swelling. Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience side effects and call your healthcare provider.



Common Side Effects

Spirulina is generally safe, but some people have reported the following with its use:

Allergy

Headache

Muscle pain

Sweating

Trouble sleeping



Severe Side Effects

While severe side effects from spirulina are rare, be aware that the following have occurred:

Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

(severe allergic reaction) Throat swelling

Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience severe side effects and call your healthcare provider.

Precautions

People with phenylketonuria (inability to process the amino acid phenylalanine) and individuals with other amino acid disorders, for example, classical homocystinuria (HCU), or maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), may need to avoid spirulina due to its high protein and thus amino acid content.



The safety of spirulina in pregnant or nursing people has not been established. Speak with your healthcare provider before using spirulina if you're pregnant, plan to get pregnant or if you're breastfeeding.

Please don't give children supplements–including spirulina–without discussing this with their pediatrician first.

Spirulina can sometimes be contaminated with things like lead or other heavy metals (it grows in lakes, after all) or even toxins.



Dosage: How Much Spirulina Should I Take?

Always speak with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement to ensure that the supplement and dosage are appropriate for your individual needs.



Manufacturer recommendations might vary. As a general guideline though, don't use more than what's listed on your product's label. There's no recommended ""effective"" dosage of spirulina. Avoid spirulina if you're allergic or sensitive to it or any of its ingredients. Studies have used from one to 10 grams a day for up to six months to 19 grams of spirulina a day for up two months, with a relatively good safety profile in people with different conditions.



Again, please do not give supplements to children without first discussing this with their pediatrician.

What Happens If I Take Too Much Spirulina?

An upper limit or recommended intake is lacking for spirulina. Taking upwards of 40 grams per day for an unknown period of time has been noted. If you believe that you've taken too much spirulina, contact your healthcare provider for information.



Interactions

Blood thinners: While there are only about 0.26 micrograms of vitamin K in each gram of spirulina, taking far larger amounts could theoretically impact the blood-thinning effects of some medicines like Jantoven (warfarin).

Immunomodulators: Little evidence exists to support avoiding the use of spirulina with immunosuppressive drugs or drugs that change the way that the immune system works (immunomodulators).

It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included. Please review this supplement label with your healthcare provider to discuss any potential interactions with foods, other supplements, and medications.



How to Store Spirulina

Store spirulina in a cool, dry place. Keep spirulina away from direct sunlight. Discard as indicated by the ""use by"" date on the packaging. Keep away from children and pets.



Similar Supplements

Chlorella (a green algae supplement) is somewhat similar to spirulina.

Frequently Asked Questions Is spirulina the same as chlorella? No, chlorella and spirulina are different species of algae, but they're both supplements.

What antioxidants does spirulina have? Spirulina has phycocyanins.

If I'm a vegan, can I get all my protein and B12 needs from spirulina? While spirulina has most of the amino acids that your body needs, it doesn't have enough of some of them. Try to eat a balanced, varied diet to meet your unique protein needs. The B12 in spirulina–pseudovitamin B12–is in a different form than the type that's typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs.

Sources of Spirulina & What to Look For

Blue-green algae species used in spirulina supplements are typically Spirulina maxima, Spirulina platensis, or Aphanizomenon flos-aquae.



Just because a remedy is thought to be ""natural"" does not mean that it is safe. Some ""wild-crafted"" spirulina products may have been grown in water contaminated with heavy metals (mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium) or other pollutants. Opt for supplements produced in labs and certified by third-party authorities like the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF International.



As with all supplements, it's essential to talk with your healthcare provider before using spirulina to decide if it's right for you.

Phycocyanin pigments are vital for multiple industries, having various important commercial applications. Producing them from gas and oil wastewater presents a sustainable waste valorization process that fits the aims of the circular economy concept.

Phycocyanin

Phycocyanin, along with allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin, is a pigment-protein complex. It is a water-soluble light-harvesting phycobiliprotein with a characteristic light blue color and is an accessory pigment to chlorophyll. Phycocyanins are produced by cyanobacteria.

There are numerous commercial and scientific uses of phycocyanin. It is used as a natural food coloring, in nutritional supplements (for example, spirulina,) as a coloring in cosmetics, and as fluorescent markers in immunological assays. It is also used in animal feeds and aquaculture. Additionally, it contains anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and antiviral properties, making it an attractive target for therapeutics and drugs within the biomedical industry.

Using Petrochemical Wastewater for Microalgae Culture

The petrochemical industries produce large volumes of wastewater globally as a result of oil and gas extraction. Over 90% is re-injected into formations or disposal wells for recovery. Treatment ponds are used to store most of the remaining wastewater. If disposed of untreated into the environment, wastewater can cause significant levels of pollution, affecting vulnerable ecosystems.

Using produced wastewater for the cultivation of algae is a huge opportunity for the valorization of waste streams in the oil and gas industries. This can be used for nutrient recovery, with the biomass used for beneficial purposes. A 2017 study has found that whilst produced wastewater has high salinity and organic compounds that are detrimental for algae growth, important inorganic nutrients which microbes use for growth are present, which is advantageous. Produced wastewater can therefore be used as a culture medium.

Additionally, there are indications that using produced wastewater for microalgal cultivation can be used for biofuel production as well as microbial wastewater treatment. Another recent study has demonstrated the possibility of utilizing microalgal cultivation for nutrient removal.

The majority of current investigations into using produced wastewater as a microalgae cultivation medium have focused on using microalgal biofilms for biofuel production. Conversely, there is limited research into the production of valuable bioproducts. Integrating side streams of valuable bioproducts into processes using microalgal biorefineries could help reduce the costs associated with microalgal wastewater treatment and biofuel production.

The recovery of phycobiliproteins such as phycocyanin and their derivative products can be easily integrated into microalgae biorefinery operations, and the water solubility of phycobiliproteins means that they do not interfere with the recovery of denser liquids. Thus, integrating them into these operations can optimize operations and add value to them.

Suitable substrates for microalgae biofilm growth have been identified in the current literature, with over 15 different materials so far explored. Cotton-based materials have been identified as the best-performing options.

The Study

The main purpose of the new study published online in Frontiers in Energy Research is to evaluate the influence of growth materials and light intensity in a rotating algae biofilm reactor on phycocyanin production. LLC2, a strain of cyanobacteria, was chosen for its ability to form biofilms in different light and substrate conditions. High levels of turbidity and good solid biomass production were identified as key factors in the choice of the reactor for the study.

The team constructed a 2000-liter outdoor-produced water pond at Utah State University. The pool was operated between August and September due to favorable outdoor temperature and the pond was shaded to control light intensity. Out of the materials tested for biofilm growth substratum, the cotton rope was identified as the best option.

Amongst the experimental observations in the study, low light LLC2 biofilms produced twice the amount of phycocyanin per biomass yield compared to high light biofilms. An accompanying crude extract purity (just above the benchmark standard for food-grade phycocyanin) was observed. The authors concluded that different production goals could be achieved by adjusting the light level for biofilm culture.

Based on their experimental observations, the authors have stated that future studies should concentrate on producing other high-value products from microalgae cultures in produced wastewater. Additionally, amongst other future research directions suggested in the study, the potential value of cyanobacteria biofilms to produce valuable bioproducts such as fertilizer, feed, biofuels, and biogas should be assessed in studies.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,Scientists unlocking secret of phycocyanin instability for vivid blues,"Phycocyanin is a food colourant that provides a vivid blue pigment. However, it has a drawback: it can prove unstable when used in formulations like soft drinks and sports beverages, losing its hues under fluorescent light on the grocery store shelf.

Scientists at Cornell University say they have found the reason for this unique behaviour ‘with the help of physics’ and the ‘bright X-ray beams’ from the University’s synchrotron.

“Phycocyanin has a vibrant blue colour,”​ said Alireza Abbaspourrad, assistant professor of food chemistry and ingredient technology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “However, if you want to put phycocyanin into acidified beverages, the blue colour fades quickly due to thermal treatment.”​

Now, they believe they have the opportunity to stabilise it, according to new research published in the American Chemical Society’s journal BioMacromolecules​.

The research, ‘Tuning C-Phycocyanin Photoactivity via pH-Mediated Assembly–Disassembly​’, was authored by Ying Li, a doctoral student in food science; Richard Gillilan, staff scientist at the Macromolecular X-ray science at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source; and Abbaspourrad.

Protein structure and colour stability

Most food companies seeking blues in their food use synthetic food dye, Abbaspourrad said.

Phycocyanin is derived from algae and as such it represents a natural and more nutritional protein that could help food and beverage manufacturers meet growing demand for clean label, natural products. The food scientists therefore set out to understand its colour properties and how it worked.

To achieve this, the researchers partnered with the Macromolecular Diffraction Facility of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) and used Size-Exclusion Chromatography coupled to Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SEC−SAXS) on a beamline.

Phycocyanin was placed into a biological fluid and brought to the MacCHESS laboratory. There, intense beamline X-rays were channelled into tiny drops of the fluid. The small-angle X-ray scattering showed that as pH levels, the molecular strands changed into different shapes, folds and assemblies.

“As pH changes, the phycocyanin molecules form in different ways. If the pH goes up, the molecules come together and if the pH level goes down, the molecules disassemble,”​ explained Li.

“As we changed the environmental stimulus for the phycocyanin, the molecules modulate their behaviour in terms of how they interact with light. It's a relationship of the protein structure and the colour stability.”​

The acidity of the environment can essentially mediate an assembly-disassembly pathway, Abbaspourrad said. “Through the X-ray scattering we could see the proteins and see how their monomers are assembled together and how the oligomers disassemble. That’s the root cause for how the blue colour fades,”​ he explained.

Analyses of tumor weight, tumor inhibitory rate, and organ index

The tumor volume growth curves are shown in Fig. 2. The tumor growth rate in the model group was more than 2.6 cm3 on Day 15. In contrast, CTX-treated and all EPA-treated groups showed obvious inhibition of tumor growth.

The organ index, tumor weight, and tumor inhibitory rate (TIR) are shown in Table 2. The CTX-treated group exhibited the highest TIR (92.42%). Moreover, the tumor weight in the EPA-treated groups significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, with tumor inhibitory rates of 79.70%, 84.55%, and 87.28%. The spleen and thymus indices were significantly lower in the CTX-treated group than in the normal group, and the thymus was severely atrophic (p < 0.05). The EPA-treated groups showed significant improvements, and there was a protective effect on the spleen and thymus.

Analysis of the expression of serum cytokines and VEGF in mice

ELISA was used to investigate the effects of EPA on serum cytokine production, including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, AST, BUN, and IL-6, in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Angiogenesis has become an important therapeutic target for many tumors and is an essential process for tumor growth and metastasis10,16.

As shown in Fig. 3, compared with the levels in the normal and model groups, the serum levels of IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α significantly increased in the EPA-treated HD group (p < 0.05). VEGF levels were significantly decreased in the CTX-treated and EPA-treated groups. The AST and BUN levels in the model group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group (p < 0.05). The values of these two parameters significantly decreased in the EPA-treated groups compared to those in the model control group (p < 0.05). The AST levels of mice in the CTX-treated group were significantly higher than those of the model group (p < 0.05).

Morphological analysis after treatment with EPA

Histopathology was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the tumor. As shown in Fig. 4A, tumor cell in the model group s were plump and intact, with large nuclei. After treatment with EPA and CTX, the tumor cells exhibited a large necrotic region and were stained darker, which indicates that the significant antitumor efficacy of EPA in H22 tumor-bearing mice involved inducing cell death.

Figure 4 Histological examination of the morphological changes in tumors from H22-bearing mice. Tumor tissues stained with H&E (A) (400 ×) TUNEL assay (400 ×) (B,C). Full size image

The TUNEL assay results are shown in Fig. 4B,C, and cells with brown granules were considered positively stained10,17. The percentage of positive cells in the model group was 5%; therefore, the amount of tumor cell apoptosis was minimal. However, the CTX-treated group exhibited the highest percentage of positive cells (44%). The EPA-treated groups showed an increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, with values of 12%, 28%, and 42%. Moreover, the mice in the HD and EPA-treated group showed a positive cell percentage similar to that of the CTX-treated group.

Effects of EPA on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and VEGF

Based on the results of previous studies18, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the proapoptotic factor BAX, the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase 3 to determine the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, as shown in Fig. 5. BAX and cleaved caspase 3 expression intensities increased, while Bcl-2 expression decreased in the EPA-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the ratio of Bcl-2 to BAX decreased significantly. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level in the EPA-treated groups significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and VEGF expression was lowest in the CTX-treated group.

In addition, western blotting was used to analyze the expression of Bcl-2, BAX, cleaved caspase 3, and VEGF. As shown in Fig. 6, all EPA-treated groups showed increased BAX and cleaved caspase 3 protein expression and decreased Bcl-2 and VEGF protein expression; these results were consistent with the results of the immunohistochemical analysis. However, the expression of PI3K/AKT and p-AKT/AKT increased in a dose-dependent manner in the EPA-treated group.

Results of the rank-abundance curves of microorganisms in samples

The rank-abundance curve is a method used to analyze the diversity of microorganisms. In this study, the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) rank-abundance curves showed the diversity in the samples, which can be explained by species richness and evenness19. In the horizontal direction, the wider the span of the curve is, the richer the species rank of the microorganism sample20. The OTU rank-abundance curve in this study showed that the abundance distribution of the samples was even, as it was flat and smooth in the vertical direction (Fig. 7). The richness and evenness of the samples shown in the rank-abundance curve indicate that the diversity of the samples was rational and reasonable.

Dilution curves of microorganisms in the gut microbiota

The dilution curve was used to evaluate whether the sample sequencing depth was sufficient to cover all species of microbes and compare species richness among different sequenced samples. A flat curve indicates that the sequencing data are reasonable and reflect the structure of the entire community21. The number of sequences reached 5000, and the curves were in the plateau stage (Fig. 8). Therefore, the experimental data were deemed reasonable and reliable.

Species accumulation curves of the gut microbiota

The species accumulation curve is used to describe the increase in species with the increase in the number of samples and is an effective tool for investigating the composition and predicting the abundance of species in samples. This curve reflects whether the number of samples was sufficient. In this study, we mainly observed the end of the curve; if it showed a sharp upward trend, the number of samples was considered insufficient, while if the end of the curve tended to be flat, the number of samples was considered sufficient22. The end of the species accumulation curves of Specaccums tended to be flat in this study; therefore, the sampling was considered sufficient to carry out data analysis (Fig. 9).

Results of alpha diversity analysis of the gut microbiota

In this study, six indicators, including the Chao1 index, observed species index, PD_whole_tree index, goods-coverage index, Shannon index, and Simpson's index, were analyzed to assess the species diversity of individual samples (Fig. 10). There was no significant difference in flora abundance or diversity between the normal, model, and HD groups in the EPA-treated group.

Results of beta diversity analysis of the gut microbiota

Beta diversity analysis was used to compare the differences in species diversity among intergroup samples, and the evolutionary distance between species was considered while calculating the results. The higher the index value, the greater the difference between the samples. In this study, the UniFrac results were divided into two parts: the weighted UniFrac, which considered the abundance of the sequence, and the unweighted UniFrac, which did not consider the abundance of the sequence. According to the statistical analysis of the differences of the clustered samples, the similarity of species composition among the samples was determined by calculating the distance between the samples23.

ANOSIM similarity analysis was used to determine the intergroup and intragroup differences, and the grouping was found to be meaningful (Fig. 11). The R value of the unweighted results was R = 0.34 > 0 and p = 0.001 < 0.05, indicating that the differences between the groups were significantly greater than those within the group (intragroup). Therefore, the result is reasonable, and the data are statistically significant. Thus, in this study, the gut microbiota in tumor-bearing mice tended to be normal after EPA treatment.

Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was used to evaluate the differences between samples (Fig. 12)24. If the samples were in close proximity, the species compositions of the samples were similar. The EPA-treated group was closer in distance to the normal group, indicating that both groups had similar gut microbiotas.

Difference Analysis of the Gut Microbiota

To emphasize the statistical significance and biological relevance, the LEFse analysis of the gut microflora was performed, and the results are presented quantitatively in an LDA Score column and a cladogram. This study aimed to estimate the impact of the abundance of each component and identify the significant difference effect on the division of samples23. The results showed significant differences in the gut microflora, such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Streptococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Alistipes (Nor), Campylobacterales, Epsilonproteobacteria, Helicobacteraceae, Helicobacter, Escherichia_Shigella, Subdoligranulum (Mod), Prevotellaceae, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidaceae, Bacteroides, and Selenomonadales (EPA) (Figs. 13 and 14).

Species abundance in the gut microbiota

Histograms showing species profiling in the gut microflora of each sample were used to identify the species with higher relative abundances and individual samples at different classification levels (Fig. 15A and Table 3)25. In this study, the phylum level showed that Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Proteobacteria accounted for more than 98% of the total microflora after the different treatments. Compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes decreased, but Proteobacteria increased in the model group. In contrast, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes increased, but Proteobacteria decreased in the EPA-treated group and was close to that in the normal group. Thus, the trend in the two phyla in the microflora in the EPA-treated group trended more toward that in the normal group.

Table 3 The relative abundance of the main gut microbiota at the phylum level in four groups. Full size table

Figure 15B shows the genus level of the gut microflora in the three groups. Based on abundance, the main groups were Lactobacillus, Bacteroidales_S24 − 7_group_norank, Bacteroidales, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 001, Alloprevotella, Streptococcus, Alistipes, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 003, and Helicobacter. Based on the changing trend in the abundance of the gut microflora, it can be concluded that tumor-bearing mice that were treated with EPA tended to be closer to those in the normal control group. Compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of beneficial microflora such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroidales_S24 − 7_group_norank, Bacteroidales, Alloprevotella and Alistipes in the model group decreased by 6.95%, 25.25%, 4.67%, 2.65%, and 0.68%, respectively; accordingly, compared with those in the model group, those in the EPA group increased by 10.67%, 19.94%, 1.34%, and 3.29%, respectively, which showed a significant reversion in the reduction in beneficial microflora in the model group. In contrast, compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of the harmful microflora Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 001, Helicobacter, and Prevotellaceae_UCG − 003 in the model group increased to 16.39%, 7.01%, 5.83%, and 8.81%, respectively, while those in the EPA-treated group decreased to 17.99%, 1.44%, 5.81%, and 3.33%, respectively. These results showed that EPA treatment balanced the relative abundance of beneficial and detrimental bacteria in the gut microflora, as observed in the normal group.",,"['Wang', 'Academy Of Traditional Chinese Medicine', 'Jilin Agricultural Science', 'Technology University', 'Jilin', 'Academy Of Medical', 'Changchun Sci-Tech University', 'Changchun', 'Zhang', 'Liu']"
phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,A waste-to-wealth initiative exploiting the potential of Anabaena variabilis for designing an integrated biorefinery,"Characterization of aqua discharge, poultry litter, and cow dung

The study began with the characterization of wastewater, and solid wastes, where all the wastes analyzed viz., aqua discharge (AD), poultry litter (PL), and cow dung (CD) were found to be enriched with total organic carbon (TOC). AD also displayed a considerable presence of nitrate with a comparatively lower amount of nitrite, orthophosphate, and ammonium. In contrast, for the solid wastes (PL and CD), ammonium and orthophosphate were much more prevalent than nitrate and nitrite. Additionally, the lower dissolved oxygen (DO) and considerable chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biological oxygen demand (BOD) values of AD indicated the presence of organic load in the samples (Tables 1 and 2).

Biomass and total carbohydrate estimation of A. variabilis cultivated in AD medium compared to control BG-11 medium

Time-course studies were conducted to compare the biomass and total carbohydrate production of A. variabilis in control (BG-11 medium) and AD medium (Fig. 2). In this regard, the maximum biomass yield obtained using AD medium (0.45 g L−1) was fairly lower than that of the control (0.58 g L−1) (Fig. 2a). However, the total carbohydrate content displayed a ~ 20% higher value in the AD medium (58.0% dcw) compared to control (46.5% dcw) (Fig. 2b). This increased content obtained using the AD medium compensated for the reduced biomass yield, thus, not compromising with the volumetric production (mg L−1) of total carbohydrate. As a result, the total carbohydrate yield was comparable in both the cultivation media with respective values of 269.7 mg L−1 and 261.0 mg L−1 in control and AD medium (Fig. 2c). In contrast to control, where the maximum value for biomass and total carbohydrate was recorded on the 24th day, the incubation period was reduced to 21st day for cultures grown in the AD medium.

Biomass and total carbohydrate estimation of A. variabilis cultivated in different concentrations of PL and CD

Comparative analysis for biomass yield of A. variabilis cultivated in different concentrations of PL and CD are depicted in Fig. 3a–d, respectively. In order to have a better representation, two concentrations were considered at a time, each for PL and CD, and compared to the BG-11 control. An increasing trend was observed in the biomass production by augmenting the PL level up to 10 g L−1, whereas with CD extract, the maximum value was obtained at 15 g L−1 concentration, above which a declining pattern was observed. However, PL was found to stimulate the growth of A. variabilis more effectively than CD. The biomass yield attained its paramount value (0.90 g L−1) in the PL concentration of 10 g L−1 compared to 0.58 g L−1 in control (BG-11 medium), representing a 35.5% rise (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the biomass yield reached a maximum of 0.84 g L−1 using the CD concentration of 15 g L−1, demonstrating a 30.9% higher value than the control (Fig. 3d). For all the studied concentrations, A. variabilis displayed the peak value on day 24 of its incubation.

Figure 3 Time-course analysis of biomass yield (g L−1) of A. variabilis cultivated in different concentrations of PL: (a) 5 g L−1, 10 g L−1 (b) 15 g L−1, 20 g L−1 and CD: (c) 5 g L−1, 10 g L−1 (d) 15 g L−1, 20 g L−1 compared to control BG-11 medium. Full size image

Similarly, PL concentration of 10 g L−1 also resulted in the highest total carbohydrate content of 57.4% dcw with respect to 46.4% dcw obtained in the control BG-11 medium. Consequently, its yield was boosted to 516.6 mg L−1, representing a 47.9% higher value than the control (269.1 mg L−1) (Table 3). In contrast, for CD, the maximum total carbohydrate content of 52.3% dcw was recorded using 15 g L−1 concentration. At this concentration, the total carbohydrate yield reached 439.3 mg L−1, showing a 38.7% rise compared to control (Table 3).

Studies with combination of wastewater with solid wastes

Biomass and total carbohydrate estimation of A. variabilis cultivated in wastewater supplemented with different concentrations of PL and CD

The individual studies with solid wastes conducted so far involved cultivating the test cyanobacterium in PL and CD extract prepared with millipore water. To further economize the process, subsequent analyses were made in a medium prepared by supplementing these solid wastes in wastewater (AD). AD supplemented with 7.5 g L−1 PL was found to be the most suitable combination resulting in the highest biomass yield of 0.85 g L−1. Augmenting the level of PL in the AD medium to 10 g L−1 marked its de-escalation to 0.77 g L−1 (Table 4). For CD supplemented conditions, the combination of AD with 10 g L−1 CD was best amongst all, resulting in biomass produce of 0.78 g L−1 (Table 4). However, PL supplementation once again had a more dominating effect on A. variabilis, generating higher biomass yield at a comparatively lower concentration (7.5 g L−1). The biomass yield using the said combination (AD + 7.5 g L−1 PL) represented a 31.8% rise compared to the BG-11 control, which was also 47.1% higher than the un-supplemented AD medium.

Table 4 Maximum biomass and total carbohydrate production of A. variabilis in AD supplemented with different concentrations of PL and CD, compared to control (BG-11) and un-supplemented AD. Full size table

The carbohydrate production of the test cyanobacterium was also found to be maximum in AD supplemented with 7.5 g L−1 PL. The total carbohydrate content of 58.4% dcw and yield of 496.4 mg L−1 obtained using this combination was again highest in comparison to all the other PL supplemented conditions (Table 4). These values were also higher than the CD supplemented AD medium, where the maximum total carbohydrate content (53.4% dcw) and yield (416.5 mg L−1) were obtained at a concentration of 10 g L−1 (Table 4). Hence, using AD in combination with 7.5 g L−1 PL, a respective rise of 20.5% and 45.8% in total carbohydrate content and yield was recorded with respect to the control BG-11 medium. Although, compared to the un-supplemented AD medium, the cellular carbohydrate content did not show much variation, the rise in its volumetric yield was by 47.6%. Therefore, for the economical production of large volume bioethanol, the combination of AD with 7.5 g L−1 PL was chosen for further study. This medium was termed as ‘APL.’

Characterization of APL medium

The obtained APL medium was also characterized for the presence of orthophosphate, ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite, TOC, DO, COD, BOD and pH which are depicted in Table 5.

Table 5 Characteristics of APL medium. Full size table

Bioremediation efficiency of A. variabilis grown in APL medium

Inoculation of the APL medium with A. variabilis revealed 100% removal of orthophosphate within 30 days; and nitrate and nitrite within 20 and 15 days of incubation, respectively. While the concentration of ammonium was reduced to 19.2 mg L−1 from an initial value of 74.2 mg L−1, TOC content showed a drop from 91.3 mg L−1 to 17.8 mg L−1 in 35 days of incubation. In other words, cultivation of the test cyanobacterium in the APL medium brought about a respective 74.1% and 80.5% depletion in its ammonium and TOC concentration. COD and BOD were also reduced to 16.6 mg L−1 and 7.3 mg L−1 at the end of 35 days compared to 161.3 mg L−1 and 73.2 mg L−1, respectively, on day zero. Concurrently, an increase in the DO up to 6.8 mg L−1 was observed after the completion of 35 days of incubation (from 4.1 mg L−1 noted initially). The maximum pH of 7.3 was recorded on the 25th day of incubation (Table 6).

Table 6 Concentration changes in APL medium after inoculation with A. variabilis. Full size table

Individual production of bioethanol and co-products from A. variabilis grown in APL medium

As already observed in Table 4, AD + 7.5 g L−1 PL induced the maximum carbohydrate accumulation in A. variabilis. The carbohydrate obtained from the test cyanobacterium grown in APL medium was also predominated by higher yields of fermentable components such as reducing sugar and glycogen (Supplementary Figure S1). Consequently, an elevated volumetric production of bioethanol was obtained using the APL medium. Compared to 118.4 mg L−1 in BG-11 control, the bioethanol yield obtained from APL-grown A. variabilis showed a rise to 219.9 mg L−1, signifying a 46.2% higher value. Nevertheless, for both the conditions (control and APL), the bioethanol conversion % was found to range between 44 and 44.3% (Table 7).

Table 7 Bioethanol production in control (BG-11) and APL medium along with the conversion efficiencies. Full size table

APL medium also served effectively for significant accumulation of all the co-products (Table 8). Using this medium, C-PC content was increased to 5.4% dcw from 3.0% dcw in BG-11 control. On the other hand, PHB and SCC contents were respectively enhanced to 8.3% and 0.07% dcw in the APL medium compared to 6.1% and 0.04% dcw in control. A marginal increase was also witnessed in the EPS content from 39.2% (control) to 43.6% dcw (APL medium). This upsurge in the cellular concentration of the co-products alongside the augmented biomass yield of A. variabilis in the APL medium also heightened their volumetric production. A ~ 61–62% increase was noted for SCC and C-PC yield, recording respective values of 0.59 mg L−1 and 45.9 mg L−1 in the APL medium compared to 0.23 mg L−1 and 17.4 mg L−1 in BG-11 control. Likewise, the yield of PHB and EPS were also elevated to 70.6 mg L−1 and 370.6 mg L−1 from 35.4 mg L−1 and 227.4 mg L−1 in control, indicating a respective ~ 50% and ~ 39% rise (Table 8).

Table 8 Co-products obtained individually from A. variabilis grown in the BG-11 control and APL medium, expressed as content (% dcw) and yield (mg L−1). Full size table

Bioethanol and the co-products harnessed from A. variabilis and their validation using different confirmatory analyses have been summarized in Fig. 4, the comprehensive illustration of which has been provided in Supplementary Figures S2–S7.

Figure 4 Production and confirmatory analyses of (a) Bioethanol, (b) C-PC, (c) PHB, (d) SCC, and (e) EPS from A. variabilis. Full size image

Bioethanol was obtained after fermentation of the pretreated hydrolysate and harvested by phase separation (Fig. 4a) using Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP). The bioethanol production was confirmed using GC–MS analysis, where its presence was detected at the retention time of 1.68 min (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figure S2), referring to the NIST mass spectral library.

C-phycocyanin (C-PC) was extracted as water-soluble blue color pigment and stored as freeze-dried powder (Fig. 4b). The confirmatory detection of C-PC was based on the spectrophotometric determination of the distinct peak at 620 nm, the absorption maxima of C-PC (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Figure S3).

Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) was extracted as white polymer, and its accumulation in A. variabilis was detected using GC analysis (Fig. 4c). The polymer sample obtained from the test cyanobacterium conformed to the standard PHB exhibiting the specific peak at the retention time of 4.5 min, hence, confirming PHB synthesis by A. variabilis (Supplementary Figure S4).

Chlorophyll extracted from A. variabilis was converted into its water-soluble derivative- sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC), which appeared as blue-black powder (Fig. 4d). The identification of SCC was performed using two confirmatory tests (copper test and flame test) to validate the presence of copper in it. In copper test, the formation of a brown-colored complex of copper diethyldithiocarbamate after addition of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate confirmed the presence of copper in the produced SCC sample. In flame test, the SSC sample solution burnt with a green-colored flame, hence, reconfirming the presence of copper in it (Fig. 4d). Additionally, the absorption spectrum of the produced SCC sample was also found to be similar to the standard SCC, showing peaks at the wavelengths of 405 nm and 635 nm (Supplementary Figure S5). This analogy in absorbance behavior again validated the SCC formation in the present study.

Exopolysaccharides (EPS) extracted from the test cyanobacterium when freeze-dried appeared as white cottony fiber (Fig. 4e). HPLC analysis revealed the obtained EPS to be constituted of pentoses like ribose and xylose; and hexoses, such as mannose, glucose, and galactose (Supplementary Figure S6), demonstrating the characteristic feature of cyanobacterial EPS29. The identification of these constituent sugars was performed by comparing their elution time with that of the standards (Supplementary Figure S7a–e).

Cyanobacterial refinery

After having established the suitability of APL medium in stimulating the individual yields of bioethanol and the co-products, it was applied to sequentially extract all the cyanobacterial products from the same harvested biomass. However, the major hindrance faced while executing a step-wise production is the intervention of solvents and extraction processes employed for a particular product on the yield of the others that are to be extracted subsequently. Therefore, in this study, six different sequences were analyzed to screen out the best amongst them that would ensure minimum yield losses (Table 9).

Table 9 Variation in the yield of different products from A. variabilis (equivalent to 1 kg dry biomass) grown in APL medium when placed in different sequential extraction positions. Full size table

Here, the amount of the harnessed products was calculated considering 1 kg dry (≈10 kg wet) biomass of A. variabilis grown in the APL medium. Hence, it becomes mandatory first to mention the yields of each product obtained individually from 1 kg of dry biomass without implementing the sequential extraction strategy. The individual EPS yield was 436.0 g, constituted by 224.5 g RPS and 211.5 g CPS, while the yields for SCC, C-PC, PHB, and carbohydrate were 0.69 g, 54.0 g, 83.1 g, and 584.0 g, respectively. Comparison of all the studied sequences (Table 9) revealed sequence 3 to result in minimum yield loss of all the co-products, comparable to their individual yields. Using this sequence, EPS yield of 430.1 g (222.7 g RPS + 207.4 g CPS), SCC yield of 0.66 g, C-PC yield of 52.9 g, and PHB yield of 79.4 g was obtained. However, compared to individual yield, carbohydrate was compromised in all the sequences, with sequence 3 generating a yield of 369.7 g. This was possibly owing to the prior extraction of CPS (capsular polysaccharides), which accounts for a significant portion of the cell’s total carbohydrate. As a consequence, the anticipated bioethanol yield was likely to be hampered, which is the primary product of the study. Therefore, the carbohydrate and bioethanol production from A. variabilis was also checked under the selected sequence 3 by eliminating the CPS extraction step. Removing this step resulted in notably higher bioethanol production (324.9 mL) comparable to the individual yield obtained from 1 kg dry biomass (329.5 mL). With respect to the sequence integrating CPS extraction, the bioethanol yield using the modified protocol (without CPS) also indicated a 35% rise (Supplementary Table S1). As a whole, using this designed refinery approach, ~ 61% of the cyanobacterial biomass could be effectively utilized for the production of bioethanol and various industrially vital products. The detailed design for the cyanobacterial refinery using the selected sequence has been schematically illustrated in Fig. 5.

Techno-economic assessment

One of the critical factors that confine the practical implication of a biorefinery is its economic feasibility under large-scale. Hence an idea regarding the techno-economic aspect is vital to apprehend the success of the developed strategy when upgraded to a large-scale scenario. Considering the direct costs involved in a biomass-based biorefinery, huge expenses are incurred in the growth medium of the test species that serve as the raw material for biomass production31. Nonetheless, in our current approach, the cyanobacterial species exploits waste-utilized APL medium for its growth, thereby completely nullifying the cost of the cultivation medium. The efficient nutrient removal ability of A. variabilis further alleviates the expenditure on additional waste remediation infrastructures32. Moreover, since the wastes (for formulating APL medium) were collected from the close vicinity of the experimental site, the transportation charges can also be considered negligible.

However, the harvesting process of the cyanobacterial biomass is a major cost-incurring step that can hinder large-scale biomass production. Hence, proper choice of harvesting methodology is crucial while aiming for biomass harvest under a scaled-up system. Among the different techniques, pH-induced flocculation using NaOH has been reported as the most economical and eco-friendly harvesting method for large-scale set-ups33,34. Assuming a scaled-up cultivation system of 10,000 L employing the APL medium, the harvest cost is estimated to be 0.765 $. This assessment relies on the published investigation of Koley et al.33, demonstrating the requirement of ~ 62 g NaOH/kg of harvested biomass alongside power consumption of 0.2 kW h/kg for culture agitation under field-level analysis.

Implementing the cyanobacterial refinery would also take into account the investments on the solvents and chemicals for extraction of the products. Following the sequential biorefinery protocol designed in this study, the cost of these extractants per Kg biomass reaches 7420.8 US$ (Table 10). It is worth mentioning here that the expenditure on pre-treatment, fermentation, and separation of bioethanol involving the use of sulfuric acid, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), YPD (yeast extract peptone dextrose) medium, and tributyl phosphate (TBP)26 would also contribute to the overall cost (Table 10).

Table 10 Cost estimation of chemicals and solvents required for harnessing the cyanobacterial products using the sequential biorefinery design, utilizing APL medium. Full size table

Hence, from the above table, the estimated cost of extractants required for the scaled-up biorefinery (10,000 L culture volume) can be evaluated as 63,102 US$. Additionally, the refinery protocol also involves oven drying of the cyanobacterial biomass (Fig. 5). With electricity requirement of ~ 6.32 kWh for obtaining 1 kg dry biomass26,35, the cost for drying the biomass harvested from 10,000 L culture approximates to 7.52 US$.

Despite these outlays, the large-scale execution of the proposed biorefinery looks plausible in view of the high commercial value of the harnessed cyanobacterial products. The projected earnings from commercializing all the cyanobacterial products (EPS, SCC, C-PC, PHB, and bioethanol) obtained under a scaled-up scenario of the present approach corresponds to ~ 7.2 million US$. This estimation has been carried out considering the market price of each product23,26. However, the total production cost would also include the cost of the cultivation set-up. Closed systems like a tubular photobioreactor (PBR) have been reported to account for up to 83% of the capital cost36. Besides, such mass-cultivation operations have to meet with general overhead charges related to cleaning, maintenance, and administration of the plant31. Though open-pond systems are known to procure lesser investments, PBRs ensure higher productivity accompanied by low downstream processing charges23,37. Hence, keeping aside some days for cleaning and maintenance of the system, running multiple cycles of cultivation per year would definitely increase the profit margin. This would, in turn, recompense the cost of initial investments on large-scale projects, helping to overcome the real-time challenges faced while establishing a successful biorefinery.

Environmental sustainability assessment

Environmental sustainability is another significant area to be addressed while assessing the aptness of a developed strategy. One way to conduct this assessment is through the evaluation of impact indicators such as cumulative primary energy (CPE) and global warming potential (GWP)38. Using the LCA (Life Cycle Analysis) methodology with these impact indicators, all the inputs and outputs of a system are taken into account. The output constitutes both quantitative and qualitative products generated, alongside the waste discharges in the environment, including emissions. On the other hand, the inputs encompass all the primary raw materials involved in each step of the production process. Fossil fuel for electricity generation, feedstocks for fertilizers production, energy requirement for extraction, processing, and transportation of the primary growth nutrients of the dedicated crop, etc., all fall under this category39. Therefore, determining the energy efficiency of a system is imperative for evaluating its ecological impact. In this direction, EROI (Energy Return on Investment) is a potential measure to check the energy balance of a particular process/product/system, which can be calculated using the following equation40:

$$EROI = \frac{Product\;energy\,output}{{Primary\;energy\;input\,(CED)}}$$

where ‘Product energy output’ indicates the energetic biomass fraction from which the final energy output (microalgal/cyanobacterial product) has been generated, and ‘CED’ stands for cumulative energy demand.

The above elucidation has been made in the context of third-generation feedstocks (microalgae/cyanobacteria), where a significant contribution to CED arises from the demand for nitrogen and phosphorus, the principal nutrients for their growth41. The value of the EROI should be > 1 to reflect a net positive energy balance41. This can be achieved by adopting strategies to lower the CED, which would, in turn, increase the EROI. Hence utilization of the nutrient-laden APL medium formulated out of wastes is expected to boost the overall EROI value by abating the nutrient supply in the cultivation phase. The carbon richness of the APL medium (Table 5) would also lessen the energy burden by rendering additional CO 2 sparging inessential. Use of the flocculation method for biomass harvest can further reduce the energy consumption involved in the centrifugation step, upsurging the net EROI42.

There always exists a relationship between the energy inputs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Global warming potential (GWP) (expressed as CO 2 equivalents) serves as an important tool for environmental sustainability measurement of a particular process/product. Unfortunately, most present-day biofuel production using conventional crops contributes minimally to GHG mitigation. Cultivation of the terrestrial crops demands clearance of grasslands and forests, which results in the loss of ongoing carbon dioxide capture43. The soil organic matter is also broken down, accelerating the release of carbon from the soil44. Besides, N 2 O emissions from the field applications of fertilizers and pesticides are the foremost contributor to GHG, with GWP > CO 2 by 298 times45. Contrarily, cyanobacteria/algae-derived biofuels have been specified to reduce GHG releases, particularly lowering the emissions from changes in the land-use practices43. The use of fertilizers and pesticides is also prevented46, reducing the N 2 O release. However, the emissions from fossil-fuel-driven energy production cannot be disregarded, as electricity requirement remains indispensable for various operational stages of the production process. The GWP per kWh will depend upon the electricity mix of a particular region47. Nonetheless, from the LCA perspective, an integrated production system with quantitative coproduct generation is known to lessen the extent of ecological impact48. This again points toward the large-scale applicability of the APL mediated biorefinery design, as it induced a remarkable rise in the yield of all the cyanobacterial products. Moreover, using cyanobacterial cultivation as a means of nutrient removal avoids the energy investment on separate wastewater treatment procedures, also withdrawing the release of the related emissions.

Cyanobacterial cultivation can suffer a major setback, specifically in areas where freshwater is limited. Hence, utilization of wastewater medium can also be a boon in lessening the freshwater inputs for the cultivation process. Taking ‘Water Footprints (WF)’ as an indicator of water-use extent, application of wastewater instead of freshwater would reduce the blue WF. Furthermore, the biologically treated wastewater can be recycled and reused. This would also help lower the grey WF by abating the chances of freshwater pollution23. A comprehensive take on the sustainability analysis of a multiproduct cyanobacterial biorefinery study would still mandate the complete LCA of each product. This would involve the evaluation of all the input and output parameters for every step right from cultivation, harvest, downstream processing, product generation, use, and disposal. A detailed analysis in this direction will be an essential domain to follow up in the offing.

Nonetheless, herein we try to portray the scope of the present biorefinery design by an ‘onion model’ consisting of distinct layers (Fig. 6). This holistic interpretation gives a clear idea regarding the different levels involved in the process implementation, indicating the specific purpose of each level. It is to be noted that the onion model depicted here has been constructed in view of the futuristic prospects of the present biorefinery design when scaled up to a photobioreactor (PBR) system. The positive scopes of cultivating A. variabilis in a PBR set-up have been discussed in our previous paper23.",,"['Deb', 'Agricultural', 'Food Engineering Department', 'Indian Institute Of Technology Kharagpur', 'Kharagpur', 'Mallick', 'Bhadoria', 'P.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,French Brewer Uses Algae to Make Blue Beer,"A French beer-making business, or brewery, is using a special kind of bacteria to turn their beer blue.

The beer, sold under the name Line, is an alcoholic drink made by the Hoppy Urban Brew brewery. The brewery was looking for a way to make its drinks different from other kinds of beer. So, the beer maker partnered with Etika Spirulina. It is a business in northern France that wants to popularize its spirulina algae as a dietary aid.

Sebastien Verbeke works at Hoppy Urban Brew. He told Reuters that the beer is selling well. ""It's getting an enormous amount of interest and curiosity on the part of the public,"" he said.

The part of the spirulina that gives the beer its blue color is called phycocyanin. It is added to the beer during the beer-making process.

Brewery worker Mathilde Vanmansart described the taste of the beer as hoppy, light, and a little fruity. She added that the only evidence of the added algae was the blue color.

Xavier Delannoy owns the farm that provides the spirulina. He said after several tests, the brewery had found a mixture that pleased buyers.

He said 1,500 bottles of the blue beer were sold between October and December last year. The brewery is now preparing to increase its production to meet demand.

Who fancies some blue food? Really?

The theory of food colour confusion may originate from us being strongly aroused by foods on the red spectrum. Research published in Nature recently showed that we are more attracted to red coloured foods as they appear to signal better nutrition with higher calories in comparison to blue or green foods. Trichromatic vision evolved in humans as a response to improve foraging and may explain why we rely more on sight than scent when locating the most nutritious foods and fruits that are ripe and ready to eat. This is surprising to us as ‘leafy green’ farmers when we readily assume a green colour relates to health but the Nature study was more assigned to calorific colour arousal. Although our brains may not easily accept the blue colour as natural, our bodies will probably thank us if we do as blue-green algae also known as cyanobacteria has some of the best health benefits. Superfoods: Yogurt with blue Spirulina, Scottish Damsens, Blueberries and Sloes.

One particular cyanobacteria has been studied extensively over the years

Spirulina grows naturally in alkaline waters and was recognised and farmed by ancient civilisations for its medicinal qualities. The Aztecs of Mexico have a long historical relationship with Spirulina. They farmed Spirulina in large lakes, then harvested and air dried the algae to form a hard edible ‘cake’. This was often mixed with other foods and used as an energy source as these ancient people recognised it as an important functional food.

Massive health benefits that many people have still to discover

People who move beyond the colour tend to use blue-green algae for supercharging the immune system, controlling muscle spasms, detoxing heavy metals, eliminating candida, improving memory and increasing energy levels to improve exercise performance. It may also lower cholesterol and blood sugar, acting to prevent heart disease, heal wounds and improve digestion. Pretty impressive qualities for this single celled life form billions of years old.

There are two main species of the blue green algae Spirulina, Arthrospira platensis and Arthrospira maxima. As the image demonstrates, they are made up of single cells containing chlorophyll filled vesicles that react to light and photosynthesize like plants. Cultivation of commercial algae usually starts the life cycle in lab culture tubes, doubling quickly under controlled conditions. This helps to eliminate contaminants. Spirulina is the largest single celled blue green algae and it forms spirals visible to the human eye which bunch together to allow a quick harvest and is now cultivated worldwide as a nutritional supplement.

Spirulina is high in iron, calcium, magnesium, copper, beta-carotene and B-vitamins.

Apart from the high content of protein, Spirulina contains B vitamins, particularly B12 and provitamin A (β-carotenes), and minerals, especially iron. It is also rich in phenolic acids, tocopherols and γ-linolenic acid. Spirulina does not have a cellulose cell wall so it is more easily digested. Most people selling dried Spirulina suggest 1-8g per day to boost the immune system but be careful as too much can have negative effects so it’s best to start with the lowest dose.

Some suggest Spirulina has the power to tackle world wide problems like malnutrition. The UN and WHO recommend Spirulina for it’s extremely high nutritional value and sustainability. It has even been called the ‘world’s most sustainable food’ with the potential to end world hunger. The Pole Pole Foundation in the Congo were finalists in the Earthshot Prize recently. They are leading the way to teach communities in developing countries how to grow Spirulina as a supplement to prevent childhood malnutrition.

Could Spirulina be an alternative vegan protein source?

Would you drink blue milk? Many vegans are looking for alternative sources of protein. Spirulina might even be a protein source of the future and a substitute for cow’s milk. Spirulina platensis stands out for being one of the richest protein sources of microbial origin having similar protein levels when compared to meat and soybeans. Not to be confused with regular green Spirulina in its basic form, blue Spirulina is an extract of the active ingredient phycocyanin in its purest form. This concentrates the dried extract with higher levels of antioxidants without so much of the fishy taste of fresh Spirulina. But if you don’t mind using fresh Spirulina (it’s fishy so it’s much better to mix with stronger flavours) it will provide protein that is quickly and easily absorbed in the body compared to animal proteins which is a bonus as it contains many essential amino acids that the body cannot synthesize alone and are essential for tissue renewal.

Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory

Fresh Spirulina is high in antioxidants, especially phycocyanin, the pigment which causes the blue green colour. Phycocyanin can promote blood cell regeneration, improve lymphocyte activity and improve the lymphatic system. Studies have shown this antioxidant scavenges and fights the free radicals that cause oxidative damage.

Spirulina is known to be alkalizing to the body which boosts beneficial microflora in the gut. Liver function is improved and this greatly increases detoxification levels in the body. Fresh Spirulina contains chlorophyll and phycocyanin both of which help to remove toxins such as heavy metals and other pollutants from the blood. One remarkable study in children who lived close to Chernobyl after the nuclear disaster in 1986 found that giving them a small 5g dose of Spirulina a day could reduce radionuclide rates by half in less than two months.

Spirulina has Cancer fighting benefits

Spirulina has been hailed as an anticancer superfood, but reading further into peer reviewed literature is important as there are some extrapolated and conflicting reports from doing a simple google search. So here we only present peer reviewed data. From our research low dose Spirulina has anti-proliferation effects on stomach cancer cells, human leukaemia cells and B lymphoma cells, inhibiting carcinogenesis.

Eating Spirulina daily may lead to increased energy levels

Fresh Spirulina is particularly good for energy owing to its high nutrient density. Since the algae has no cell wall to break down, digestion of all those nutrients is fast and efficient. It can make a difference to energy levels quickly after consumption. Fresh Spirulina contains constituents such as polysaccharides (Rhamnose and Glycogen) and essential fats that are absorbed easily by cells and theoretically aid energy release. More studies are needed to be truly conclusive though but with low toxicity levels in the body, it’s well worth your own trials.

Spirulina enhances energy performance because it unlocks sugar from our cells. If you are suffering from memory loss, this bacteria added daily to your routine appears to have significant effects. It does this by protecting the brain from free-radical damage by increasing the activity of two enzymes: catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which fight free radicals and make the brain more resistant to aging.

But It’s not all good news

Spirulina may exacerbate autoimmune reactions in some people who are susceptible. As such it may worsen symptoms of multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions linked to overactive immune systems. It’s also not recommended for pregnant women or children or people on blood thinners like warfarin. Be cautious where you purchase Spirulina, as it may be contaminated if not bought from a quality source, leading to additional side effects.

Bioavailability: Should it be dried or is live culture better?

Image credit: Ecoduna, Austria If you search for Spirulina online you are mainly going to encounter powdered products. There is nothing wrong with these as most research was conducted on using powdered forms which still showed positive results. However some reports suggest fresh Spirulina has up to 95% bioavailability. This means that 95% of the nutrients including essential amino acids, all the B vitamins and antioxidants are absorbed straight into your bloodstream increasing potency by 45% compared with powder.

How difficult is it to cultivate and commercialize?

Spirulina cultivation requires sufficient aeration, agitation and proper light intensity for enhanced biomass yield, cell productivity, specific growth rate and protein content. Biomass yield has the potential to reach up to 12g/l biomass in a closed reactor system. Urea seems to be a promising alternative source of low-cost nitrogen for Spirulina cultures and addition of mechanised aeration will significantly increase yields. Spirulina vats in a hothouse, Mexico

But what about algal blooms? Are they the same Cyanobacteria?

Spirulina itself is non toxic but other forms of blue green algae including Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, grown and harvested in the wild, is often contaminated and leads to toxic conditions when out of control.

Blue-green algae occurs naturally in lochs, ponds, reservoirs, rivers and the sea. This summer in Scotland it became a real issue. When the conditions are right, blue green algae will create massive blooms so large they can be captured by satellite imaging from space. Blooms are accelerated by leaching of fertilisers, with nitrogen and phosphorus runoff into the water course which becomes detrimental to other life forms by blocking oxygen and releasing toxic microcystins.

So it’s a logical step to grow these in a controlled environment and if market conditions continue to accelerate consumer demand for functional foods then growing these super algae in CEA could be highly profitable for farmers.

Image credit: Earthrise The largest US producer of Spirulina is based in California and they produce on an open 108 acre site, exporting to over 20 countries worldwide. There are disadvantages of open ponds as they do not reach high biomass productivity due to the difficulty of maintaining the optimum temperature and so they are restricted to tropical and subtropical regions. This is mitigated to some extent with large paddles constantly moving the ponds.

Despite this hefty competition, CEA could be the perfect vehicle for growing a crop that has incredible health properties, sequesters CO2 and can be grown in tubing to eliminate contamination. With LED lights and agitation, enhanced yields could be harvested year round.

This could be particularly useful between the shoulder winter months to increase profits and farm skills where wholesale prices have the potential to return profits of up to $15/Kg . A rough estimate of 12g/L biomass can be achieved with a photobioreactor system incorporating PPFD 166 μmol photons m−2 s−1 with potential doubling every 2-6 days depending on the algal species chosen. Based on this, and assuming you harvest 50% at each doubling time, a microfarm running 100L tanks could harvest 0.6Kg every 2 days, giving a total annual yield of 106.2Kg and a potential maximum annual return of $1593. Scaling up production will make more economic sense. Optimizing and automating additional technology (LED lighting, CO2 enhancement and state of the art infrastructure as seen with Algaennovation) may boost production but this must be carefully managed to balance a return on investment.

Learning and applying new ideas – food, fuel & carbon trap

Image courtesy of Energy Futures living laboratory project, Lille France We like to get people talking about the future diversity of CEA. This helps drive innovation and creates wider jobs and skills. At the same time we aim to help you better understand the science and health prospects of plants that could be grown in CEA. Of all the ideas out there, maybe our favourite is the idea of an algae curtain. Glow in the dark tubes of algae obscure prying eyes from your space while producing your own superfood or fuel. Could plants literally fuel plants in a completely carbon neutral circular economy? Biodiesel produced using algae contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and highly biodegradable. This could have potential in offsetting CEA energy outputs and algae fuel cells could make home farms more economically sustainable in the future. There are so many applications for algae, some are even using it to extract CO2 from brewing. Whatever reason you have for growing Spirulina and others (chlorella) there is no doubt about this being classed as a superfood.

Closer to home we like the way CEA farmers are looking to diversify their product range and kudos to On the Grow farms in Rockwall, Texas, growing spirulina alongside their microgreens. They grow in demijohn bottles adjusting the salinity to 2 and pH 10.5-11, harvesting and topping up fresh water every day. In order to maintain high pH and avoid fluctuations, high amounts of sodium bicarbonate must always be included in the culture medium to buffer the solution. The water needs aeration and temperature needs to be tightly regulated to 80F. LED lights will speed up production and your farm will literally bloom. Image credit: On The Grow Farms, Texas

Spirulina first rose to fame as a potential space food. Maybe in space our brains are altered by gravity to be more accepting of blue food. Or maybe we will discover a whole new superfood bacterial species on Mars or deep in the ocean. So who’s got a spare shelf in their vertical farm for this blue superfood and space age protein milk shake? Janet Colston PhD is pharmacologist with an interest in growing ‘functional’ foods that have additional phytonutrients and display medicinal qualities that are beneficial to human health. She grows these using a range of techniques including plant tissue micropropagation and controlled environmental agriculture to ensure the highest quality control.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,"Spirulina: Uses, Benefits, Side Effects, Dosage, Precautions","Spirulina is a blue-green algae from the genus Arthrospira (""arthro"" roughly meaning ""joint,"" and ""spira"" meaning ""spiral""). It's been used by the Aztecs in Mexico and people living in the Lake Chad area in Africa for centuries. Spirulina's usually cultivated from bodies of water like lakes or farmed in ponds.

Spirulina contains several nutrients, including fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, and K), fatty acids (DHA, EPA), beta carotene and minerals. It's also a source of protein, but it lacks high enough levels of some of the amino acids that your body needs to function at its best (unless you have a medical condition where you need to avoid specific amino acids, like phenylketonuria or ""PKU""). Since spirulina comes from bacteria (specifically ""cyanobacteria""), it may be considered a protein source for vegans.

It's also important to note that the B12 in spirulina is in a different form as ""pseudovitamin B12"" than the type typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs, especially if you follow a vegetarian or vegan way of eating, which can be low in B12. Lower levels of B12 are also found in adults over the age of 60. And why's B12 important? Because your body needs B12 to make red blood cells, it's also crucial for brain and nerve cell development. Not getting enough B12 can cause tiredness, memory loss, depression, and even different types of anemia.

This article takes a closer look at the potential uses of spirulina and the risks associated with its use.

Dietary supplements are not regulated in the United States, meaning the FDA does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement that has been tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn’t mean that they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about any potential interactions with other supplements or medications.

Uses of Spirulina

Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare provider, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD/RDN), or pharmacist. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease.



Spirulina has fat-soluble vitamins (like A, E, and K), beta carotene and minerals, protein, and phycocyanins (pigments that produce a blue color and have shown antioxidant effects). Phycocyanins have been used as a dye in many industries, including pharmacy, culinary, and even cosmetics.

Scientists have studied, but not necessarily proven, spirulina's impact on different areas of health, including but not limited to:

We'll explore what the science says about spirulina's effectiveness for these health outcomes.



Antioxidant capacity

According to a meta-analysis (a collection of research studies) of nine studies with a total of 415 people, spirulina increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The studies used anywhere from one to eight grams of spirulina per day, a pretty extensive range. Many of the studies had a relatively small number of people, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much. The strength of the effects was not earth-shattering and was generally more substantial when people took five grams of spirulina per day or more.

The conclusion? Getting antioxidants from the foods that we eat can help reduce some of the inflammation in our bodies. To amp up antioxidants in your diet, try including a variety of the most nutrient-dense foods that you can source and afford - and they don't have to be organic - like whole grains, fruit, and vegetables to help increase your body's antioxidant capacity and reduce inflammation in your body. Just don't rely on spirulina alone.

Blood pressure

Scientists did a meta-analysis (a collection of several research studies on a topic) of five randomized controlled trials that included 230 people to check spirulina's effects on blood pressure. The people in the different studies took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina a day. The lengths of the studies were anywhere from two to 12 weeks, and many of the studies were pretty small, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much.

When the data was pooled (put together) and analyzed from these studies, the scientists said that spirulina lowered systolic blood pressure by about 4.59 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure 7.02 millimeters of mercury. Systolic pressure (top number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. Diastolic pressure (bottom number) measures the pressure your arteries experience between each heartbeat. The biggest blood pressure-lowering in the studies was seen in people who had high blood pressure already.

The scientists also said more high-quality studies are needed before we can start recommending that everyone with high blood pressure needs to start eating spirulina.

Blood sugar control

Have you ever gotten a jittery feeling after eating sugary food? That usually means your blood sugar's spiking. And this situation can be dire for people coping with conditions like type I or type II diabetes, disordered eating including diabulimia, and more.

Over time, blood sugar spikes that are left uncontrolled can actually lead to damage to your body. Worst case, in certain conditions like diabetes, that can look like having to surgically remove parts of your body (amputation), heart attacks, kidney failure, or stroke, which can lead to paralysis of parts of your body. While spirulina really would not likely be able to correct severe damage from uncontrolled blood sugar over time by itself, it has lowered blood sugar levels in human studies. And why? It could be its protein and fiber content, or perhaps it is phycocyanin's ability to help with inflammation. Scientists are still figuring it out.

Fourteen studies with 510 people with metabolic syndrome–a collection of symptoms like high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (""good cholesterol""), and high waist circumference, which altogether can create more severe health problems–were included in a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on blood sugar and other outcomes. And a lot of those studies didn't have many people in them, meaning they had lower statistical power. People took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina per day. Blood sugar and insulin levels were reduced in some of the studies after taking specific amounts of spirulina. More high-quality studies are needed before healthcare providers can recommend spirulina for lowering blood sugar and insulin levels.

Generally, working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN), particularly a Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist (CDCES), can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. RDs/RDNs can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to avoid spikes in your blood sugar, which could help you feel better. Remember, managing blood sugar can be challenging, and you don't have to do it alone!

Cancer

Unfortunately, very few well-conducted human studies have looked at spirulina's effects on cancer. There've been several studies in test tube cells or in animals that aren't humans. However, more well-constructed studies looking at its effects on humans are needed.



Cholesterol levels

Scientists conducted a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on cholesterol levels that had seven controlled trials for a total of 522 total people. They found that spirulina reduced: total cholesterol (by 46.76 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)), low-density lipoprotein (LDL by 41.32 milligrams per deciliter), and triglycerides (by 44.23 milligrams per deciliter). It also increased the ""good"" cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL by 6.06 milligrams per deciliter). Again, why did spirulina do this? We're not sure, but scientists think it may be due to its nutritional profile (fiber, fatty acids like DHA and EPA), its antioxidant capacity, or a combination of these.



While healthcare providers cannot recommend spirulina for lowering your cholesterol, they can suggest working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) to help you explore your eating patterns, movement, and more. Registered dietitian nutritionists can help you build your toolkit and your capacity. Again, you're not alone!

Liver health

Spirulina has been studied for its effects on liver health in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the study was very small (only 13 people), so we can't draw any conclusions about spirulina for NAFLD until larger and better studies are done.

Metabolic syndrome

Scientists have studied spirulina's effects on metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome happens when you have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist (excess abdominal fat). Metabolic syndrome can wreak havoc with your health and increases your odds of heart attack, stroke, and type two diabetes. One of metabolic syndrome's main causes is thought to be obesity. Obesity, however, can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass.

One spirulina meta-analysis pulled together data from 18 studies. It suggested that spirulina could help lower high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, which are all parts of metabolic syndrome. It's important to note that while spirulina may impact these outcomes, the most essential issue would be working on your current way of eating, your movement (exercise), and other equally important issues like addressing your emotional health. Spirulina can't solve these serious issues.

Consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and perhaps one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. In addition, they can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to help you feel better. Sometimes it can be challenging to give yourself permission to ask for and accept help. But you've got this. And you don't have to go at it alone.

Obesity

In a meta-analysis of five studies, scientists looked at spirulina's effects on weight management in people coping with obesity. Spirulina did decrease weight in people with obesity by 4.55 pounds and in people who were overweight by 2.82 pounds. However, clinically speaking, this is not enough to make a solid recommendation for use of spirulina for obesity treatment.

As mentioned previously, it's important to note that obesity can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass. And BMI does not give the complete picture of an individual's well-being. Consider requesting a body composition test (for example, skin-fold measurements or a DEXA Body Composition scan) from your healthcare provider in addition to other parameters that they may measure.

As mentioned above, consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and, ideally, one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). CSOWM RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. They can help you build your toolkit and your capacity, and help you feel better. You've got this.



What Are the Side Effects of Spirulina?

An allergic reaction may be possible in those allergic to spirulina. Allergic reactions would include rash or swelling. Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience side effects and call your healthcare provider.



Common Side Effects

Spirulina is generally safe, but some people have reported the following with its use:

Allergy

Headache

Muscle pain

Sweating

Trouble sleeping



Severe Side Effects

While severe side effects from spirulina are rare, be aware that the following have occurred:

Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

(severe allergic reaction) Throat swelling

Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience severe side effects and call your healthcare provider.

Precautions

People with phenylketonuria (inability to process the amino acid phenylalanine) and individuals with other amino acid disorders, for example, classical homocystinuria (HCU), or maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), may need to avoid spirulina due to its high protein and thus amino acid content.



The safety of spirulina in pregnant or nursing people has not been established. Speak with your healthcare provider before using spirulina if you're pregnant, plan to get pregnant or if you're breastfeeding.

Please don't give children supplements–including spirulina–without discussing this with their pediatrician first.

Spirulina can sometimes be contaminated with things like lead or other heavy metals (it grows in lakes, after all) or even toxins.



Dosage: How Much Spirulina Should I Take?

Always speak with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement to ensure that the supplement and dosage are appropriate for your individual needs.



Manufacturer recommendations might vary. As a general guideline though, don't use more than what's listed on your product's label. There's no recommended ""effective"" dosage of spirulina. Avoid spirulina if you're allergic or sensitive to it or any of its ingredients. Studies have used from one to 10 grams a day for up to six months to 19 grams of spirulina a day for up two months, with a relatively good safety profile in people with different conditions.



Again, please do not give supplements to children without first discussing this with their pediatrician.

What Happens If I Take Too Much Spirulina?

An upper limit or recommended intake is lacking for spirulina. Taking upwards of 40 grams per day for an unknown period of time has been noted. If you believe that you've taken too much spirulina, contact your healthcare provider for information.



Interactions

Blood thinners: While there are only about 0.26 micrograms of vitamin K in each gram of spirulina, taking far larger amounts could theoretically impact the blood-thinning effects of some medicines like Jantoven (warfarin).

Immunomodulators: Little evidence exists to support avoiding the use of spirulina with immunosuppressive drugs or drugs that change the way that the immune system works (immunomodulators).

It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included. Please review this supplement label with your healthcare provider to discuss any potential interactions with foods, other supplements, and medications.



How to Store Spirulina

Store spirulina in a cool, dry place. Keep spirulina away from direct sunlight. Discard as indicated by the ""use by"" date on the packaging. Keep away from children and pets.



Similar Supplements

Chlorella (a green algae supplement) is somewhat similar to spirulina.

Frequently Asked Questions Is spirulina the same as chlorella? No, chlorella and spirulina are different species of algae, but they're both supplements.

What antioxidants does spirulina have? Spirulina has phycocyanins.

If I'm a vegan, can I get all my protein and B12 needs from spirulina? While spirulina has most of the amino acids that your body needs, it doesn't have enough of some of them. Try to eat a balanced, varied diet to meet your unique protein needs. The B12 in spirulina–pseudovitamin B12–is in a different form than the type that's typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs.

Sources of Spirulina & What to Look For

Blue-green algae species used in spirulina supplements are typically Spirulina maxima, Spirulina platensis, or Aphanizomenon flos-aquae.



Just because a remedy is thought to be ""natural"" does not mean that it is safe. Some ""wild-crafted"" spirulina products may have been grown in water contaminated with heavy metals (mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium) or other pollutants. Opt for supplements produced in labs and certified by third-party authorities like the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF International.



As with all supplements, it's essential to talk with your healthcare provider before using spirulina to decide if it's right for you.



Spirulina Supplements

Spirulina is often sold as a powder. It's also available in capsule, tablet, and liquid form.",,"['Regina C. Windsor', 'Mph', 'Learn About Our', 'Editorial Process']"
phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,Start-up ‘beats the blues’ with spirulina-based food colouring for hot and cold beverages,"The colour blue is rare in nature, and as such, the pigment has been highly sought after – in textiles and paints alike – for millennia.

An ‘eye-catching’ and ‘exciting’ colour, blue has also proved an attractive hue for food and beverage makers. In the drinks category, well-known blue drinks range from blue lagoon cocktails to berry-flavoured soft drinks, blue lattes and functional sports beverages.

As the clean label trend continues apace, consumers are increasingly looking to avoid artificial synthetic colorants. But in the blue category, whether synthetic or natural, Israeli start-up Gavan says both face the same problem.

“Both synthetic blue dyes and plant-based blue colouring have regulatory, stability, intensity, or price challenges,” ​explained Yael Leader, head of product for Gavan.

“The main barrier to creating food formulations with natural colours is stability – the ability to overcome formulation challenges and ensure vibrant and consistent true blue throughout the product’s shelf life.” ​

While delivering a health-stable, naturally derived, vibrant blue for products with low pH is ‘tricky’, as any heat treatment or shift in pH can influence the colour’s shade, Gavan believes it has found the solution in spirulina.

Phycocyanin pigment-protein​

A type of blue-green algae, spirulina contains a pigment-protein known as phycocyanin, which produces a pure blue colour.

Gavan’s proprietary, non-GMO technology extracts phycocyanin and optomises the colourant ‘gently, without damaging the source, and enables the extraction of multiple compounds from the whole spirulina, without waste.

The result is a stable, blue colourant developed from technology that protects it from fading, event at pH as low as 3.0 or when pasteurised at 90°C for 30 seconds, noted the start-up.

“In addition, the platform’s control over particle size offers improved stability throughout the final product’s shelf life.” ​

Fortified drink potential​

Gavan says its platform allows for a ‘full spectrum’ of stable shades of blue, but as blue is a primary colour, it also ‘opens a window’ to producing other colours, from non-chlorophyll green to purple shades.

The start-up’s natural colouring formulation can be used for hot beverages, such as tea and coffee, as well as functional drinks and sports drinks.

“We have experienced quite a hearty demand from companies who are saying their consumers are looking for new experiences They have expressed a desire to widen their colour palates and are becoming more adventurous,” ​Itai Cohen, CEO and co-founder of Gavan, told FoodNavigator.

“This has spurred a growing demand for natural colours, whether blue or green, primarily for categories like functional beverages such as sports drinks and energy drinks and even cocktails.” ​

However, within the functional beverage category, when a large amount of vitamins and minerals can be added, ingredients can react with pigments and accelerate the colour degradation process.

This can cause fading, or create a complex binding of pigments and minerals that can deposit sedimentation in the final application, we were told.

Gavan’s platform provides a solution for the fortified beverages sector, amongst others.

From a clean label perspective, the colourant is marked as ‘spirulina extract’ on ingredients lists. “It complies with FDA-21 CFR US code of federal regulation code title 21,” ​said Cohen.

“The colouring principle complies with section 75.530 spirulina extract.” ​",,['Flora Southey']

This article was previously published April 8, 2019, and has been updated with new information.

In 2018, James DiNicolantonio, co-author of my book, “Superfuel,” published a groundbreaking paper,1 “Antioxidant Bilirubin Works in Multiple Ways to Reduce Risk for Obesity and Its Health Complications.”

Bilirubin is a breakdown product of red blood cells (heme) and the chemical responsible for the yellow color of bruises, urine and jaundice.

In that paper, DiNicolantonio explains how bilirubin inhibits NADPH oxidase (typically abbreviated as NOX) — a metabolic enzyme activated in a large number of pathological conditions that generates a great deal of oxidative stress — and how phycocyanobilin found in spirulina can exert similar effects.

The reason for this is because the phycocyanobilin found in spirulina is rapidly reduced to phycocyanorubin, a close homolog of bilirubin, in mammalian cells.2,3 In a follow-up paper4 published March 2019, DiNicolantonio, et.al, propose that elevated bilirubin might aid weight control by preventing the development of leptin resistance, and discuss evidence suggesting spirulina may be an effective way to combat leptin resistance as well.

Bilirubin Can Play a Role in Chronic Disease

When a newborn baby gets jaundice, he is placed under “bili lights” in the hospital nursery to prevent brain damage (kernicterus), should his bilirubin levels become too high. The blue lights break down the bilirubin so it can be excreted. However, at appropriate levels, bilirubin has a strong free radial scavenging effect.

Until recently, scientists were unaware that bilirubin may actually have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and atheroprotective properties, and there is a growing body of scientific and clinical evidence to support this.

From an evolutionary/biological perspective, it also makes sense that nature would have created a way for your body to break down heme,5 which can be toxic if it accumulates. The way bilirubin is thought to provide these health benefits is through its ability to inhibit NOX.

In fact, NOX overactivity appears to play a significant role in a wide range of health conditions, including but not limited to vascular diseases and vascular complications of other diseases (diabetes, kidney failure, blindness and heart disease, for example), insulin resistance, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, cancer, glaucoma, pulmonary fibrosis and erectile dysfunction.

It follows then that preventing many chronic diseases would require finding a means of inhibiting or modulating NOX. Bilirubin is believed to assist with this modulating effect.

People with Gilbert Syndrome comprise 3 to 7% of the population6,7 and illustrate this phenomenon quite nicely, as they are genetically predisposed to chronically elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin.

These individuals, having two to three times as much bilirubin as the rest of us after a 24-hour fast,8 enjoy a greatly reduced risk for coronary artery disease, hypertension, carotid atherosclerosis and overall mortality, and this protection is thought to be related to their high bilirubin levels.9

Spirulina — An Effective NADPH Oxidase Inhibitor

Since phycocyanobilin is a very close relative of bilirubin — and spirulina is a great source of phycocyanobilin — spirulina has enormous clinical potential due to its NOX inhibiting effect. This is why phycocyanobilin has been the focus of a large amount of research.

Phycobilin extracts have been shown to inhibit NOX activity in human aortic endothelium, aortic smooth muscle and renal cell cultures. And bilirubin protects against diabetic nephropathy via downregulation of NOX in rats.

As DiNicolantonio’s 2018 paper10 explains, bilirubin reduces the risk for obesity and related health problems through a number of mechanisms, but primarily by inhibiting NOX complexes.

Downregulating NOX activity — which can be done with spirulina, thanks to its bilirubin-mimicking phycocyanobilin — could therefore have “profound implications for preservation of metabolic and vascular health.” As further explained by the authors:

“Expression of inducible form of heme oxygenase, HO-1, can be boosted by oxidative stress — often derived from NADPH oxidase [NOX] activity; the resultant production of bilirubin feeds back to quell this oxidative stress …

[Phycocyanobilin, which is covalently attached to phycocyanin] is readily converted by biliverdin reductase to the bilirubin analogue phycocyanorubin, which appears to share bilirubin’s ability to inhibit NADPH oxidase [NOX] complexes. Arguably, this may largely explain the versatile antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of oral spirulina … in rodent studies …

A recent cross-sectional epidemiological study evaluating subjects with [Gilbert Syndrome] has discovered that [Gilbert Syndrome] is associated with a reduced tendency to gain body fat in later life … A reasonable deduction is that chronically elevated free unconjugated bilirubin — and perhaps an upregulation in intracellular bilirubin generation — somehow opposes age-related gain in body fat.

Of related interest is a study showing that intraperitoneal administration of bilirubin — administered daily for 14 days — inhibits weight gain in rats fed a diet high in fats and sugar. Bilirubin injections were also found to prevent deterioration of glucose tolerance …

A credible case can be made that the favorable impact of elevated bilirubin on risk for undesirable weight gain reflects preservation of hypothalamic leptin sensitivity …

Activation of NADPH oxidase [NOX] is a key mediator of proinflammatory microglial activation; hence, elevated bilirubin might be expected to support effective leptin function in the arcuate nucleus, thereby aiding appetite control.

Oxidative stress in adipocytes, stemming largely from NADPH oxidase [NOX] activity, appears to play a key role in the induction of insulin resistance and the skewing of adipokine and cytokine production in hypertrophied adipocytes.

Hence, bilirubin and heme oxygenase activity could be expected to aid maintenance of adipocyte insulin sensitivity. Indeed, plasma levels of unconjugated bilirubin have been found to correlate inversely with risk for metabolic syndrome and diabetes in prospective epidemiological studies, as confirmed in a recent meta-analysis.

In both cross-sectional and prospective studies, higher plasma bilirubin levels are associated with better insulin sensitivity and decreased risk for metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes — independent of BMI … A direct protective effect of bilirubin on adipocyte function may be largely responsible for this phenomenon.”

Leptin Resistance: A Hallmark of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes

In order for you to significantly gain weight, you must first become leptin resistant. Leptin is a hormone that helps you regulate your appetite. When your leptin levels rise, it signals your body that you’re full, so you’ll stop eating.

However, as you become increasingly resistant to the effects of leptin, you end up eating more. The question then is: what drives this basic process? Why do you become leptin resistant in the first place?

Research by Dr. Richard Johnson — head of nephrology at the University of Colorado who has published more than 500 medical papers and written a number of books on obesity — clearly shows that refined sugar (in particular fructose) is exceptionally effective at causing leptin resistance in animals and blocks the burning of fat.

Most overweight Americans have some degree of insulin and leptin resistance. This also includes people with diabetes, and many individuals with high blood pressure or high cholesterol. If you fall into this category, it would be prudent for you to restrict fructose to about 15 to 25 grams per day from all sources.

In his most recent paper,11 DiNicolantonio and his co-authors hypothesize that spirulina supplementation may also be an effective treatment for leptin resistance.

Bilirubin Protects Against Weight Gain

As mentioned earlier, people with Gilbert Syndrome are genetically predisposed to chronically elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin. This not only appears to protect them from heart disease and overall mortality, but also prevents body fat accumulation, especially during later years, and hypothalamic leptin resistance is one known condition that promotes weight gain as you grow older.12

Research has shown that leptin injections have no effect on obesity. “Studies in rodents with diet-induced obesity suggest that this phenomenon reflects a loss of leptin responsiveness that is specific to the arcuate nucleus,” DiNicolantonio notes.13

Research also suggests that diet-induced obesity is related to the activation of microglia (glial cells that function as scavengers) in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH).14 Again, NOX plays an important role. Activation of microglia also leads to the production of toxic oxidants such as peroxynitrite and other proinflammatory cytokines.

As noted by DiNicolantonio, “Hence, it is straightforward to propose that bilirubin may have the ability to downregulate microglial activation by diminishing NADPH oxidase activation.” That said, bilirubin does not appear to be able to influence leptin activity until or unless leptin resistance has actually developed.

Spirulina May Combat Leptin Resistance by Mimicking Bilirubin

Now, while raising your bilirubin level could potentially protect you from obesity and diabetes, it’s not a useful nutraceutical in and of itself, and this is where spirulina comes in, as the phycocyanobilin found in spirulina is very similar to bilirubin. DiNicolantonio sums it up as follows:15

“If the hypothesis presented here is correct, the far lower body fat in older subjects with Gilbert Syndrome reflects the ability of bilirubin to suppress the activation and proliferation of microglia in the MBH.

The extent to which this expansion of activated microglia — and the associated impact on the function of leptin-responsive neurons — can be reversed by elevation of bilirubin (or administration of phycocyanobilin) in patients who have already developed obesity with leptin resistance remains to be seen.

Particularly because microglial mass increases, it may be rash to assume that this syndrome is fully reversible. If phycocyanobilin does prove to have utility for controlling hypothalamic inflammation, its greatest impact on obesity will likely be achieved by long-term administration in a preventive mode.

In any case, studies evaluating the impact of bilirubin or phycocyanobilin administration on the development of hypothalamic leptin resistance in fat-fed rodents appear to be warranted … Two studies have been published very recently in which inclusion of spirulina in the diet has been shown to inhibit gain in body weight and fat in rats fed a high-fat diet; these appear to be the first studies to have evaluated spirulina’s impact in this regard.

Although neither of these studies focused on leptin function, the fact that markers of adipose tissue browning were higher in rats receiving spirulina is consistent with effective leptin function in these rats.

Moreover, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial has also emerged, in which spirulina supplementation (at only 2 grams daily) was found to potentiate loss of body fat, body weight, waist circumference and BMI in overweight subjects placed on a calorie-restricted diet; reductions in triglycerides and C reactive protein were also greater in the spirulina group.

Bilirubin mimesis [imitation or mimicry] may represent one example of a more general strategy for preventing or reversing inappropriate weight gain: counteracting hypothalamic leptin resistance or upregulating hypothalamic leptin signaling.”

Spirulina Types, Dosing and Potential Adverse Reactions

There are many types of spirulina on the market, so do your homework before making a purchase. Since spirulina grown in an uncontrolled environment has the potential to become contaminated with heavy metals and other toxins, it is important to choose organic spirulina from a reputable source.

Spirulina comes in capsules, tablets, powders and flakes. Dosing depends on what you plan to use it for and to whom it is given. A general starting dose for adults is typically around 3 grams. For disease prevention, you may work your way up to 20 grams per day. The adult maintenance dose is typically around 10 grams a day.

Remember to increase your intake of spring water or filtered water when taking spirulina to help it absorb into your system. Also be aware that spirulina is a potent detoxifier, so depending on your toxic burden, you may or may not experience a detox reaction. For that reason, it is best to start with a small dose and work your way up.

Though there are no known side effects associated with spirulina, your body may react to it based on your current state of health. Some of the most prominent reactions you may experience include:

Slight fever — The high protein content in spirulina increases metabolism, which may elevate body temperature Dark green stool — Spirulina can remove accumulated waste products in your colon, which may cause darker stool. Also, spirulina is high in chlorophyll, which turns your stool green Gas — Buildup of gas may indicate that your digestive system is not functioning properly Excitability — Your body is converting protein into heat energy, which may cause temporary feelings of restlessness Breakouts and/or itchy skin — This is caused by the colon cleansing process and is a temporary reaction Sleepiness — This is caused by the detoxification process and may indicate your body is exhausted and needs more rest

Also keep in mind that while spirulina is entirely natural and generally considered a healthy food, there are some important contraindications you need to be aware of. Avoid spirulina if you are:16

Severely allergic to seafood

Allergic to iodine

Pregnant

Nursing

If you have hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), consult your health care provider before taking spirulina. Also avoid taking spirulina if you are currently running a fever, as it may raise it further. Also, do not take spirulina if you have an autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, or if you a metabolic condition called phenylketonuria (PKU).

Chlorella — An Alternative if You Can’t Tolerate Spirulina

Chlorella is another form of algae that is sometimes confused with spirulina. The fundamental difference between spirulina and chlorella is that spirulina does not possess the hard cell wall that makes chlorella closer to a plant than algae. Note, however, that chlorella does not have the phycocyanobilin so it will not inhibit NOX and increase NADPH.

Chlorella is an excellent way to detoxify your body from mercury, a common problem if you have amalgam dental fillings, have received a thimerosal-containing vaccine or regularly eat contaminated fish. It is also one of nature’s highest source of chlorophyll, which has many biological benefits.

Spirulina is unable to remove heavy metals, as it lacks a cell membrane. It can, however, protect your liver against the toxic effects of heavy metals, and help eliminate other toxins, including arsenic. If for whatever reason you cannot tolerate spirulina, chlorella could be a viable alternative to obtain some of its benefits described above.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,"Buoys placed in Lake Erie, act as floating laboratories","CLEVELAND — Four high-tech buoys acting as floating laboratories are placed in central Lake Erie each May to collect data, monitor water quality and much more.

What You Need To Know Four smart buoys monitor water quality in central Lake Erie as part of the Smart Lake Erie Watershed Initiative



It’s a collaborative project from Cleveland Water Alliance, Cleveland Water, and Limnotech



The buoys help give the water department advance notice of potential water quality issues and much more



Other industries such as fishing and boating use the public data from the buoys ​

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 11 million people depend on Lake Erie for drinking water, including about 3 million people in Ohio and about 1.4 million in Cleveland.

Scott Moegling, the water quality manager for Cleveland Water, looks forward to the day each year when the four smart buoys are placed in central Lake Erie to collect data on water conditions.

“They're expensive, but they're worth it. We've learned a lot of good information, and a better understanding of Lake Erie and and water quality in the water that we treat,"" Moegling said. ""If you'd have told me 30 years ago that I'd be looking at satellite imagery and using remote laboratories out in the lake to help me treat water, I probably would have laughed and said no way, but here we are.”

The buoys are deployed by environmental scientists from Limnotech, the water science and engineering firm which engineers the buoys. The first buoy deployed in 2010, then the next came in 2016 and two more last year.

“This one is going to go out three-and-a-half miles. We've got one that's 12 miles out they're putting out right now,"" he said. ""We'll have another one over at Nottingham, it'll be about three-and-a-half miles and then one over at our Crown Water Plant over off of Westlake, that one will be about three miles offshore.”

The buoys’ gathered information is sent to an online monitoring system 24 hours a day where it is viewed by Cleveland Water staff and the public. The buoys help give the water department hours of advanced notice of a water quality issue long before the water is drawn into a treatment plant.

“By getting that extra lead time, we can not only gear up manpower, we can gear up chemicals, we can anticipate needed changes,” Moegling said. “We can increase testing and be more vigilant when we know that something may be coming at us.”

The sensors on the buoys track a variety of things including temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, phycocyanin, which is a blue-green algae pigment, chlorophyll, which is an algae pigment, and other things that the water department can use to identify water quality parameters they need for treatment.

The data isn’t just useful to the water department. Many other industries like fishing and boating benefit. Moegling said the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and the Coast Guard use the buoys' data.

“The fishing industry, they'll use our dissolved oxygen data and to identify where to go fish, you know, if there's a low oxygen then the fish won't be there,” Moegling said. “Boaters use it, the wave height, wave period, the wind speed and directions are important for boaters.”

In 2021, Cleveland Water Alliance (CWA), Cleveland Water, and LimnoTech activated the Smart Lake Erie Watershed, an award-winning regional smart water monitoring network. It's the first of it's kind in the nation and is used to inform and improve public health, safety, utility operations, supply chain management, and water security throughout Greater Cleveland. Because of this advanced technology, Lake Erie is one of the most studied and digitally-connected bodies of freshwater on earth. Moegling said other organizations have their own smart buoys deployed on the lake as well for other reasons.

“It’s great that we have this beautiful resource right here for us to use and to enjoy and to recreate on,” Moegling said. “We’re getting a better understanding about the lake itself. Once we understand that, and understand all the complexities of the lake, then we can manage it better.”

The organization asks that people stay at least 100 feet away from the buoys, especially fishermen who are trawling behind their boats.

“Cleveland water has great treatment,” Moegling said. “We put out high quality water that meets all the regulations and then beyond. And we're really proud of the quality of water that we're able to put out.”

phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,The Use of Algae to Reduce CO2 Emissions,"The high emission of greenhouse gases has been one of the foremost global threats with far-reaching consequences. Algae are photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms that are categorized as microalgae (unicellular) and macroalgae (multicellular) based on their size. Scientists have indicated that algae are extremely important to reach the global aim of zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Image Credit: Chokniti Khongchum/Shutterstock.com

Since the industrial revolution, global carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions have escalated from 9.34 billion metric tons in 1960 to 36.44 billion metric tons in 2019. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has pointed out that some of the major contributors to atmospheric carbon dioxide are electricity and heat production, agriculture, forestry, industry, and transportation.

The United Nations Environment Programme stated that to prevent global warming to reach more than 1.5 ⁰C, the world would need to lower carbon emissions by roughly 7.6% annually for the upcoming decades.

Some of the recent strategies used to reduce the level of CO 2 from the atmosphere involve bio capturing of CO 2 and bioconversion to valuable products and renewable energy.

Capturing carbon is also known as sequestration, which involves taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, decarbonizing industries, and promoting clean fossil energy production. These strategies could effectively mitigate rapid climate change and global warming.

Strategies to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emission

Algae are fast-growing aquatic organisms that are commonly found as seaweed, pond scum, and giant kelp. Scientists stated that one of the most sustainable strategies to capture and store CO 2 from the atmosphere is photosynthesis.

Several studies have indicated that microalgae have exhibited maximum carbon-fixing capabilities. These studies have shown that microalgae can capture around 100 Gt of CO 2 into biomass annually.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies have been indispensable in both fossil fuels- and biofuels-based power plants. This is because these technologies help to lower CO 2 emissions from power generation by capturing carbon during pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion. Although extensive research is being conducted to develop advanced conventional CCS technologies, public acceptance of this technology is still low.

As transportation and logistics sectors have been key contributors to CO 2 emission, scientists believe that this emission can be significantly reduced via capturing and storing of CO 2 onboard. Importantly, this system of recycling captured CO 2 is similar to conventional fuel production from renewable energy sources. In addition, it can capture 90% of the emitted CO 2 without any energy penalty.

Some of the drawbacks of the conventional CCS technologies involve high energy consumption, difficulties associated with transportation, immediate utilization of captured CO 2 , and a high possibility of leakage into the atmosphere during storage. The key advantages of microalgae-based CCS technologies are that they eliminate the above-mentioned limitation of conventional CCS technologies. Another advantage of this system is that compared to conventional CCS technologies, its operational cost is significantly low and is an eco-friendly strategy.

Microalgae and Lowering of Carbon Dioxide Emission

Blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), green algae, red algae, and diatoms are commonly referred to as microalgae. These organisms have been used for capturing carbon dioxide and sequestration.

At present, scientists have been involved in bio-capturing carbon dioxide using algae, and conversion of microalgae biomass containing CO 2 into energy (biofuel) or other value-added products. This field of science, involving carbon dioxide mitigation, bioconversion, and circular carbon economy, is fast evolving.

Microalgae-based carbon capture technology is dependent on the species of microalgae, cultivation systems, and growth conditions (e.g., temperature, culture medium, pH, salinity, turbidity, light intensity, etc.). Optimization of algal growth also impacts the concentration of CO 2 captured, for example, an increase of pH from 7.9 to 9.5 has led to a reduction of CO 2 by two orders of magnitude.

Scientists have reported that Chlorella exhibited promising CO 2 capturing capacity. This algal species can grow in an atmosphere containing 40% (v/v) CO 2 with a fixation rate of 0.77 to 2.22 g/L/day.

Oscillatoria, a freshwater alga, also possesses the capacity to reduce carbon dioxide. Some of the advantages of using this alga in integrated biorefineries include its tolerance to high temperatures, toxic gases, and the possibility to produce high-value products.

Researchers reported that at an optimal temperature of 25-30°C and pH between 7 and 9, Oscillatoria exhibited significantly higher CO 2 capture capacity. Several studies have shown Scenedesmus sp and Chlorococcum sp can be used to capture CO 2 present in effluents and those emitted from industrial activities.

Conversion of Captured CO 2 by the Microalgae

The CO 2 captured from the atmosphere by microalgae via photosynthesis is stored in its biomass. It is converted to value-added products, such as bioenergy (e.g., biogas), bio-oil, biochar, and syngas.

Although the potential of microalgae to capture carbon is significantly high, other low-value bulk products, such as proteins for food application and fatty acids for nutraceuticals, are not feasible. However, recently, researchers have developed a concept of integrated bio-refinery using a microalgae-based biological carbon-capture approach that enables enhancement in the availability of biomass feedstock as well as extraction of high value-added products.

Various high-value and low-value marketable products are obtained from integrated biorefinery systems that include biofuel, i.e., biodiesel, biogas, bioethanol, and butanol. Additionally, algal pigments, such as chlorophyll a and b, phycobilins, lutein, astaxanthin, β-carotene, and C- phycocyanin, are widely applied in dyes, cosmetics, food and feed additives, pharmaceutical and nutraceuticals. Microalgae are also considered to be a rich source of amino acids, vitamins, fatty acids, and carbohydrates.

Challenges Associated with Capturing Carbon by Microalgae

Microalgae need to be cultivated outdoor and, thereby, the varying environmental conditions influence their growth.

Most of the research and development associated with carbon capture using microalgae is still in the laboratory phase, but researchers are optimistic about developing large-scale outdoor devices for optimal algal cultivation.

More research is required to understand the CO 2 absorption process around the cell membrane of microalgae. During algal cultivation, there is a risk of contamination by certain bacterial and fungal species.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,In vitro and in vivo anti-cancer effects of hibernating common carp (Cyprinus carpio) plasma on metastatic triple-negative breast cancer,"Preparation of the fish for hibernation

All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Isfahan (IR.UI.REC.1398.072). Alive adult common carps (mean weight: 1670 ± 240 g, mean length: 34.4 ± 7.9 cm) were purchased from a local fish farm in Isfahan provenance, Iran. They were placed in a 200-L plastic tank with circulating aerated water (Temperature: 20 °C, Flow rate: 500 L/h, Dissolved oxygen: > 5 mg/L) for one month. After acclimation period, the fish were randomly divided into two groups including non-hibernating and hibernating. Non-hibernating fish were kept in the same containers and conditions (Temperature: 20 °C). The hibernation protocol was done according to previous studies13,26,50. The fish were induced into a hibernated state by gradient cooling of water at the rate of 1–2 °C until 3 °C in water tanks located in a temperature-controlled cold room and maintained at this temperature during the winter. Then, we separately put the fish of each groups in a water tank containing eugenol (4-allyl-2 methoxy phenol, the active component of clove oil, 40 mg/L) to anesthetize them. Anesthesia of fish is characterized by the complete loss of balance, immobility, and failure to respond to strong external stimuli, such as intense touch and vibration of the tail area51. The fish were anesthetized by eugenol (40 mg/L) and blood was collected from the caudal vasculature. Subsequently, plasma was isolated, separately pooled together for each group, lyophilized and stored at -80° C for further use.

Cell culture

The murine triple-negative mammary cancer (4T1) and normal murine fibroblast (L929) cell lines were obtained from the Pasteur Institute (Tehran, Iran). 4T1 and L929 cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at standard cell culture condition (37 °C, 5% CO2).

MTT assay

The cell viability of 4T1 and L929 cells was evaluated using MTT (3-(4 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Briefly, cells were allowed to grow to 80% confluency. The cells were detached using 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution (GIBCO, USA) and seeded in 96-well culture plates at density of 5 × 103 cells/well. After 24 h incubation, different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 mg/ml) of lyophilized plasma of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp dissolved in culture medium were added to each wells. After 24, 48, and 72 h of cells seeding in 96 -well plate, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then media were replaced with a basal culture medium containing 0.005% MTT solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). After 4 h incubation (37 °C, 5% CO2) in the dark, the medium was discarded and the precipitated formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Finally, the absorbance of each well was detected by an Absorbance Microplate Reader (BioTek-ELX800, USA) at the wavelength of 570 nm. According to the following equation, the percentage of cell viability was calculated by relative value to the untreated cells (0 mg/ml) as the control group. The experiment was repeated three times and at least six wells were used for each concentration.

$$ Cell \,Viablity\, \left( \% \right) = \frac{{\left( {OD \,Sample - OD \,Blank} \right)}}{{\left( {OD \,Control - OD \,Blank} \right)}} \times {1}00 $$

Morphological assessment

4T1 and L929 cells were separately seeded in 6-well culture plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h. Then, the wells were washed three times with PBS (Sigma, USA). An inverted phase-contrast light microscope (Olympus, Japan) was used to capture photographs before treatment. Then, the wells were divided into three groups including control, hibernating plasma, and non-hibernating plasma. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group, while the cells of hibernating plasma group were treated with the optimal hibernating plasma concentration selected from the MTT assay (16 mg/ml). The same concentration of non-hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) was used to treat the cells of hibernating plasma group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. After 24 h, the wells were washed three times with PBS and microscopic photographs were captured to evaluate changes in cellular morphology.

Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining assay

The dual-fluorescent AO/EB staining assay was used to evaluate the cell viability as well as apoptosis. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with the optimal hibernating and non-hibernating plasma concentration (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. Then, the wells were washed three times with PBS and stained with 100 µl AO/EB mixture solution containing 100 µg/ml acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 100 µg/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in PBS for 30 min in the dark. Finally, an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan) was used to capture images.

Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) staining assay

Apoptosis rate was determined by the apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences, USA) according to previous study52. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a concentration of 1 × 105 and incubated overnight. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 16 mg/ml hibernating plasma or the same concentration of non-hibernating plasma for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. The cells were detached and washed three times with cold PBS (1X, pH 7.4) and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min. Then, the cells were resuspended in binding buffer (100 µl), stained with 5 µl of Annexin V-FITC and the same volume of PI, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Subsequently, the volume of each sample was increased to 500 μl by adding binding buffer and the cells were immediately analyzed (104 cells/sample) using flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, USA). This experiment was independently repeated three times and the obtained data were analyzed by the FlowJo-V10 software.

Cell cycle analysis

The Tali™ cell cycle kit (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, USA) was performed to determine the percentage of cells at each stage of the cell cycle. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 and incubated overnight. Subsequently, the cells were treated with hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) or non-hibernating plasma (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. After that, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice with cold PBS. Then, they were fixed with dropwise addition of 70% ice-cold ethanol (1 ml) while gentle vortexing and stored at -20 °C overnight. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min. Then, the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of Tali™ cell cycle solution. Finally, it was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The DNA content of stained cells was analyzed using flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, USA) for each sample. This experiment was independently repeated three times and the results were displayed as histograms. The obtained data were analyzed by the FlowJo-V10 software.

Wound healing assay

The wound healing (or scratch) assay was carried out for cell migration analysis. 4T1 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates and incubated for 48 h to grow to 80% confluency. Then, the cell layer was scratched by a sterile P200 Micropipette tip. The wells were washed twice with PBS to remove the debris and smoothing the edges of the scratch. Next, the cells were incubated with RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.5% FBS and treated with the optimal hibernating or non-hibernating plasma concentration (16 mg/ml) for 24 h. The untreated cells (0 mg/ml) were used as the control group. At least, three wells were prepared for each group. The photographs were obtained from the selected regions using an inverted phase-contrast light microscope (Olympus, Japan) at 0 h (immediately after media replacement) and 24 h after treatment with hibernating and non-hibernating plasma. The Wound Healing Size Tool, as an ImageJ/Fiji1 plugin, was used to quantifying the wound area53. The following equation was used to calculate the wound closure percentage.

$$ Wound\; closure\, \% = \left. {\left( {\frac{Initial\; wound\; area - Final\; wound\; area }{{Initail\; wound\; area}}} \right.} \right) \times 100 $$

Cancer cells implantation and tumor challenge

All animal experiments and procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Isfahan (IR.UI.REC.1398.072). A total of 54 female Balb/c mice (mean weight: 23 ± 2 g) were purchased from the Royan Institute of Isfahan, Iran. The mice were housed in standard cages with controlled temperature (24 ± 2 ºC), relative humidity (50 ± 10%), 12-h light–dark cycle, and ad libitum access to enough food and water. It should be mentioned that standardized humane endpoints based on the current guidelines for endpoints in animal tumor studies were used54,55,56. After two weeks of acclimation, the mice's belly hair was shaved and disinfected with 70% alcohol. 1.5 × 106 4T1 cells suspended in 50 µl of basal culture medium were subcutaneously injected into the fourth left mammary fat pad of each mouse. When the tumor size reached 50–70 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into three groups including control, hibernating plasma, and non-hibernating plasma. The control group of mice was intratumorally injected with PBS (200 µl), while the other groups were respectively treated with intratumoral (i.t) injection of hibernating plasma (200 µl, 16 mg/ml) and non-hibernating plasma (200 µl, 16 mg/ml) once every day for 18 days. For tumor growth analysis, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor volume was calculated using the following equation.

$$ Tumor\; volume = \frac{{\left( {Tumor\; length} \right) \times \left( {Tumor\; width} \right)^{2} }}{2} $$

The greatest longitudinal diameter (length) and the greatest transverse diameter (width) of tumors were measured by a digital caliper (Neiko, USA) every three days. Besides, the body weights of tumor-bearing mice were measured. For survival analysis, 24 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 8). The tumor-bearing mice were closely monitored for 60 days after tumor implantation. The animals’ death was recorded every day. The failure to eat and drink for over 3 days and a lack of limb movement were considered as the standardized humane endpoint used to euthanize animals by an overdose of ketamine/xylazine solution.

Metastasis analysis

Metastasis is the main cause of death for cancer patients57,58. For metastasis analysis, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor implantation and treatment approaches were as described in the previous section. The mice were sacrificed by overdose of ketamine/xylazine and their liver and lungs were harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution 40 days after cancer cell implantation. An automatic tissue processor (Sakura, Japan) was employed to process the fixed samples. Then, a microtome (Leica Biosystems, Germany) was utilized to cut 4 µm thickness serial sections from the paraffin-embedded blocks. The sections were stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining protocol for subsequent histological evaluation59. A minimum of 10 random microscopic fields was observed under the 10 × objective lens of a light microscope (Olympus, Japan) to report the mean number of metastatic colonies per microscopic field of the liver. Furthermore, the occupied area by metastatic colonies in each microscopic field of the liver (magnification × 100) was quantified by the Qupath software. The mean percentage of occupied space by liver metastatic colonies in each microscopic field was reported for each sample. Besides, all over the H&E stained sections of lungs were analyzed for counting metastatic colonies.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical staining of the proliferation marker Ki-67 was carried out to evaluate the anti-proliferative effect of hibernating plasma on 4T1 breast tumors. This biomarker is commonly used in the clinic for identifying the prognosis and effectiveness of treatment in patients60,61. For the analysis of Ki-67, 15 Balb/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and randomly divided into the above-mentioned three groups (n = 5). The tumor implantation and treatment approaches were as described in the previous section. The mice were sacrificed with the overdose of ketamine/xylazine solution after 18 days and the tumors were harvested. After 24 h fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin, the specimens were processed by an automatic tissue processor (Sakura, Japan), followed by routine methods for subsequent histological evaluation. The sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti-Ki-67 antibody (Biolegend, USA) at 4 °C overnight. The sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG followed by incubation with streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (HRP). After three times wash, the sections were incubated with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) tetrahydrochloride and followed by a counterstain with hematoxylin62. The photographs of slides were taken by using a digital light microscope (Olympus, Japan), and the percentage of tumor cells that were positive for the Ki-67 as a proliferation biomarker was quantified using ImageJ software63.

Analysis of plasma proteins by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS)

Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate–Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out to analyze the plasma proteins of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp. Firstly, 1 mg of the lyophilized plasma of hibernating and non-hibernating common carp was separately dissolved in 1 ml PBS buffer. Protein concentration of the lyophilized plasma was determined using a microplate reader (BioTek-Synergy HT, USA). Then, 15 µl of dissolved lyophilized plasma was mixed with 5 µl of sample loadings buffer for SDS-PAGE (1X; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. After that, 20 µl of this solution was loaded into each well of the gel (12% SDS-PAGE). The gels were electrophoresed at 70 V for 30 min and then at 130 V for 1.5 h using a SDS gel running buffer. The molecular weight marker of the protein (ranging from 5–232 KDa) included Insulin (5 KDa), Ribonuclease A (13 KDa), Chymotrypsinogen A (25 KDa), Ovalbumin (43 KDa), Bovin Serum Albumin (67 KDa), Aldolase (158 KDa), Catalase (232 KDa) was loaded in a lane next to the plasma samples. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 45 min at 25 °C after electrophoresis. Hot water and a shaker (IKA-Werke, Germany) were used to decolorize the gel. Finally, the gels were imaged using a Bio-5000 Plus gel imaging scanner (Zhongjing Microtek, Shanghai, China), and the density of protein bands was measured by Image J Software. The 158 KDa band cut off from the gel and send for the high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS) analysis performed by Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC-Micromass Quattro micro API Mass Spectrometer.

Statistical analysis

The data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc tests were used to evaluate the significance of the difference between groups, by employing the JMP 14.0 software (SAS Institute, Japan). The difference was considered statistically significant if P < 0.05. (*: P < 0.05, ns: not significant). The Kaplan–Meier curves were drawn and analyzed by JMP software, using the Log-Rank test to assess the significant differences between the mean survival time of tumor-bearing mice in different groups.

Ethical approval

All animal experiments and procedures were conducted according to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the University of Isfahan, which refer to the American Association for Laboratory Animals Science and the guidelines laid down by the NIH (NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals) and also ARRIVE guidelines. All experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Isfahan, Iran (IR.UI.REC.1398.072).",,"['Golpich', 'Department Of Plant', 'Animal Biology', 'Faculty Of Biological Science', 'Technology', 'University Of Isfahan', 'Isfahan', 'Amini', 'Department Of Cell', 'Molecular Biology']"
phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,"Venus sounds like the last place for life, but…could photosynthesis happen in its clouds?","Raging with unbearable heat and covered in swirls of toxic clouds, Venus is a hell world for humans. But something might actually be able to live in its atmosphere.

The clouds of sulfuric acid above Venus could — at least hypothetically — be a haven for photosynthesis. No alien algae or other photosynthetic organisms have actually been found there yet, but biochemist Rakesh Mogul of California State Polytechnic University recently led a study, published in Astrobiology, about how this could happen. What is poison for one life-form could make it possible for another to survive.

Venus is a place where even spacecraft fear to tread. Every lander that has touched the radiation-blasted surface has met an untimely death. Far above that surface, its skies might have some hidden advantages for hypothetical phototrophs, organisms that use light as an energy source to power up their metabolisms.

“We found that several packets of wavelengths, which pass through Venus’ atmosphere, overlap with the absorption properties of many terrestrial photosynthetic pigments,” he tells SYFY WIRE. “The light that remains in the clouds represents the groups of wavelengths available for photosynthesis.”

Phycocyanin, which gives cyanobacteria (aka blue-green algae) its unearthly blue color, could possibly thrive in the Venusian clouds, since it can absorb the wavelengths of light that come through. These wavelengths are similar to those that can be absorbed by photosynthetic organisms on Earth. (Some people swear by it as a supplement. No, really.) So could bacteriochlorophyll b, which offers an assist to organisms that photosynthesize wavelengths of light that most plants and cyanobacteria cannot use. These phototropic bacteria do not release oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis.

Searching for extraterrestrial life means recognizing substances and processes close to those on our planet while also being prepared to find life as we don’t know it or don’t usually recognize it. After light scatters through Earth’s atmosphere, what is available for photosynthesis remains on the surface as opposed to the leftovers lingering in the clouds of Venus. However, heat from the infernal surface of Venus rises up to the atmosphere. Both that and heat in the atmosphere itself include photons whose wavelengths are an asset to some photosynthetic pigments.

While that might sound conducive to something like algae or phytoplankton thriving, how could they make it in noxious clouds of sulfur dioxide that are constantly irradiated by the Sun?

“The clouds in Venus have substantial abundances of sulfur dioxide and other unidentified chemical species that absorb and scatter UV and visible radiation, scrubbing the atmosphere of most of the harmful UV rays,” Mogul says.

What results from this is ammonium bisulfate and other neutralized forms of sulfuric acid that were observed to show higher water activity than what was previously assumed. This is because of molecular properties that have certain effects on water molecules. Sulfuric acid is something of a double agent before it is neutralized, because while it reacts with H2O, it also sticks to it, making less water available for living things. Ammonium bisulfate, which is also less acidic, doesn’t stick nearly as well, freeing up that water for other types of chemical reactions.

So much for the clouds of Venus being supposedly too dry and acidic to support anything that would need water to stay alive.

Even more amazing is that photosynthesis could even be possible at night on Venus. It already happens in environments with hardly any light on Earth, such as hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean. The photon fluxes on Venus were found to be much higher than those on Earth. Meaning, heat and light do not scatter and vanish as quickly in the gases of the Venusian atmosphere as they do in water. Light energy in thermal or infrared forms, possibly both, rises from the surface and is retained in the clouds. Phototrophs would never want for photons.

“Venus’ surface is just so hot that a major amount of thermal radiation is given off, this makes the atmosphere hot,” Mogul says. “Together, the surface and atmosphere release photons of light due to the heat, which then rise into the clouds.”

Whether there are alien things swarming in the clouds of Venus is still unknown, but if something like that is ever discovered, the find shouldn’t be completely unexpected.",,[]
phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,The Best Tranexamic Acid Products For Hyperpigmentation,"If you struggle at all with hyperpigmentation, chances are you’ve tried products with vitamin C or hydroquinone to reduce discoloration. Not knocking the efficacy of those ingredients here but there’s another player in the skincare game that might also hold the key to a more even complexion: tranexamic acid (or TXA for short). The ingredient is great at targeting hyperigmentation whether it be post-inflammatory or from melasma. The best part: It's very gentle and plays nicely with other ingredients—including actives that can be temperamental to mix with.



What is tranexamic acid?

“Tranexamic acid is an acid derived from a synthetic form of lysine,” says Dr. Farhaad Riyaz, a board-certified dermatologist and medical advisor for Docent, a prescription skincare brand. “In the skincare arena, it is used topically to treat hyperpigmentation, PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), and melasma (hormonally-induced hyperpigmentation).”

What does tranexamic acid do?

According to Dr. Riyaz, tranexamic acid attacks melanin production by inhibiting tyrosinase, the enzyme that’s responsible for pigmentation. “It does not exfoliate or stimulate collagen, so it is typically combined with other medications,” he adds. Specifically, tranexamic acid's mild enough to be used in conjunction with other brighteners like niacinamide and kojic acid as well as typically well-tolerated when combined with tretinoin and other active ingredients you may be using to target the signs of aging like fine lines and wrinkles.

How do you use tranexamic acid?

If you’re ready to give this new gentle but efficacious ingredient a try, Dr. Riyaz recommends looking for a serum, moisturizer, or peel with tranexamic acid in it. “The ideal concentration of tranexamic acid ranges from 3 to 5 percent, which is the amount proven to be effective in clinical studies,” he says. Typically, you can apply, say, a serum with tranexamic acid in it daily, morning or night, and even up to twice a day, but you should always start slow and patch test new products on your skin in an inconspicuous area first. According to Dr. Riyaz, tranexamic acid is suitable for all skin types and tones, and based on clinical trials, the only real side effects are dryness, irritation, and potentially a little flaking with use.

Can you use tranexamic acid if you're pregnant or breastfeeding?

For best results, keep these other tranexamic acid pointers in mind. “As with other ingredients and treatments for hyperpigmentation, daily use of a sunscreen with an SPF of 30+ is a must to help control hyperpigmentation,” says Dr. Riyaz. Also, because topical tranexamic acid hasn’t been studied in pregnant or breastfeeding women, you should always consult your dermatologist and obstetrician before beginning use in those cases. tranexamic acid can also be a great alternative for those sensitive to hydroquinone or anyone who wants to take a break from it for whatever reason. Just don’t expect an overnight change with tranexamic acid, and consistency is key. “Most people will notice results with consistent use in eight to 12 weeks,” says Riyaz.

Looking to add a few tranexamic acid-forward products to your beauty toolkit? Consider these five options, depending on your skincare needs and product preferences.",,"['Danielle Blundell', 'Danielle Blundell Is A New York City-Based Lifestyle Writer', 'Editor Who Has Written On Topics Ranging Home To Health For A Variety Of Publications Including Rachael Ray Every Day', 'Redbook', 'Family Circle', 'This Old House', 'Elle Decor', 'Esquire', 'Domino', 'Apartment Therapy.']"
phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,Marine bioactive compounds against SARS-CoV-2,"In the current era, viruses pose a significant threat to humans since they are capable of causing pandemics throughout the world. Changing environments, globalization, urbanization, population growth, and changes in transport and infrastructure have created new opportunities for viral infections to start and spread.

Review: Multifaceted role of natural sources for COVID-19 pandemic as marine drugs. ​​​​​​​Image Credit: Charlotte Bleijenberg / Shutterstock

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2019 in Wuhan, China, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus binds to the host ACE2 receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The RBD interacts with a lysine residue on the ACE2 receptor which makes it a potential pharmaceutical target. Infection with this virus results in end-stage respiratory illness, systemic involvement, and even death. Though several COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, they cannot be relied upon entirely, so additional treatments are needed.

Natural products are still considered one of the most common sources of antibacterial and antiviral medication. For several decades marine plants and microorganisms have been used in scientific inquiry. Marine creatures have developed various anti-infective techniques and chemicals to defend themselves against viruses and microorganisms that reside in the ocean. There are several advantages to utilizing these marine resources due to their ecological safety, physiological compatibility, and low toxin levels.

Antiviral properties of several natural substances derived from marine resources are currently being studied against COVID-19. Some of the compounds show similar efficacy, while few are more potent than the approved drugs. One such example is Phycocyanobilins (PCBs) and sulfated polysaccharides that bind and inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with higher affinity as compared to the traditional drug remdesivir. Natural inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) that is derived from marine microorganisms and sponges has been reported to protect against severe COVID-19. Additionally, various marine metabolites that are derived from scleractinian-related animals, algae, and sponges have been found to interact with a major SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro. Mpro is an enzyme that plays an important role in viral replication and transcription. Marine-derived compounds can also target SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (S), nucleocapsid proteins (N), matrix glycoproteins (M), tiny envelope proteins (E) as well as 3CLpro, which is also involved in replication, transcription, and maturation of the virus.

A new review paper published in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research aimed to determine the possibilities of using biologically active compounds derived from various chemical classes of marine organisms against SARS-CoV-2 infection at various stages of the life cycle of the virus.

COVID-19 viral pathogenesis

Coronaviruses have two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. Coronavirinae subfamily comprises four genera, alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus whose genome is enveloped and connected to a nucleoprotein (N). The membrane (M) and envelope protein (E) help in virus assembly, while the spike protein (S) helps in the entry of the virus inside the host cell. Non-structural proteins that help in the viral lifecycle are 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, and papain-like protease (PLpro).

Immune response and symptoms of COVID-19

SARS-CoV-2 can attack the respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, kidney, liver, heart, and central nervous system and cause multiple organ failures. The initial immunological response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection is the release of cytokines and immune-cell infiltration that results in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 in most patients. However, in the case of serious disease, a downregulation of immune response has been observed.

COVID-19 symptoms can range from moderate to severe, with headache, nasal congestion, loss of taste and smell, fever, sore throat, breathing difficulties, muscle pain, and diarrhea being the most common symptoms.

Coronavirus lifecycle and targets for the development of antiviral agents

The SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle begins with the interaction of the spike protein RBD with the ACE2 receptor that is expressed on the endothelial surface in the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Thereafter, the virus enters inside the host cell through the fusion of the viral and host cell membrane along with endocytosis with the help of the spike protein’s S2 subunit.

The cellular protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the spike protein once the spike protein-ACE2 complex is formed leading to the fusion with the host membrane and release of the viral genome. Other proteases such as plasmin, trypsin, and factor Xa are also involved in the process. Endocytosis is brought about by endolysosomes furin and cathepsin B/L (CatB/L). Therefore, therapies that can prevent one or more events in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2 are now being developed with the important targets being receptor binding and membrane fusion.

Inhibitors of unspecific attachment of the virus to the factors on the host cell surface

Unspecific attachment can help to raise the viral particle concentrations in the environment, thereby leading to higher infection rates. The attachment and penetration inhibitors can bind to virus receptor molecules on the surface of susceptible cells, to an intermediate, “activated” version of viral protein, and to specific proteins directly in the virion to prevent any further structural changes. These inhibitors can be used in antiviral drugs. A few of the common inhibitors are lectins and glycosaminoglycan mimetics.

Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that can recognize and reversibly bind to complex glycoconjugates moieties without affecting any covalent structures. Species that include lectins are algae, marine corals, fungi, prokaryotes, higher plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates. Mannose-binding lectins are quite important in antiviral research since they can prevent virus self-assembly during replication.

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long sulfated polysaccharides whose expression occurs on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix. SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses use GAGs for the attachment to host cells. Cell surface glycoproteins can interact with GAG to mimic heparinoid polysaccharides leading to the formation of a protective barrier that prevents viral binding.

Inhibitors of viral lipid‑dependent attachment to host cells

Lipids are important in the life cycle of viruses since they can act as direct receptors or cofactors for entry of virus entrance on the cell surface and in endosomes. In addition, certain viruses also utilize lipid rafts for some stages of their reproductive cycle.

Lipids can be altered by sterols that can be used to restrict viral replication. Other compounds such as sphingolipids and cyclodextrin can also inhibit the infectivity of several viruses, including coronaviruses. Sterols can be found in many organisms such as Arthropoda, porifera, algae, echinodermata, tunicata, mollusks, coelenterata, bryozoa, and chordates.

Inhibitors of specific receptors and fusion of cytoplasmic and viral membranes

Compounds that interact with the spike protein and proteases can prevent the entry of the virus inside the cell and subsequent infection. Therefore, they can be used as antiviral agents. This includes ACE2 inhibitors, TMPRSS2 inhibitors as well as biologically active substances such as flavonoids, terpenes, and peptides.

Virion deproteinization

Deproteinization of the virus takes place by surface-bound proteases like TMPRSS2 and cysteine proteases in endosomes as well as other proteases such as 3CLpro, PL2pro, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and helicase. Inhibiting these proteases can interfere with the life cycle of the virus and prevent infection.

Phlorotannins, lipids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and flavonoids are reported to be important compounds that can serve as inhibitors of the major SARS-CoV-2 proteases.

Marine bioactive compounds that can act against SARS‑CoV‑2

Major marine compounds that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection are derived from Scleractinia, an order of Anthozoa which is only found in the marine environment. Approximately 15 chemicals have been derived from Scleractinia-associated organisms that have the potential to inhibit viral infection.

Other compounds such as phycocyanin, polysaccharides, lutein, vitamin E, and B12, are also derived from marine algae. One polysaccharide, lambda carrageenan which is isolated from marine red algae, has antibacterial, antiviral, anti-coagulant, and anti-cancerous properties. Both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus have been reported to be inhibited by it.

Furthermore, two Scleractinia-related metabolites have been found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, while three were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Marine compounds derived from the Aplysinidae family, Petrosia stronglyophora sp., as well as the soft coral Pterogorgia citrina can also act as inhibitors of Mpro. Other marine compounds such as PCBs and polysaccharides such as carrageenan, fucoidan, and alginate have also been identified to play a significant role in virus protection.

Clinical studies on iota-carrageenan–containing lozenges and iota-carrageenan nasal spray have revealed antiviral efficacy against influenza A, human coronaviruses, and human rhinovirus. Carrageenan-treated coronavirus-infected individuals were observed to have a shorter duration of illness and fewer relapses as compared to untreated individuals. Nucleoside inhibitors mycalisine A and B derived from marine sponge Mycale sp were also found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RdRp with greater efficacy as compared to traditional drugs such as remdesivir.

Benefits of marine sulfated polysaccharides (SPs) over other natural compounds

Marine algae thus have been identified as an excellent source of a wide range of bioactive chemicals that have antiviral, anti-coagulant, immunomodulating, cancer-fighting, and antioxidant capabilities. Recent research has highlighted the potential of marine macroalgal blooms as a never-ending source of biologically active chemicals that will lead to new therapies.

These compounds are biocompatible, safe, and biodegradable. Additionally, algae-based SPs have lower manufacturing costs as compared to plant-derived natural chemicals. Also, marine SPs being water-soluble, can be extracted using an aqueous extraction technique, making them useful in pharmaceutical businesses as their characteristics can be readily changed. Furthermore, SPs have not been linked to any known health risks in pharmaceuticals, although further research is required on their chemical characteristics, bioavailability, toxicity, and biological processes.

Conclusion

According to the current review, several marine chemicals might be quite effective against SARS-CoV-2. Certain marine compounds can be a better choice as compared to chemically manufactured medicines for the treatment of severe COVID-19. Marine resources are also cost-effective due to their large quantity and variety. The advancements in bioinformatics techniques, investigations on gene mutations, and multi-omics technologies can provide a potential solution to the current limitations regarding marine drug development. Further research on novel resources derived from the sea might produce promising therapeutics for COVID-19 patients.

Limitations

Marine drug development faces certain obstacles. A major concern is that, despite the fact that the sea is home to many species, they are not easily accessible. A steady supply of chemicals is required to continue preclinical and clinical studies and further development of the drugs.",,[]

phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,Spirulina benefits: Effects of spirulina on sport performances,"Spirulina is type of blue-green algae rich in nutrients and antioxidants and it is also one of the most popular nutritional supplements in the world. As a result, spirulina is associated with a number of positive health effects, most notably effects which apply to the area of sport performances.

Here, we take a closer look at how spirulina affects sporting performances.

First of all, spirulina is 55-70 percent protein, which is a percentage significantly larger than those of beef (25 percent protein) and eggs (13 percent). Therefore, this makes spirulina a key source of long-lasting energy for athletes, whilst assisting them with muscle growth and improving stamina.

Given that it is algae, it is also far easier than the likes of lentils, beef and cow's milk to digest, as there is no extra cell membrane to break down. Whilst the net protein use of spirulina is around 52 percent, those of lentils, beef and cow's milk are 30 percent, 15 percent and 12 percent respectively.

Furthermore, spirulina contains a pigment called phycocyanin which gives it its unique blue-green colour. It is a key antioxidant which assists athletes with anti-inflammation. This can be a significant aid to athletes given the amount of physical stress which they endure on a regular basis.

What other health benefits does spirulina bring?

Aside from a strictly sporting perspective, there is evidence that spirulina may have anti-cancer properties and that it may reduce blood pressure.

For example, in a recent study in India involving 87 people with precancerous lesions, among those who took one gram of spirulina per day for one year 45 percent of these people saw the lesions disappear.

With regards to a reduction in blood pressure, a dose of 4.5 grams per day has been proven to reduce the blood pressure of individuals with normal levels.",,[]
phycocyanin,phycocyanin use,Why This Blue Beer Has Major Health Benefits,"Unlike the green beer swilled by the masses on St. Patrick's Day, which uses green food dye, Line's bluish tint is caused by the pigment phycocyanin found in the blue-green algae known as spirulina, according to Food & Wine. Like its green counterpart, the blue color doesn't impact the beer's flavor in any discernible way. It is made in the style of a session IPA, producing notes of citrus and a slight hoppiness.

Since it contains spirulina, the beer provides a number of potential health benefits, and clocking in at a modest 3% ABV (Alcohol by Volume), you're unlikely to get inebriated if you indulge in one or two. This particular type of algae, which is available in dietary supplements, is packed with protein and rich in vitamins, according to Medical News Today. A series of studies published through the National Library of Medicine have indicated that spirulina also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help strengthen the immune system.

Blue-green algae is often labeled a superfood as well, although this is not a medical or scientific term and can sometimes be associated with product marketing hype. Regardless, spirulina is nutrient-dense and low in calories, so ""To your health"" just might prove a fitting toast for those raising a glass of this quirky blue beer.",,['Colin Mccandless']

ROUBAIX, France – A French brewer has started using algae with a naturally-occurring pigment to turn their beer blue.

The beer, with the brand name “Line”, is the result of a tie-up between a firm that wants to popularise the algae as a dietary supplement, and a nearby craft brewery that was looking for a way to make its beverages more distinctive.

The beer is selling well, said Sebastien Verbeke, an employee of Hoppy Urban Brew, which makes the drink. “It’s getting an enormous amount of interest and curiosity on the part of the public,” he said.

The blue tint comes from spirulina, an algae that is grown in basins by a company called Etika Spirulina in northern France. The component of the spirulina that gives the blue colour, called phycocyanin, is then added to the beer during the brewing process.

Tasting a freshly produced bottle of the beer, brewery employee Mathilde Vanmansart described it as hoppy, light, and with fruity notes, while the only evidence of the added algae was the distinctive colour.

Xavier Delannoy, whose farm provides the spirulina, said after several test batches, the brewery had found a blend that appealed to customers.

He said 1,500 bottles of the blue beer were sold between October and December last year, and the brewery is now preparing to ramp up production to meet demand.",,[]

Review: Multifaceted role of natural sources for COVID-19 pandemic as marine drugs. ​​​​​​​Image Credit: Charlotte Bleijenberg / Shutterstock

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2019 in Wuhan, China, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus binds to the host ACE2 receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The RBD interacts with a lysine residue on the ACE2 receptor which makes it a potential pharmaceutical target. Infection with this virus results in end-stage respiratory illness, systemic involvement, and even death. Though several COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, they cannot be relied upon entirely, so additional treatments are needed.

Natural products are still considered one of the most common sources of antibacterial and antiviral medication. For several decades marine plants and microorganisms have been used in scientific inquiry. Marine creatures have developed various anti-infective techniques and chemicals to defend themselves against viruses and microorganisms that reside in the ocean. There are several advantages to utilizing these marine resources due to their ecological safety, physiological compatibility, and low toxin levels.

Antiviral properties of several natural substances derived from marine resources are currently being studied against COVID-19. Some of the compounds show similar efficacy, while few are more potent than the approved drugs. One such example is Phycocyanobilins (PCBs) and sulfated polysaccharides that bind and inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with higher affinity as compared to the traditional drug remdesivir. Natural inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) that is derived from marine microorganisms and sponges has been reported to protect against severe COVID-19. Additionally, various marine metabolites that are derived from scleractinian-related animals, algae, and sponges have been found to interact with a major SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro. Mpro is an enzyme that plays an important role in viral replication and transcription. Marine-derived compounds can also target SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (S), nucleocapsid proteins (N), matrix glycoproteins (M), tiny envelope proteins (E) as well as 3CLpro, which is also involved in replication, transcription, and maturation of the virus.

A new review paper published in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research aimed to determine the possibilities of using biologically active compounds derived from various chemical classes of marine organisms against SARS-CoV-2 infection at various stages of the life cycle of the virus.

COVID-19 viral pathogenesis

Coronaviruses have two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. Coronavirinae subfamily comprises four genera, alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus whose genome is enveloped and connected to a nucleoprotein (N). The membrane (M) and envelope protein (E) help in virus assembly, while the spike protein (S) helps in the entry of the virus inside the host cell. Non-structural proteins that help in the viral lifecycle are 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, and papain-like protease (PLpro).

Immune response and symptoms of COVID-19

SARS-CoV-2 can attack the respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, kidney, liver, heart, and central nervous system and cause multiple organ failures. The initial immunological response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection is the release of cytokines and immune-cell infiltration that results in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 in most patients. However, in the case of serious disease, a downregulation of immune response has been observed.

COVID-19 symptoms can range from moderate to severe, with headache, nasal congestion, loss of taste and smell, fever, sore throat, breathing difficulties, muscle pain, and diarrhea being the most common symptoms.

Coronavirus lifecycle and targets for the development of antiviral agents

The SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle begins with the interaction of the spike protein RBD with the ACE2 receptor that is expressed on the endothelial surface in the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Thereafter, the virus enters inside the host cell through the fusion of the viral and host cell membrane along with endocytosis with the help of the spike protein’s S2 subunit.

The cellular protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the spike protein once the spike protein-ACE2 complex is formed leading to the fusion with the host membrane and release of the viral genome. Other proteases such as plasmin, trypsin, and factor Xa are also involved in the process. Endocytosis is brought about by endolysosomes furin and cathepsin B/L (CatB/L). Therefore, therapies that can prevent one or more events in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2 are now being developed with the important targets being receptor binding and membrane fusion.

Inhibitors of unspecific attachment of the virus to the factors on the host cell surface

Unspecific attachment can help to raise the viral particle concentrations in the environment, thereby leading to higher infection rates. The attachment and penetration inhibitors can bind to virus receptor molecules on the surface of susceptible cells, to an intermediate, “activated” version of viral protein, and to specific proteins directly in the virion to prevent any further structural changes.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin good,Influence of Pholiota adiposa on gut microbiota and promote tumor cell apoptosis properties in H22 tumor-bearing mice,"The results of LC–MS analysis

As shown in Fig. 1, in the present study, under optimal chromatographic and MS conditions14,15, 3 compounds were identified by comparing the retention times and matching the empirical molecular formulas with those of known saponins; six phenolic compounds, seven fatty acid compounds, three nucleotide compounds, five quinone compounds, six carbohydrate compounds, and four steroid compounds were identified, and sterol compounds, such as ergosterol peroxide, ergosta-4, 6, 8(14)22-tetraen-3-one, ergosterol, and (22E,24R)-ergosta-7, 22-dien-3β,5α,6β-triol, accounted for a high proportion (Table 1).

Analyses of tumor weight, tumor inhibitory rate, and organ index

The tumor volume growth curves are shown in Fig. 2. The tumor growth rate in the model group was more than 2.6 cm3 on Day 15. In contrast, CTX-treated and all EPA-treated groups showed obvious inhibition of tumor growth.

Figure 2 The effects of EPA on tumor H22 tumor-bearing mice. Full size image

The organ index, tumor weight, and tumor inhibitory rate (TIR) are shown in Table 2. The CTX-treated group exhibited the highest TIR (92.42%). Moreover, the tumor weight in the EPA-treated groups significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, with tumor inhibitory rates of 79.70%, 84.55%, and 87.28%. The spleen and thymus indices were significantly lower in the CTX-treated group than in the normal group, and the thymus was severely atrophic (p < 0.05). The EPA-treated groups showed significant improvements, and there was a protective effect on the spleen and thymus.

Analysis of the expression of serum cytokines and VEGF in mice

ELISA was used to investigate the effects of EPA on serum cytokine production, including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, AST, BUN, and IL-6, in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Angiogenesis has become an important therapeutic target for many tumors and is an essential process for tumor growth and metastasis10,16.

As shown in Fig. 3, compared with the levels in the normal and model groups, the serum levels of IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α significantly increased in the EPA-treated HD group (p < 0.05). VEGF levels were significantly decreased in the CTX-treated and EPA-treated groups. The AST and BUN levels in the model group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group (p < 0.05). The values of these two parameters significantly decreased in the EPA-treated groups compared to those in the model control group (p < 0.05). The AST levels of mice in the CTX-treated group were significantly higher than those of the model group (p < 0.05).

Morphological analysis after treatment with EPA

Histopathology was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the tumor. As shown in Fig. 4A, tumor cell in the model group s were plump and intact, with large nuclei. After treatment with EPA and CTX, the tumor cells exhibited a large necrotic region and were stained darker, which indicates that the significant antitumor efficacy of EPA in H22 tumor-bearing mice involved inducing cell death.

Figure 4 Histological examination of the morphological changes in tumors from H22-bearing mice. Tumor tissues stained with H&E (A) (400 ×) TUNEL assay (400 ×) (B,C). Full size image

The TUNEL assay results are shown in Fig. 4B,C, and cells with brown granules were considered positively stained10,17. The percentage of positive cells in the model group was 5%; therefore, the amount of tumor cell apoptosis was minimal. However, the CTX-treated group exhibited the highest percentage of positive cells (44%). The EPA-treated groups showed an increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, with values of 12%, 28%, and 42%. Moreover, the mice in the HD and EPA-treated group showed a positive cell percentage similar to that of the CTX-treated group.

Effects of EPA on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and VEGF

Based on the results of previous studies18, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the proapoptotic factor BAX, the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase 3 to determine the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, as shown in Fig. 5. BAX and cleaved caspase 3 expression intensities increased, while Bcl-2 expression decreased in the EPA-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the ratio of Bcl-2 to BAX decreased significantly. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level in the EPA-treated groups significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and VEGF expression was lowest in the CTX-treated group.

Figure 5 Immunohistochemical anylisis of tumor tissues and stained area of tumor tissues. Full size image

In addition, western blotting was used to analyze the expression of Bcl-2, BAX, cleaved caspase 3, and VEGF. As shown in Fig. 6, all EPA-treated groups showed increased BAX and cleaved caspase 3 protein expression and decreased Bcl-2 and VEGF protein expression; these results were consistent with the results of the immunohistochemical analysis. However, the expression of PI3K/AKT and p-AKT/AKT increased in a dose-dependent manner in the EPA-treated group.

Results of the rank-abundance curves of microorganisms in samples

The rank-abundance curve is a method used to analyze the diversity of microorganisms. In this study, the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) rank-abundance curves showed the diversity in the samples, which can be explained by species richness and evenness19. In the horizontal direction, the wider the span of the curve is, the richer the species rank of the microorganism sample20. The OTU rank-abundance curve in this study showed that the abundance distribution of the samples was even, as it was flat and smooth in the vertical direction (Fig. 7). The richness and evenness of the samples shown in the rank-abundance curve indicate that the diversity of the samples was rational and reasonable.

Dilution curves of microorganisms in the gut microbiota

The dilution curve was used to evaluate whether the sample sequencing depth was sufficient to cover all species of microbes and compare species richness among different sequenced samples. A flat curve indicates that the sequencing data are reasonable and reflect the structure of the entire community21. The number of sequences reached 5000, and the curves were in the plateau stage (Fig. 8). Therefore, the experimental data were deemed reasonable and reliable.

Species accumulation curves of the gut microbiota

The species accumulation curve is used to describe the increase in species with the increase in the number of samples and is an effective tool for investigating the composition and predicting the abundance of species in samples. This curve reflects whether the number of samples was sufficient. In this study, we mainly observed the end of the curve; if it showed a sharp upward trend, the number of samples was considered insufficient, while if the end of the curve tended to be flat, the number of samples was considered sufficient22. The end of the species accumulation curves of Specaccums tended to be flat in this study; therefore, the sampling was considered sufficient to carry out data analysis (Fig. 9).

Results of alpha diversity analysis of the gut microbiota

In this study, six indicators, including the Chao1 index, observed species index, PD_whole_tree index, goods-coverage index, Shannon index, and Simpson's index, were analyzed to assess the species diversity of individual samples (Fig. 10). There was no significant difference in flora abundance or diversity between the normal, model, and HD groups in the EPA-treated group.

Results of beta diversity analysis of the gut microbiota

Beta diversity analysis was used to compare the differences in species diversity among intergroup samples, and the evolutionary distance between species was considered while calculating the results. The higher the index value, the greater the difference between the samples. In this study, the UniFrac results were divided into two parts: the weighted UniFrac, which considered the abundance of the sequence, and the unweighted UniFrac, which did not consider the abundance of the sequence. According to the statistical analysis of the differences of the clustered samples, the similarity of species composition among the samples was determined by calculating the distance between the samples23.

ANOSIM similarity analysis was used to determine the intergroup and intragroup differences, and the grouping was found to be meaningful (Fig. 11). The R value of the unweighted results was R = 0.34 > 0 and p = 0.001 < 0.05, indicating that the differences between the groups were significantly greater than those within the group (intragroup). Therefore, the result is reasonable, and the data are statistically significant. Thus, in this study, the gut microbiota in tumor-bearing mice tended to be normal after EPA treatment.

Figure 11 Anosim analysis of gut microbiota based on unweighted unifrac distance. Full size image

Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was used to evaluate the differences between samples (Fig. 12)24. If the samples were in close proximity, the species compositions of the samples were similar. The EPA-treated group was closer in distance to the normal group, indicating that both groups had similar gut microbiotas.

Difference Analysis of the Gut Microbiota

To emphasize the statistical significance and biological relevance, the LEFse analysis of the gut microflora was performed, and the results are presented quantitatively in an LDA Score column and a cladogram. This study aimed to estimate the impact of the abundance of each component and identify the significant difference effect on the division of samples23. The results showed significant differences in the gut microflora, such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Streptococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Alistipes (Nor), Campylobacterales, Epsilonproteobacteria, Helicobacteraceae, Helicobacter, Escherichia_Shigella, Subdoligranulum (Mod), Prevotellaceae, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidaceae, Bacteroides, and Selenomonadales (EPA) (Figs. 13 and 14).

Species abundance in the gut microbiota

Histograms showing species profiling in the gut microflora of each sample were used to identify the species with higher relative abundances and individual samples at different classification levels (Fig. 15A and Table 3)25. In this study, the phylum level showed that Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Proteobacteria accounted for more than 98% of the total microflora after the different treatments. Compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes decreased, but Proteobacteria increased in the model group. In contrast, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes increased, but Proteobacteria decreased in the EPA-treated group and was close to that in the normal group. Thus, the trend in the two phyla in the microflora in the EPA-treated group trended more toward that in the normal group.

Figure 15B shows the genus level of the gut microflora in the three groups. Based on abundance, the main groups were Lactobacillus, Bacteroidales_S24 − 7_group_norank, Bacteroidales, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 001, Alloprevotella, Streptococcus, Alistipes, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 003, and Helicobacter. Based on the changing trend in the abundance of the gut microflora, it can be concluded that tumor-bearing mice that were treated with EPA tended to be closer to those in the normal control group. Compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of beneficial microflora such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroidales_S24 − 7_group_norank, Bacteroidales, Alloprevotella and Alistipes in the model group decreased by 6.95%, 25.25%, 4.67%, 2.65%, and 0.68%, respectively; accordingly, compared with those in the model group, those in the EPA group increased by 10.67%, 19.94%, 1.34%, and 3.29%, respectively, which showed a significant reversion in the reduction in beneficial microflora in the model group. In contrast, compared with that in the normal group, the abundance of the harmful microflora Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG − 001, Helicobacter, and Prevotellaceae_UCG − 003 in the model group increased to 16.39%, 7.01%, 5.83%, and 8.81%, respectively, while those in the EPA-treated group decreased to 17.99%, 1.44%, 5.81%, and 3.33%, respectively. These results showed that EPA treatment balanced the relative abundance of beneficial and detrimental bacteria in the gut microflora, as observed in the normal group.",,"['Wang', 'Academy Of Traditional Chinese Medicine', 'Jilin Agricultural Science', 'Technology University', 'Jilin', 'Academy Of Medical', 'Changchun Sci-Tech University', 'Changchun', 'Zhang', 'Liu']"

Phycocyanin pigments are vital for multiple industries, having various important commercial applications. Producing them from gas and oil wastewater presents a sustainable waste valorization process that fits the aims of the circular economy concept.

Phycocyanin

Phycocyanin, along with allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin, is a pigment-protein complex. It is a water-soluble light-harvesting phycobiliprotein with a characteristic light blue color and is an accessory pigment to chlorophyll. Phycocyanins are produced by cyanobacteria.

There are numerous commercial and scientific uses of phycocyanin. It is used as a natural food coloring, in nutritional supplements (for example, spirulina,) as a coloring in cosmetics, and as fluorescent markers in immunological assays. It is also used in animal feeds and aquaculture. Additionally, it contains anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and antiviral properties, making it an attractive target for therapeutics and drugs within the biomedical industry.

Using Petrochemical Wastewater for Microalgae Culture

The petrochemical industries produce large volumes of wastewater globally as a result of oil and gas extraction. Over 90% is re-injected into formations or disposal wells for recovery. Treatment ponds are used to store most of the remaining wastewater. If disposed of untreated into the environment, wastewater can cause significant levels of pollution, affecting vulnerable ecosystems.

Using produced wastewater for the cultivation of algae is a huge opportunity for the valorization of waste streams in the oil and gas industries. This can be used for nutrient recovery, with the biomass used for beneficial purposes. A 2017 study has found that whilst produced wastewater has high salinity and organic compounds that are detrimental for algae growth, important inorganic nutrients which microbes use for growth are present, which is advantageous. Produced wastewater can therefore be used as a culture medium.

Additionally, there are indications that using produced wastewater for microalgal cultivation can be used for biofuel production as well as microbial wastewater treatment. Another recent study has demonstrated the possibility of utilizing microalgal cultivation for nutrient removal.

The majority of current investigations into using produced wastewater as a microalgae cultivation medium have focused on using microalgal biofilms for biofuel production. Conversely, there is limited research into the production of valuable bioproducts. Integrating side streams of valuable bioproducts into processes using microalgal biorefineries could help reduce the costs associated with microalgal wastewater treatment and biofuel production.

The recovery of phycobiliproteins such as phycocyanin and their derivative products can be easily integrated into microalgae biorefinery operations, and the water solubility of phycobiliproteins means that they do not interfere with the recovery of denser liquids. Thus, integrating them into these operations can optimize operations and add value to them.

Suitable substrates for microalgae biofilm growth have been identified in the current literature, with over 15 different materials so far explored. Cotton-based materials have been identified as the best-performing options.

The Study

The main purpose of the new study published online in Frontiers in Energy Research is to evaluate the influence of growth materials and light intensity in a rotating algae biofilm reactor on phycocyanin production. LLC2, a strain of cyanobacteria, was chosen for its ability to form biofilms in different light and substrate conditions. High levels of turbidity and good solid biomass production were identified as key factors in the choice of the reactor for the study.

The team constructed a 2000-liter outdoor-produced water pond at Utah State University. The pool was operated between August and September due to favorable outdoor temperature and the pond was shaded to control light intensity. Out of the materials tested for biofilm growth substratum, the cotton rope was identified as the best option.

Amongst the experimental observations in the study, low light LLC2 biofilms produced twice the amount of phycocyanin per biomass yield compared to high light biofilms. An accompanying crude extract purity (just above the benchmark standard for food-grade phycocyanin) was observed. The authors concluded that different production goals could be achieved by adjusting the light level for biofilm culture.

Based on their experimental observations, the authors have stated that future studies should concentrate on producing other high-value products from microalgae cultures in produced wastewater. Additionally, amongst other future research directions suggested in the study, the potential value of cyanobacteria biofilms to produce valuable bioproducts such as fertilizer, feed, biofuels, and biogas should be assessed in studies.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin good,"Spirulina: Uses, Benefits, Side Effects, Dosage, Precautions","Spirulina is a blue-green algae from the genus Arthrospira (""arthro"" roughly meaning ""joint,"" and ""spira"" meaning ""spiral""). It's been used by the Aztecs in Mexico and people living in the Lake Chad area in Africa for centuries. Spirulina's usually cultivated from bodies of water like lakes or farmed in ponds.

Spirulina contains several nutrients, including fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, and K), fatty acids (DHA, EPA), beta carotene and minerals. It's also a source of protein, but it lacks high enough levels of some of the amino acids that your body needs to function at its best (unless you have a medical condition where you need to avoid specific amino acids, like phenylketonuria or ""PKU""). Since spirulina comes from bacteria (specifically ""cyanobacteria""), it may be considered a protein source for vegans.

It's also important to note that the B12 in spirulina is in a different form as ""pseudovitamin B12"" than the type typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs, especially if you follow a vegetarian or vegan way of eating, which can be low in B12. Lower levels of B12 are also found in adults over the age of 60. And why's B12 important? Because your body needs B12 to make red blood cells, it's also crucial for brain and nerve cell development. Not getting enough B12 can cause tiredness, memory loss, depression, and even different types of anemia.

This article takes a closer look at the potential uses of spirulina and the risks associated with its use.

Dietary supplements are not regulated in the United States, meaning the FDA does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement that has been tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn’t mean that they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about any potential interactions with other supplements or medications.

Uses of Spirulina

Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare provider, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD/RDN), or pharmacist. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease.



Spirulina has fat-soluble vitamins (like A, E, and K), beta carotene and minerals, protein, and phycocyanins (pigments that produce a blue color and have shown antioxidant effects). Phycocyanins have been used as a dye in many industries, including pharmacy, culinary, and even cosmetics.

Scientists have studied, but not necessarily proven, spirulina's impact on different areas of health, including but not limited to:

We'll explore what the science says about spirulina's effectiveness for these health outcomes.



Antioxidant capacity

According to a meta-analysis (a collection of research studies) of nine studies with a total of 415 people, spirulina increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The studies used anywhere from one to eight grams of spirulina per day, a pretty extensive range. Many of the studies had a relatively small number of people, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much. The strength of the effects was not earth-shattering and was generally more substantial when people took five grams of spirulina per day or more.

The conclusion? Getting antioxidants from the foods that we eat can help reduce some of the inflammation in our bodies. To amp up antioxidants in your diet, try including a variety of the most nutrient-dense foods that you can source and afford - and they don't have to be organic - like whole grains, fruit, and vegetables to help increase your body's antioxidant capacity and reduce inflammation in your body. Just don't rely on spirulina alone.

Blood pressure

Scientists did a meta-analysis (a collection of several research studies on a topic) of five randomized controlled trials that included 230 people to check spirulina's effects on blood pressure. The people in the different studies took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina a day. The lengths of the studies were anywhere from two to 12 weeks, and many of the studies were pretty small, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much.

When the data was pooled (put together) and analyzed from these studies, the scientists said that spirulina lowered systolic blood pressure by about 4.59 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure 7.02 millimeters of mercury. Systolic pressure (top number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. Diastolic pressure (bottom number) measures the pressure your arteries experience between each heartbeat. The biggest blood pressure-lowering in the studies was seen in people who had high blood pressure already.

The scientists also said more high-quality studies are needed before we can start recommending that everyone with high blood pressure needs to start eating spirulina.

Blood sugar control

Have you ever gotten a jittery feeling after eating sugary food? That usually means your blood sugar's spiking. And this situation can be dire for people coping with conditions like type I or type II diabetes, disordered eating including diabulimia, and more.

Over time, blood sugar spikes that are left uncontrolled can actually lead to damage to your body. Worst case, in certain conditions like diabetes, that can look like having to surgically remove parts of your body (amputation), heart attacks, kidney failure, or stroke, which can lead to paralysis of parts of your body. While spirulina really would not likely be able to correct severe damage from uncontrolled blood sugar over time by itself, it has lowered blood sugar levels in human studies. And why? It could be its protein and fiber content, or perhaps it is phycocyanin's ability to help with inflammation. Scientists are still figuring it out.

Fourteen studies with 510 people with metabolic syndrome–a collection of symptoms like high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (""good cholesterol""), and high waist circumference, which altogether can create more severe health problems–were included in a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on blood sugar and other outcomes. And a lot of those studies didn't have many people in them, meaning they had lower statistical power. People took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina per day. Blood sugar and insulin levels were reduced in some of the studies after taking specific amounts of spirulina. More high-quality studies are needed before healthcare providers can recommend spirulina for lowering blood sugar and insulin levels.

Generally, working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN), particularly a Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist (CDCES), can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. RDs/RDNs can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to avoid spikes in your blood sugar, which could help you feel better. Remember, managing blood sugar can be challenging, and you don't have to do it alone!

Cancer

Unfortunately, very few well-conducted human studies have looked at spirulina's effects on cancer. There've been several studies in test tube cells or in animals that aren't humans. However, more well-constructed studies looking at its effects on humans are needed.



Cholesterol levels

Scientists conducted a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on cholesterol levels that had seven controlled trials for a total of 522 total people. They found that spirulina reduced: total cholesterol (by 46.76 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)), low-density lipoprotein (LDL by 41.32 milligrams per deciliter), and triglycerides (by 44.23 milligrams per deciliter). It also increased the ""good"" cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL by 6.06 milligrams per deciliter). Again, why did spirulina do this? We're not sure, but scientists think it may be due to its nutritional profile (fiber, fatty acids like DHA and EPA), its antioxidant capacity, or a combination of these.



While healthcare providers cannot recommend spirulina for lowering your cholesterol, they can suggest working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) to help you explore your eating patterns, movement, and more. Registered dietitian nutritionists can help you build your toolkit and your capacity. Again, you're not alone!

Liver health

Spirulina has been studied for its effects on liver health in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the study was very small (only 13 people), so we can't draw any conclusions about spirulina for NAFLD until larger and better studies are done.

Metabolic syndrome

Scientists have studied spirulina's effects on metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome happens when you have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist (excess abdominal fat). Metabolic syndrome can wreak havoc with your health and increases your odds of heart attack, stroke, and type two diabetes. One of metabolic syndrome's main causes is thought to be obesity. Obesity, however, can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass.

One spirulina meta-analysis pulled together data from 18 studies. It suggested that spirulina could help lower high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, which are all parts of metabolic syndrome. It's important to note that while spirulina may impact these outcomes, the most essential issue would be working on your current way of eating, your movement (exercise), and other equally important issues like addressing your emotional health. Spirulina can't solve these serious issues.

Consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and perhaps one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. In addition, they can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to help you feel better. Sometimes it can be challenging to give yourself permission to ask for and accept help. But you've got this. And you don't have to go at it alone.

Obesity

In a meta-analysis of five studies, scientists looked at spirulina's effects on weight management in people coping with obesity. Spirulina did decrease weight in people with obesity by 4.55 pounds and in people who were overweight by 2.82 pounds. However, clinically speaking, this is not enough to make a solid recommendation for use of spirulina for obesity treatment.

As mentioned previously, it's important to note that obesity can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass. And BMI does not give the complete picture of an individual's well-being. Consider requesting a body composition test (for example, skin-fold measurements or a DEXA Body Composition scan) from your healthcare provider in addition to other parameters that they may measure.

As mentioned above, consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and, ideally, one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). CSOWM RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. They can help you build your toolkit and your capacity, and help you feel better. You've got this.



What Are the Side Effects of Spirulina?

An allergic reaction may be possible in those allergic to spirulina. Allergic reactions would include rash or swelling. Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience side effects and call your healthcare provider.



Common Side Effects

Spirulina is generally safe, but some people have reported the following with its use:

Allergy

Headache

Muscle pain

Sweating

Trouble sleeping



Severe Side Effects

While severe side effects from spirulina are rare, be aware that the following have occurred:

Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

(severe allergic reaction) Throat swelling

Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience severe side effects and call your healthcare provider.

Precautions

People with phenylketonuria (inability to process the amino acid phenylalanine) and individuals with other amino acid disorders, for example, classical homocystinuria (HCU), or maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), may need to avoid spirulina due to its high protein and thus amino acid content.



The safety of spirulina in pregnant or nursing people has not been established. Speak with your healthcare provider before using spirulina if you're pregnant, plan to get pregnant or if you're breastfeeding.

Please don't give children supplements–including spirulina–without discussing this with their pediatrician first.

Spirulina can sometimes be contaminated with things like lead or other heavy metals (it grows in lakes, after all) or even toxins.



Dosage: How Much Spirulina Should I Take?

Always speak with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement to ensure that the supplement and dosage are appropriate for your individual needs.



Manufacturer recommendations might vary. As a general guideline though, don't use more than what's listed on your product's label. There's no recommended ""effective"" dosage of spirulina. Avoid spirulina if you're allergic or sensitive to it or any of its ingredients. Studies have used from one to 10 grams a day for up to six months to 19 grams of spirulina a day for up two months, with a relatively good safety profile in people with different conditions.



Again, please do not give supplements to children without first discussing this with their pediatrician.

What Happens If I Take Too Much Spirulina?

An upper limit or recommended intake is lacking for spirulina. Taking upwards of 40 grams per day for an unknown period of time has been noted. If you believe that you've taken too much spirulina, contact your healthcare provider for information.



Interactions

Blood thinners: While there are only about 0.26 micrograms of vitamin K in each gram of spirulina, taking far larger amounts could theoretically impact the blood-thinning effects of some medicines like Jantoven (warfarin).

Immunomodulators: Little evidence exists to support avoiding the use of spirulina with immunosuppressive drugs or drugs that change the way that the immune system works (immunomodulators).

It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included. Please review this supplement label with your healthcare provider to discuss any potential interactions with foods, other supplements, and medications.



How to Store Spirulina

Store spirulina in a cool, dry place. Keep spirulina away from direct sunlight. Discard as indicated by the ""use by"" date on the packaging. Keep away from children and pets.



Similar Supplements

Chlorella (a green algae supplement) is somewhat similar to spirulina.

Frequently Asked Questions Is spirulina the same as chlorella? No, chlorella and spirulina are different species of algae, but they're both supplements.

What antioxidants does spirulina have? Spirulina has phycocyanins.

If I'm a vegan, can I get all my protein and B12 needs from spirulina? While spirulina has most of the amino acids that your body needs, it doesn't have enough of some of them. Try to eat a balanced, varied diet to meet your unique protein needs. The B12 in spirulina–pseudovitamin B12–is in a different form than the type that's typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs.

Sources of Spirulina & What to Look For

Blue-green algae species used in spirulina supplements are typically Spirulina maxima, Spirulina platensis, or Aphanizomenon flos-aquae.



Just because a remedy is thought to be ""natural"" does not mean that it is safe. Some ""wild-crafted"" spirulina products may have been grown in water contaminated with heavy metals (mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium) or other pollutants. Opt for supplements produced in labs and certified by third-party authorities like the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF International.



As with all supplements, it's essential to talk with your healthcare provider before using spirulina to decide if it's right for you.

Who fancies some blue food? Really?

The theory of food colour confusion may originate from us being strongly aroused by foods on the red spectrum. Research published in Nature recently showed that we are more attracted to red coloured foods as they appear to signal better nutrition with higher calories in comparison to blue or green foods. Trichromatic vision evolved in humans as a response to improve foraging and may explain why we rely more on sight than scent when locating the most nutritious foods and fruits that are ripe and ready to eat. This is surprising to us as ‘leafy green’ farmers when we readily assume a green colour relates to health but the Nature study was more assigned to calorific colour arousal. Although our brains may not easily accept the blue colour as natural, our bodies will probably thank us if we do as blue-green algae also known as cyanobacteria has some of the best health benefits. Superfoods: Yogurt with blue Spirulina, Scottish Damsens, Blueberries and Sloes.

One particular cyanobacteria has been studied extensively over the years

Spirulina grows naturally in alkaline waters and was recognised and farmed by ancient civilisations for its medicinal qualities. The Aztecs of Mexico have a long historical relationship with Spirulina. They farmed Spirulina in large lakes, then harvested and air dried the algae to form a hard edible ‘cake’. This was often mixed with other foods and used as an energy source as these ancient people recognised it as an important functional food.

Massive health benefits that many people have still to discover

People who move beyond the colour tend to use blue-green algae for supercharging the immune system, controlling muscle spasms, detoxing heavy metals, eliminating candida, improving memory and increasing energy levels to improve exercise performance. It may also lower cholesterol and blood sugar, acting to prevent heart disease, heal wounds and improve digestion. Pretty impressive qualities for this single celled life form billions of years old.

There are two main species of the blue green algae Spirulina, Arthrospira platensis and Arthrospira maxima. As the image demonstrates, they are made up of single cells containing chlorophyll filled vesicles that react to light and photosynthesize like plants. Cultivation of commercial algae usually starts the life cycle in lab culture tubes, doubling quickly under controlled conditions. This helps to eliminate contaminants. Spirulina is the largest single celled blue green algae and it forms spirals visible to the human eye which bunch together to allow a quick harvest and is now cultivated worldwide as a nutritional supplement.

Spirulina is high in iron, calcium, magnesium, copper, beta-carotene and B-vitamins.

Apart from the high content of protein, Spirulina contains B vitamins, particularly B12 and provitamin A (β-carotenes), and minerals, especially iron. It is also rich in phenolic acids, tocopherols and γ-linolenic acid. Spirulina does not have a cellulose cell wall so it is more easily digested. Most people selling dried Spirulina suggest 1-8g per day to boost the immune system but be careful as too much can have negative effects so it’s best to start with the lowest dose.

Some suggest Spirulina has the power to tackle world wide problems like malnutrition. The UN and WHO recommend Spirulina for it’s extremely high nutritional value and sustainability. It has even been called the ‘world’s most sustainable food’ with the potential to end world hunger. The Pole Pole Foundation in the Congo were finalists in the Earthshot Prize recently. They are leading the way to teach communities in developing countries how to grow Spirulina as a supplement to prevent childhood malnutrition.

Could Spirulina be an alternative vegan protein source?

Would you drink blue milk? Many vegans are looking for alternative sources of protein. Spirulina might even be a protein source of the future and a substitute for cow’s milk. Spirulina platensis stands out for being one of the richest protein sources of microbial origin having similar protein levels when compared to meat and soybeans. Not to be confused with regular green Spirulina in its basic form, blue Spirulina is an extract of the active ingredient phycocyanin in its purest form. This concentrates the dried extract with higher levels of antioxidants without so much of the fishy taste of fresh Spirulina. But if you don’t mind using fresh Spirulina (it’s fishy so it’s much better to mix with stronger flavours) it will provide protein that is quickly and easily absorbed in the body compared to animal proteins which is a bonus as it contains many essential amino acids that the body cannot synthesize alone and are essential for tissue renewal.

Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory

Fresh Spirulina is high in antioxidants, especially phycocyanin, the pigment which causes the blue green colour. Phycocyanin can promote blood cell regeneration, improve lymphocyte activity and improve the lymphatic system. Studies have shown this antioxidant scavenges and fights the free radicals that cause oxidative damage.

Spirulina is known to be alkalizing to the body which boosts beneficial microflora in the gut. Liver function is improved and this greatly increases detoxification levels in the body. Fresh Spirulina contains chlorophyll and phycocyanin both of which help to remove toxins such as heavy metals and other pollutants from the blood. One remarkable study in children who lived close to Chernobyl after the nuclear disaster in 1986 found that giving them a small 5g dose of Spirulina a day could reduce radionuclide rates by half in less than two months.

Spirulina has Cancer fighting benefits

Spirulina has been hailed as an anticancer superfood, but reading further into peer reviewed literature is important as there are some extrapolated and conflicting reports from doing a simple google search. So here we only present peer reviewed data. From our research low dose Spirulina has anti-proliferation effects on stomach cancer cells, human leukaemia cells and B lymphoma cells, inhibiting carcinogenesis.

Eating Spirulina daily may lead to increased energy levels

Fresh Spirulina is particularly good for energy owing to its high nutrient density. Since the algae has no cell wall to break down, digestion of all those nutrients is fast and efficient. It can make a difference to energy levels quickly after consumption. Fresh Spirulina contains constituents such as polysaccharides (Rhamnose and Glycogen) and essential fats that are absorbed easily by cells and theoretically aid energy release. More studies are needed to be truly conclusive though but with low toxicity levels in the body, it’s well worth your own trials.

Spirulina enhances energy performance because it unlocks sugar from our cells. If you are suffering from memory loss, this bacteria added daily to your routine appears to have significant effects. It does this by protecting the brain from free-radical damage by increasing the activity of two enzymes: catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which fight free radicals and make the brain more resistant to aging.

But It’s not all good news

Spirulina may exacerbate autoimmune reactions in some people who are susceptible. As such it may worsen symptoms of multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions linked to overactive immune systems. It’s also not recommended for pregnant women or children or people on blood thinners like warfarin. Be cautious where you purchase Spirulina, as it may be contaminated if not bought from a quality source, leading to additional side effects.

Bioavailability: Should it be dried or is live culture better?

Image credit: Ecoduna, Austria If you search for Spirulina online you are mainly going to encounter powdered products. There is nothing wrong with these as most research was conducted on using powdered forms which still showed positive results. However some reports suggest fresh Spirulina has up to 95% bioavailability. This means that 95% of the nutrients including essential amino acids, all the B vitamins and antioxidants are absorbed straight into your bloodstream increasing potency by 45% compared with powder.

How difficult is it to cultivate and commercialize?

Spirulina cultivation requires sufficient aeration, agitation and proper light intensity for enhanced biomass yield, cell productivity, specific growth rate and protein content. Biomass yield has the potential to reach up to 12g/l biomass in a closed reactor system. Urea seems to be a promising alternative source of low-cost nitrogen for Spirulina cultures and addition of mechanised aeration will significantly increase yields. Spirulina vats in a hothouse, Mexico

But what about algal blooms? Are they the same Cyanobacteria?

Spirulina itself is non toxic but other forms of blue green algae including Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, grown and harvested in the wild, is often contaminated and leads to toxic conditions when out of control.

Blue-green algae occurs naturally in lochs, ponds, reservoirs, rivers and the sea. This summer in Scotland it became a real issue. When the conditions are right, blue green algae will create massive blooms so large they can be captured by satellite imaging from space. Blooms are accelerated by leaching of fertilisers, with nitrogen and phosphorus runoff into the water course which becomes detrimental to other life forms by blocking oxygen and releasing toxic microcystins.

So it’s a logical step to grow these in a controlled environment and if market conditions continue to accelerate consumer demand for functional foods then growing these super algae in CEA could be highly profitable for farmers.

Image credit: Earthrise The largest US producer of Spirulina is based in California and they produce on an open 108 acre site, exporting to over 20 countries worldwide. There are disadvantages of open ponds as they do not reach high biomass productivity due to the difficulty of maintaining the optimum temperature and so they are restricted to tropical and subtropical regions. This is mitigated to some extent with large paddles constantly moving the ponds.

Despite this hefty competition, CEA could be the perfect vehicle for growing a crop that has incredible health properties, sequesters CO2 and can be grown in tubing to eliminate contamination. With LED lights and agitation, enhanced yields could be harvested year round.

This could be particularly useful between the shoulder winter months to increase profits and farm skills where wholesale prices have the potential to return profits of up to $15/Kg . A rough estimate of 12g/L biomass can be achieved with a photobioreactor system incorporating PPFD 166 μmol photons m−2 s−1 with potential doubling every 2-6 days depending on the algal species chosen. Based on this, and assuming you harvest 50% at each doubling time, a microfarm running 100L tanks could harvest 0.6Kg every 2 days, giving a total annual yield of 106.2Kg and a potential maximum annual return of $1593. Scaling up production will make more economic sense. Optimizing and automating additional technology (LED lighting, CO2 enhancement and state of the art infrastructure as seen with Algaennovation) may boost production but this must be carefully managed to balance a return on investment.

Learning and applying new ideas – food, fuel & carbon trap

Image courtesy of Energy Futures living laboratory project, Lille France We like to get people talking about the future diversity of CEA. This helps drive innovation and creates wider jobs and skills. At the same time we aim to help you better understand the science and health prospects of plants that could be grown in CEA. Of all the ideas out there, maybe our favourite is the idea of an algae curtain. Glow in the dark tubes of algae obscure prying eyes from your space while producing your own superfood or fuel. Could plants literally fuel plants in a completely carbon neutral circular economy? Biodiesel produced using algae contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and highly biodegradable. This could have potential in offsetting CEA energy outputs and algae fuel cells could make home farms more economically sustainable in the future. There are so many applications for algae, some are even using it to extract CO2 from brewing. Whatever reason you have for growing Spirulina and others (chlorella) there is no doubt about this being classed as a superfood.

Closer to home we like the way CEA farmers are looking to diversify their product range and kudos to On the Grow farms in Rockwall, Texas, growing spirulina alongside their microgreens. They grow in demijohn bottles adjusting the salinity to 2 and pH 10.5-11, harvesting and topping up fresh water every day. In order to maintain high pH and avoid fluctuations, high amounts of sodium bicarbonate must always be included in the culture medium to buffer the solution. The water needs aeration and temperature needs to be tightly regulated to 80F. LED lights will speed up production and your farm will literally bloom. Image credit: On The Grow Farms, Texas

Spirulina first rose to fame as a potential space food. Maybe in space our brains are altered by gravity to be more accepting of blue food. Or maybe we will discover a whole new superfood bacterial species on Mars or deep in the ocean. So who’s got a spare shelf in their vertical farm for this blue superfood and space age protein milk shake? Janet Colston PhD is pharmacologist with an interest in growing ‘functional’ foods that have additional phytonutrients and display medicinal qualities that are beneficial to human health. She grows these using a range of techniques including plant tissue micropropagation and controlled environmental agriculture to ensure the highest quality control.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin good,The Best Tranexamic Acid Products For Hyperpigmentation,"If you struggle at all with hyperpigmentation, chances are you’ve tried products with vitamin C or hydroquinone to reduce discoloration. Not knocking the efficacy of those ingredients here but there’s another player in the skincare game that might also hold the key to a more even complexion: tranexamic acid (or TXA for short). The ingredient is great at targeting hyperigmentation whether it be post-inflammatory or from melasma. The best part: It's very gentle and plays nicely with other ingredients—including actives that can be temperamental to mix with.



What is tranexamic acid?

“Tranexamic acid is an acid derived from a synthetic form of lysine,” says Dr. Farhaad Riyaz, a board-certified dermatologist and medical advisor for Docent, a prescription skincare brand. “In the skincare arena, it is used topically to treat hyperpigmentation, PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), and melasma (hormonally-induced hyperpigmentation).”

What does tranexamic acid do?

According to Dr. Riyaz, tranexamic acid attacks melanin production by inhibiting tyrosinase, the enzyme that’s responsible for pigmentation. “It does not exfoliate or stimulate collagen, so it is typically combined with other medications,” he adds. Specifically, tranexamic acid's mild enough to be used in conjunction with other brighteners like niacinamide and kojic acid as well as typically well-tolerated when combined with tretinoin and other active ingredients you may be using to target the signs of aging like fine lines and wrinkles.

How do you use tranexamic acid?

If you’re ready to give this new gentle but efficacious ingredient a try, Dr. Riyaz recommends looking for a serum, moisturizer, or peel with tranexamic acid in it. “The ideal concentration of tranexamic acid ranges from 3 to 5 percent, which is the amount proven to be effective in clinical studies,” he says. Typically, you can apply, say, a serum with tranexamic acid in it daily, morning or night, and even up to twice a day, but you should always start slow and patch test new products on your skin in an inconspicuous area first. According to Dr. Riyaz, tranexamic acid is suitable for all skin types and tones, and based on clinical trials, the only real side effects are dryness, irritation, and potentially a little flaking with use.

Can you use tranexamic acid if you're pregnant or breastfeeding?

For best results, keep these other tranexamic acid pointers in mind. “As with other ingredients and treatments for hyperpigmentation, daily use of a sunscreen with an SPF of 30+ is a must to help control hyperpigmentation,” says Dr. Riyaz. Also, because topical tranexamic acid hasn’t been studied in pregnant or breastfeeding women, you should always consult your dermatologist and obstetrician before beginning use in those cases. tranexamic acid can also be a great alternative for those sensitive to hydroquinone or anyone who wants to take a break from it for whatever reason. Just don’t expect an overnight change with tranexamic acid, and consistency is key. “Most people will notice results with consistent use in eight to 12 weeks,” says Riyaz.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin good,"Here are the best vegetables for your health, according to nutritionists","It pays to love your veggies. Especially when you’re loading up on some of the healthiest in the vegetable kingdom. Read on for a list of nutritionist-approved go-to veggies to support good health.

1. Shiitake mushrooms

“Shiitake mushrooms are not only a low-calorie vegetable but have been shown to reduce inflammation and benefit immune function by increasing secretory IgA, which serves as the first line of defense in the body protecting us from pathogens,” says Erin Kenney, MS, RD, registered dietitian CEO of Nutrition Rewired. “Try throwing them into a stir-fry over rice.” We also love serving these tasty mushrooms as a side dish, sautéed with garlic and scallion.

2. Sweet potatoes

Already regularly eating this nutrient-dense and fiber-filled tuber? Keep it up. “Sweet potatoes are considered a functional food, as they contain many nutrients that human beings need for optimal health,” says Jared T. Meacham, Ph.D., RD, PMP, CSCS, president (2022-2023) DC Metro Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, noting that they are a source of both soluble and insoluble fiber. “These promote gut health by helping to clean the gastrointestinal tract while softening stool and helping to maintain a healthful internal environment,” Meacham explains. Additionally, sweet potatoes are a quality carbohydrate source, says Meacham, and one cup contains over half of a person’s recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin A, vitamin C, and manganese. “The antioxidants contained in sweet potatoes protect cells from damage and may have anti-cancer properties, specifically in colorectal cells,” he adds.

3. Jicama

“Jicama is a refreshing, crunchy vegetable that is rich in prebiotic fiber. Research has shown the type of fiber in jicama may prevent excessive blood glucose and body weight increase,” says Kenney, who suggests dicing this veggie into a salad or dipping it in hummus for a satisfying snack. The root veggie also makes a welcome addition to smoothies.

4. Green peas

Let’s hear it for these tiny green stars. “Green peas have a unique nutrient profile because they not only supply quality starchy carbohydrates but also provide a significant amount of fiber and protein, per serving, making them a highly nutritious source of these important nutrients,” says Meacham. “This is why pea protein supplementation is in such demand for both vegans and non-vegans looking for plant proteins to supplement their diet. Additionally, green peas contain saponins, which have been demonstrated to be effective at combating cancers. P.S. Frozen green peas are also affordable and keep in the freezer for a long time.”

5. Broccoli sprouts

“Broccoli sprouts release a phytochemical called sulforaphane which can help heal the gut, reduce inflammation, and could even help fight cancer by enhancing antioxidant activities,” says Kenney. “Sulforaphane has been shown to increase Phase II detoxification enzymes and/or antioxidant enzymes, which detoxify your body of potential carcinogens and other disease-causing compounds,” she continues, noting that it’s easy to grow your own broccoli sprouts at home. Throw them in a sandwich or a smoothie, she suggests.

6. Garlic

Part of the onion family, garlic may not be a boon for your breath, but it sure is one for your health. “Garlic is an amazing vegetable whose active ingredient, allicin, is the primary reason for its many healthful properties. Many of garlic’s most impactful health benefits center around its likely ability to help decrease LDL cholesterol while increasing HDL [or ‘good’] cholesterol,” comments Meacham. “Additionally, some research suggests that garlic contains properties that combat various kinds of cancer, with some research identifying liver cancer as a likely form of the disease that allicin may be effective in combating.” For what it’s worth, raw garlic contains more allicin than the cooked version, so try consuming it raw if you can, like minced into a salad dressing or a clove or two blended into a smoothie.

7. Kimchi

Pass the kimchi, please. “Kimchi, a fermented Korean vegetable mixture, has been shown to decrease levels of cholesterol in the body,” comments Kenney. “Fermented foods help to boost the beneficial bacteria in the gut, which has been shown to improve immune function.” The popular condiment tastes great in soups or mixed into savory entrée dishes. Buy it online or in the Asian foods section of your local grocer.

8. Beets

A bit messy, but well worth the cleanup. “Beets contain the antioxidant betalains, which give red beetroots their natural, vibrant red color. Beetroots are also a great source of vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin K, calcium and iron,” says Alyssa Burnison, MS, RD, LN, of ProfilePlan.com. “Given the antioxidant properties of betalains, they can protect our cells against DNA damage and provide anti-cancer properties,” she adds, pointing to this research.

9. Carrots

If you’re reading this and have baby carrots in your fridge, go ahead and grab a few to snack on right now. Mission accomplished? OK, great. “Carrots are commonly known for their rich sources of vitamin A and carotenoids, specifically beta-carotene,” says Burnison. “Your body converts the beta-carotene to vitamin A, which has been known to support immune function and eye health,” she says, highlighting this scientific review on carrots.

10. Brussels sprouts

“Brussels sprouts fall into the family of cruciferous vegetables and are a great source of vitamin C, vitamin K, soluble fiber and folate,” shares Burnison. “Soluble fiber, in particular, has been shown to help regulate blood sugar as it becomes a gel-like substance within the gut once digested. This can help prevent blood sugar spikes and decrease risk of type 2 diabetes.” Aarón Sánchez’s Brussels sprouts salad, anyone?

11. Spirulina

Bonus algae pick! It’s time to add this superfood to your diet: “Spirulina is technically a form of blue-green algae, but is often considered a ‘sea vegetable’ and is typically [sold in] powder form [for use in increasing] the nutrient profile of shakes and smoothies,” shares Meacham. You can also try sprinkling some into your favorite chia seed pudding or oatmeal preparation. “It packs a considerable amount of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds like C-phycocyanin (C-PC) in even the smallest serving,” says Meacham. “Spirulina supplementation has also been shown to help balance blood sugar and blood lipid profiles of people with Type 2 Diabetes. Likewise, spirulina has shown promise in research designed to determine its ability to combat oral cancer cells.”",,[]
phycocyanin,phycocyanin good,I Tried Kourtney Kardashian’s Viral Breakfast and I’m Mad About How Good It Is,"This article originally appeared on Vegetarian Times

Now that Kourtney Kardashian has transitioned from famous-because-she's-rich person to professional wellness guru thanks to her website, Poosh, the 42-year-old's workout routines, beauty regime, and, recipes have become the subject of intense internet scrutiny. Perhaps none more so than the TikTok-viral avocado pudding.

After sharing a cup of the pale green pudding with Addison Rae in a YouTube video, the goop Kardashian claims she's eaten for breakfast every day for the past five years took off on its own trajectory - earning a mixed bag of fevered admiration and outright disgust. ""I wish everyone understood how good this is,"" Rae proclaimed, seemingly earnestly in the clip. But not everyone who tried the recipe had such a favorable opinion.

TikToker @myhealthydish said ""it tasted like baby food."" In another video, @eitan calls it ""mutant ninja jelly,"" and, in what is perhaps my favorite review, @tandisss says it looks and tastes like ""it came out of Shrek's asshole.""

The original recipe feels a bit extra (and not even entirely vegetarian). In addition to avocado, milk (any kind, but Kourt uses her homemade macadamia milk, of course), and sweetener, it calls for ingredients like MCT Oil, vanilla bone broth protein powder, and BrainOn (""a Refractance WindowTM dried, concentrated organic E3AFA (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) extract of Phycocyanin and Phenylethylamine (PEA)""), none of which I happened to have on hand. Fortunately, a simplified version, sans supplements, exists.

I was fully prepared to hate Kourt's avocado pudding-smoothie. I was already distraught about potentially wasting an avocado to try it, but try it I did, for you, reader, and what I discovered shocked me to my core.

Story continues

It's kind of...good? Kourtney Kardashian and Addison Rae were...right???

My first attempt was as close to the original as possible -- one avocado, one can of coconut milk, and a big spoonful of Makuna honey (Kourt's preferred variety). Straight out of the blender, I found it to be creamy, a little sweet, and actually quite pleasant. I could imagine how lovely it would be right after a grueling workout, if grueling workouts were my kind of thing.

But I didn't stop there. After watching 100 TikTok videos of people riffing on this recipe, I had a few hunches about potential enhancements. So, I put the blender pitcher back on its base and added a banana, a cup of ice cubes, and a big squeeze of lime juice, and the result was, hand to god, delicious. I was so surprised, I was almost mad.

Avocado desserts are nothing new, and you probably won't be surprised to learn that Kardashian did not, in fact, invent them. She credits her child Reign’s Brazilian nanny for introducing her to the idea, which she modified to fit her lifestyle. In Brazil, something similar to this known as Creme de Abacate, and as many TikTokers point out, there's also Sinh To Bo, a refreshing Vietnamese drink that combines avocado, ice, and condensed, sweetened milk.

Inspired by TikTok user @nicole_thenomad, I decided to further gild the lily, turning my avocado pudding concoction into a smoothie bowl situation, with mango, fresh berries, and homemade granola, and maybe this is a breakfast I'll eat again? Maybe even every day for five years, I'm not sure! I'm not sure about anything anymore...

phycocyanin,phycocyanin good,10 Best Spirulina Supplements Reviewed for 2022 – Fitness Volt,"Spirulina, cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, is an organism that thrives both in fresh and saltwater. It produces energy through photosynthesis and is considered the most nutritious food on the planet. The microorganism is naturally grown and cultivated, then manufactured with an organic method that preserves its purity and nutritional value.

Spirulina is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. It is also known to lower harmful cholesterol levels, helps in regulating blood sugar levels, and possibly reduce blood pressure. Other benefits include aiding in allergic rhinitis, effective against anemia, and improving muscle endurance. Of course, most of these claims are still subject to further scientific studies and research, but strong indications suggest improvements in individuals currently administered with the supplement.

How we ranked

There are vast numbers of spirulina supplements existing in the market, and they claim to offer hundreds of wonders for you. Because we know choosing one can be very challenging, we give you a list of the criteria we used to evaluate each product.

Brand promise

Is the brand promising to cure an illness in a month completely, and all you need is to take a few capsules of some grams of powder? Be cautious of companies making bizarre claims. Remember that wellness and overall healthy body function is not an overnight success, but an arduous and time-consuming effort.

Brand character

Are you familiar with this brand or company? Are they known in the health and wellness industry? Maybe you know a friend or acquaintance who is familiar with them? You can check them out in Better Business Bureau or Trustpilot to make sure there is nothing suspicious about the brand before making any choices.

Product format

Many spirulina supplements come in capsule or tablet form, while others come in powder form. The form doesn’t influence the product’s effectiveness so that you can make any choice according to your preference.

Quantities and amounts

Always be mindful of the number of capsules or tablets per serving, as well as per container. This step also applies to products in powder form. All those features affect the overall product value.

Value for your money

At times, the price can be an indication of quality or, in the case of supplements, potency; if it is very low compared to other brands, the dosages may not be enough or include unproven components. On the other hand, if it is too expensive, it should have the correct amounts of essential ingredients.

GMO-free

An essential factor, the supplement must not contain any genetically modified organism.

Presence of metallic compounds and allergens

Spirulina is naturally grown or cultivated. As such, there should be no heavy metals present. Although some have substantial iron amounts incorporated in the supplement, this is not dangerous as iron is even introduced into baby formulations during infancy.

Another vital indication is the absence of allergens like gluten, egg, lactose, soy, corn, and others.

FDA/cGMP certifications and approvals

It is crucial to discern that a product contains safe and high-quality ingredients. One perfect way to find out is by checking if the products are made in cGMP/FDA approved or certified facilities and processes. There are other third-party certifications and seals for other essential matters about ingredients and components. Some of these are the Halal and Kosher certifications, the Ecocert, USDA, EU Organic, Naturland, and others.

In instances when you don’t have acquaintances that have tried the product before, you can check out websites like iherb.com or Amazon, as well as other online sites associated with health and wellness campaigns.

Who Should Purchase Spirulina supplements?

Individuals with allergies

Research and studies have shown that spirulina could moderate immune function, advancing the allergic rhinitis symptoms via an unknown technique.

Individuals with cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes

Clinical experiments have identified cholesterol- and glucose-lowering effects of spirulina.

People in a state of malnutrition

Because it is densely packed with essential nutrients, spirulina is a high-value nutritional supplement. That is especially important in individuals who are HIV-positive and are malnourished at the same time.

People who are exposed to high arsenic content in drinking water

A critical study has indicated that spirulina could be used to treat individuals with protracted arsenic poisoning caused by contaminated drinking water.

Individuals who have weak immune systems

Spirulina holds immunity-enhancing effects, which can be useful in fighting cancers and viral infections. Moreover, spirulina may have direct antiviral activity.

There is no conclusive evidence that currently indicates the use of spirulina as individual therapy, or to replace conventional treatment for each of the indications mentioned earlier. We recommend consulting your doctor before altering your treatment program.

How Do I Choose a Good Spirulina Supplement?

Effective spirulina supplements should be manufactured by respectable companies that rigorously abide by good manufacturing practices (GMP). They must be essentially free of microcystins and heavy metal contamination.

Furthermore, they should not contain any GMO or genetically modified organisms and should be free of allergens such as gluten, egg, lactose, soy, corn, etc.

The mode or form of dosage is also of import in selecting the best spirulina supplement for your needs. Most come either in pill/tablet/capsule or pure powder form. Whichever type you choose does not affect the potency or effectivity of the product in any way.

Price is also an indication of potency and effectiveness. Most of the spirulina brands have comparable price ranges, thus giving you a guide at a reasonable cost. Anything grossly too low or too expensive is suspect and should be considered with care before purchasing.

Other pluses would be certifications or seals of approval by reputable organizations within the health and wellness communities, quality circles, and standardization institutions. Examples of such are Halal, Kosher, Eurocert, USDA, among others.

Lastly, it wouldn’t hurt to check out the feedback from other users. You may have acquaintances that are familiar with some of the brands. Otherwise, hundreds of reviews, health and wellness websites and online shopping sites (like Amazon, iHerb, etc.) feature lots of user feedback. Most of these are excellent sources of information, not just for prospective buyers, but also for the manufacturers themselves as an alternative feedback system.

With all that in mind, you can now start your deliberation in choosing the best option that will suit your needs and preferences. For additional information to help you in your selection, please continue reading on the following sections on spirulina’s benefits, possible side effects, dosage recommendation, frequently-asked questions, and our final summary with suggestions.

What Are Spirulina’s Benefits?

Spirulina, cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, is popularly referred to as a “superfood.” It has become the theme of about a thousand highly acclaimed scientific papers, and a vast number of research findings. Some principal spirulina applications include:

Nutrient-filled

Spirulina is a microorganism that is highly rich in nutrients. One tablespoon of pure spirulina powder contains typically 4 grams of protein, vast amounts of copper, magnesium, iron, vitamin B complex, and more. Spirulina is considered by many as the best nutritious food on earth gram-for-gram. Due to this, spirulina is mixed with several energy bars, health supplements, and superfood blends. In other words, spirulina functions as the best source of amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and various nutrients essential to the normal function of our bodies.

Anti-inflammatory & antioxidant

Spirulina is known to have powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The foremost active complex in it is phycocyanin. Interestingly the very compound provides spirulina its distinctive hue. Phycocyanin has powerful anti-inflammatory properties, and also defends from oxidative damage triggered by radical elements. Oxidation-related stress can amplify the danger of several health issues, such as cancer, causing several experts to consider that antioxidants similar to those present in spirulina can aid in reducing the danger of cancer acquisition.

Cholesterol

Spirulina, in many instances, is believed to possess a beneficial influence on cholesterol quantities, theoretically reducing triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. It is also useful in increasing (HDL) “good” cholesterol levels while decreasing “bad” cholesterol. So, spirulina can aid in lowering a number of threat aspects for heart diseases and various severe health issues.

Cancer

Spirulina was able to reveal some potential in averting the growth of cancer, mostly oral cancers. One research in India monitored a group of 87 people having pre-cancerous lesions inside their mouths. One year after continuous spirulina administration, 45% of the participants indicated full degeneration of cancerous-like lesions, as opposed to only 7% in the control population. Spirulina has presented substantial potential in dealing with oral cancers, although some scientists think it could have the capacity for a wide variety of cancers. Further research is necessary.

Blood pressure

Certain pieces of evidence indicate that spirulina can aid in lowering blood pressure. That effect is due to spirulina’s influence on the production of nitric oxide, which assists blood vessels, causing them to relax and dilate. Additional research is required.

Exercise

Spirulina can aid in boosting exercise endurance and performance. Oxidative harmful effects towards the muscles are brought about by exercise, thereby contributing to muscle weakness. The antioxidant activity of spirulina is believed to negate particular oxidative damage, enabling athletes to function longer without getting exhausted.

Blood sugar

Many animal studies show spirulina being a promising instrument in managing glucose levels in blood and diabetes indications. Spirulina mostly beat prescription medications for diabetes in some instances. Clinical confirmations in the human trial are incomplete, but a minor study discovered a substantial drop of blood sugar amounts in patients with diabetes (type-2). Further research is required.

Generally, spirulina is exceptionally nutritious and possesses a plethora of latent health advantages. It is a scarce food that is deserving of being called “superfood.” The amount of nutrient contained is sufficient to contemplate spirulina consumption, not to mention its potential for considerable health benefits.

Side Effects of Spirulina

In 2011, the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), through its Dietary Supplements Information Expert Committee (DSI-EC), appointed spirulina a ‘class A’ safety rating, signifying that the existing scientific evidence does not pose a severe health risk.

On its own, spirulina is mostly safe to consume and has no side effects. However, problems can occur if the spirulina gets contaminated with heavy metals and other toxic pollutants. Arsenic, mercury, or lead poisoning could come from inadvertently consuming contaminated spirulina. One other potential spirulina contaminant is microcystin, a toxin that can damage livers.

Most of the spirulina supplements suggest the avoidance of intake for pregnant women and nursing mothers. Also important is keeping the product away from children and minors. Of course, the best recommendation is to consult your doctor before consuming any of the supplement brands.

Recommended dosage

Spirulina supplements usually come in either dried powder form or capsules/tablets. Capsules are more expedient to take, but the powder can be mixed into bread, salads, smoothies, or used as seasonings in various foods. The option of form and method of consumption depends on personal choice, and whatever is utilized would yield the same results.

The typical spirulina dosage is from 2.8 to 3.0 grams per day. That’s about 5-6 tablets (500mg) or a teaspoon of powder a day. Of course, that is subject to the recommendation of a health specialist or a physician.

FAQs

What is Spirulina?

Spirulina is the popular name for two microorganism species: Arthrospira maxima and Arthrospira platensis. While it is often referred to as blue-green algae, the spirulina being used in several dietary supplements theoretically belongs to the group Cyanobacteria, a type of non-infectious bacteria that is named after its bluish hue.

Which spirulina species is used frequently?

Of the two spirulina species, the most commonly used in nutritional supplements is the spirulina platensis.

Where is spirulina found?

Spirulina is usually seen naturally propagating in tropical regions and by the lakes as biomass or microorganism. It is usually cultivated and utilized as a whole food by itself, or processed into powder as dietary supplements. The Aztecs were the first to utilize it as a customary food source.

Why is spirulina called a “superfood?”

Spirulina contains substantial amounts of essential amino acids, vital fatty acids, glycolipids, minerals, polysaccharides, proteins, and vitamins. Protein takes up nearly 70% of spirulina’s dry weight, which is about thrice as much as beef protein! Spirulina provides about 290 calories/100 grams of the “superfood” that it has been considered a strategic player in the discussion to focus on food scarcity and security concerns.

What nutrients does spirulina have?

The most excellent spirulina supplements provide amino acids, iron (including other minerals), protein, vitamins, and beneficial lipids such as gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Some spirulina supplements are also reinforced with additional minerals and nutrients, augmenting the benefits of full dried spirulina or its extract.

Does spirulina have special uses?

Also, because of its exceptionally high nutritional value and straightforwardness of cultivation, NASA scientists have suggested that spirulina be grown and utilized as a food source by astronauts while on missions in space!

""Shiitake mushrooms are not only a low-calorie vegetable but have been shown to reduce inflammation and benefit immune function by increasing secretory IgA, which serves as the first line of defense in the body protecting us from pathogens,"" says Erin Kenney, MS, RD, registered dietitian CEO of Nutrition Rewired. ""Try throwing them into a stir-fry over rice."" We also love serving these tasty mushrooms as a side dish, sautéed with garlic and scallion.

2. Sweet potatoes

Already regularly eating this nutrient-dense and fiber-filled tuber? Keep it up. ""Sweet potatoes are considered a functional food , as they contain many nutrients that human beings need for optimal health,"" says Jared T. Meacham, Ph.D., RD, PMP, CSCS, president (2022-2023) DC Metro Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, noting that they are a source of both soluble and insoluble fiber. ""These promote gut health by helping to clean the gastrointestinal tract while softening stool and helping to maintain a healthful internal environment,"" Meacham explains. Additionally, sweet potatoes are a quality carbohydrate source, says Meacham, and one cup contains over half of a person's recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin A, vitamin C, and manganese. ""The antioxidants contained in sweet potatoes protect cells from damage and may have anti-cancer properties, specifically in colorectal cells,"" he adds.

3. Jicama

""Jicama is a refreshing, crunchy vegetable that is rich in prebiotic fiber.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin good,"Buoys placed in Lake Erie, act as floating laboratories","CLEVELAND — Four high-tech buoys acting as floating laboratories are placed in central Lake Erie each May to collect data, monitor water quality and much more.

What You Need To Know Four smart buoys monitor water quality in central Lake Erie as part of the Smart Lake Erie Watershed Initiative



It’s a collaborative project from Cleveland Water Alliance, Cleveland Water, and Limnotech



The buoys help give the water department advance notice of potential water quality issues and much more



Other industries such as fishing and boating use the public data from the buoys ​

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 11 million people depend on Lake Erie for drinking water, including about 3 million people in Ohio and about 1.4 million in Cleveland.

Scott Moegling, the water quality manager for Cleveland Water, looks forward to the day each year when the four smart buoys are placed in central Lake Erie to collect data on water conditions.

“They're expensive, but they're worth it. We've learned a lot of good information, and a better understanding of Lake Erie and and water quality in the water that we treat,"" Moegling said. ""If you'd have told me 30 years ago that I'd be looking at satellite imagery and using remote laboratories out in the lake to help me treat water, I probably would have laughed and said no way, but here we are.”

The buoys are deployed by environmental scientists from Limnotech, the water science and engineering firm which engineers the buoys. The first buoy deployed in 2010, then the next came in 2016 and two more last year.

“This one is going to go out three-and-a-half miles. We've got one that's 12 miles out they're putting out right now,"" he said. ""We'll have another one over at Nottingham, it'll be about three-and-a-half miles and then one over at our Crown Water Plant over off of Westlake, that one will be about three miles offshore.”

The buoys’ gathered information is sent to an online monitoring system 24 hours a day where it is viewed by Cleveland Water staff and the public. The buoys help give the water department hours of advanced notice of a water quality issue long before the water is drawn into a treatment plant.

“By getting that extra lead time, we can not only gear up manpower, we can gear up chemicals, we can anticipate needed changes,” Moegling said. “We can increase testing and be more vigilant when we know that something may be coming at us.”

The sensors on the buoys track a variety of things including temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, phycocyanin, which is a blue-green algae pigment, chlorophyll, which is an algae pigment, and other things that the water department can use to identify water quality parameters they need for treatment.

The data isn’t just useful to the water department. Many other industries like fishing and boating benefit. Moegling said the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and the Coast Guard use the buoys' data.

“The fishing industry, they'll use our dissolved oxygen data and to identify where to go fish, you know, if there's a low oxygen then the fish won't be there,” Moegling said. “Boaters use it, the wave height, wave period, the wind speed and directions are important for boaters.”

In 2021, Cleveland Water Alliance (CWA), Cleveland Water, and LimnoTech activated the Smart Lake Erie Watershed, an award-winning regional smart water monitoring network. It's the first of it's kind in the nation and is used to inform and improve public health, safety, utility operations, supply chain management, and water security throughout Greater Cleveland. Because of this advanced technology, Lake Erie is one of the most studied and digitally-connected bodies of freshwater on earth. Moegling said other organizations have their own smart buoys deployed on the lake as well for other reasons.

“It’s great that we have this beautiful resource right here for us to use and to enjoy and to recreate on,” Moegling said. “We’re getting a better understanding about the lake itself. Once we understand that, and understand all the complexities of the lake, then we can manage it better.”

The organization asks that people stay at least 100 feet away from the buoys, especially fishermen who are trawling behind their boats.

“Cleveland water has great treatment,” Moegling said. “We put out high quality water that meets all the regulations and then beyond. And we're really proud of the quality of water that we're able to put out.”

phycocyanin,phycocyanin good,Spirulina benefits: Effects of spirulina on sport performances,"Spirulina is type of blue-green algae rich in nutrients and antioxidants and it is also one of the most popular nutritional supplements in the world. As a result, spirulina is associated with a number of positive health effects, most notably effects which apply to the area of sport performances.

Here, we take a closer look at how spirulina affects sporting performances.

First of all, spirulina is 55-70 percent protein, which is a percentage significantly larger than those of beef (25 percent protein) and eggs (13 percent). Therefore, this makes spirulina a key source of long-lasting energy for athletes, whilst assisting them with muscle growth and improving stamina.

Given that it is algae, it is also far easier than the likes of lentils, beef and cow's milk to digest, as there is no extra cell membrane to break down. Whilst the net protein use of spirulina is around 52 percent, those of lentils, beef and cow's milk are 30 percent, 15 percent and 12 percent respectively.

Furthermore, spirulina contains a pigment called phycocyanin which gives it its unique blue-green colour. It is a key antioxidant which assists athletes with anti-inflammation. This can be a significant aid to athletes given the amount of physical stress which they endure on a regular basis.

What other health benefits does spirulina bring?

Aside from a strictly sporting perspective, there is evidence that spirulina may have anti-cancer properties and that it may reduce blood pressure.

For example, in a recent study in India involving 87 people with precancerous lesions, among those who took one gram of spirulina per day for one year 45 percent of these people saw the lesions disappear.

With regards to a reduction in blood pressure, a dose of 4.5 grams per day has been proven to reduce the blood pressure of individuals with normal levels.",,[]
phycocyanin,phycocyanin bad,Is Protein Powder Bad for You? Downsides and More,"Protein powder is one of the top nutrition supplements on the market. Some people use it to support muscle growth, and others use it because they want to consume more protein than they’re getting from food alone. Protein powder can be part of a balanced diet. However, you may wonder if consuming a lot of protein powder can be harmful. The short answer is no, but it may have minor side effects. This article discusses whether consuming too much protein powder is dangerous, reviews the research on its side effects, and examines some misconceptions about protein powder. Share on Pinterest Mattia/Stocksy United

What is protein powder? Protein powders are concentrated forms of protein from animal or plant sources. You can buy them at many health food stores and online, and there’s a wide range of brands, types, and flavors to choose from. Animal-based protein powders are usually made of two milk proteins called whey and casein, with whey being more popular. While less common, protein powders containing beef or chicken protein are also available. Whey protein powder is isolated from whey, a liquid byproduct of cheese making that manufacturers spray-dry into a powder ( 1 , 2 ). Plant protein powders can be made from various plant-based proteins, such as brown rice, pea, soy, and hemp. Typically, plant-based protein powders contain a blend of plant proteins ( 3 ). Both types of protein powder will generally provide 20–30 grams of protein per scoop, so they are a great way to get additional protein in your diet. They also commonly contain added vitamins, flavors, and sweeteners. People often use protein powder after workouts to support muscle growth. Your muscles need enough protein to rebuild muscle tissue after a strength training workout ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). You might use it if you have difficulty meeting your daily protein needs through food alone — for example, if you aren’t eating large amounts of food or you’re following a vegan diet ( 8 , 9 , 10 ). That said, if you’re getting enough protein through food, it’s unlikely that you’ll see much benefit from taking protein powder. The DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) for protein is 0.36 grams of protein per pound (0.8 grams per kg) of your body weight per day. However, if you’re aiming to build muscle, this can go up to 0.6–0.9 grams per pound (1.4–2.0 grams per kg) per day. A good general rule is to try to get 20–40 grams of protein per meal ( 4 , 5 , 11 , 12 ). Summary Protein powder is a concentrated form of protein from plant or animal sources. Available types include whey, casein, pea, soy, and rice.

Is protein powder bad for you? Simply put, protein powder is not bad for you. It’s a convenient source of protein that helps many people meet their daily protein needs. Of course, if you have allergies to a certain type of protein or other ingredients in a protein powder, then it will cause you to have an allergic reaction. In that case, you should avoid that type of protein powder. The ingredients in protein powders vary significantly among brands and products. While the Food and Drug Administration regulates dietary supplements such as protein powder, manufacturers are responsible for evaluating the safety, effectiveness, and labeling of their products ( 13 , 14 ). This means that the labels on protein powders and other dietary supplements could provide misleading ingredient or product information. In fact, one study found that numerous protein powders actually contained lower-cost proteins such as chicken, rice, and soy ( 15 ). Though this is rare, protein powders may sometimes contain harmful ingredients or substances that have been banned in sports. Fortunately, many reputable protein powder brands use third-party testing to demonstrate their products’ safety and transparency ( 16 ). Try to select a protein powder from a reputable company with third-party testing. And make an effort to eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of protein-rich whole foods, such as lean meats, poultry, eggs, beans, lentils, tofu, nuts, and seeds. Summary Protein powder is not bad for you. Some protein powders may contain unwanted or harmful ingredients, but this is rare. Be sure to buy powders that have been through third-party testing — they will say this on the label.

Misconceptions about protein powder You might be worried about taking too much protein powder because you’ve heard that it affects your liver, kidneys, or bones. But research has shown that these claims are false. Here’s a look at these misconceptions in detail. Kidney and liver function One major concern some people raise about taking protein powder is that it affects the kidneys and liver. Experts once thought that too much protein could damage the kidneys and liver in healthy people, but many recent studies have disproven this ( 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ). In one study, 48 men and women consumed a high protein diet from both food and whey-beef protein powder during an 8-week heavy resistance training program. Those who took the protein powder didn’t have any difference in kidney function ( 21 ). However, those with kidney disease or decreased kidney function have more difficulty excreting protein waste products in their urine and will need to monitor their protein intake. Decreased kidney function is defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 90 ( 22 , 23 ). Therefore, unless you have chronic kidney disease or decreased kidney function, consuming protein powder and other high protein foods is likely safe. Bone health People once thought a high protein diet was harmful for bone health. This myth was rooted in the idea that protein’s high acid content “stripped” bones of their calcium, leading to high calcium levels in the urine and weaker bones ( 24 ). However, current research suggests that a high protein diet may actually boost bone health. Researchers believe it does this by promoting calcium absorption, supporting the growth of skeletal muscle mass, and preserving bone mass during weight loss ( 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ). In an 18-month high quality study, 280 older men and women consumed 45 grams of whey protein or a placebo each day. Results showed no differences in bone composition between the groups ( 28 ). Interestingly, the whey protein group preserved significantly more muscle mass, suggesting that protein may help reduce age-related muscle loss. This may benefit bone health by allowing aging people to stay active longer ( 28 ). Summary To date, there is no evidence that consuming protein powder or high protein foods is harmful to bone, liver, or kidney health. If you have kidney issues, speak with a doctor before taking protein powder to make sure it’s safe for you.

Potential digestive issues Protein powders are generally recognized as safe, although you may experience digestive side effects if you consume large amounts of protein powder. If you’re lactose intolerant or otherwise sensitive to lactose, dairy-based protein powder may lead to stomach upset, bloating, and gas. Instead, opt for a plant-based protein powder or try whey protein isolate, which is much lower in lactose than other dairy protein powders ( 29 ). If you want to use plant-based protein powder, read the ingredient label carefully to identify any potential food allergens or sensitivities. For example, soy and gluten are common allergens found in plant-based protein powders ( 30 ). Furthermore, those who have irritable bowel syndrome or are sensitive to FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols) may experience bloating and cramping from pea protein powder or powders with added sugar alcohols ( 31 ). Companies may add sugar alcohols as low calorie sweeteners. Trial and error will help you determine the best protein powder for you. Summary The main side effects of consuming a lot of protein powder are digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and cramping. If you have any food sensitivities, be sure to read the label first.

How much is too much? Most people’s bodies can process excess protein from food and supplements and can safely tolerate 1.14–1.5 grams per pound (2.5–3.3 grams per kg) of protein per day ( 4 , 32 ). However, more research is needed to investigate an upper limit for protein powder consumption. Until then, if you want to use protein powder, stick to 1–2 servings per day and get the rest of your protein through food. Summary There’s no known safety limit for protein powder. Most research shows healthy people can tolerate up to 1.5 grams of protein per pound (3.3 grams per kg) of body weight per day from both food and protein supplements with no side effects.

Is protein powder safe for children and teens? Protein is important for growth and development during childhood and adolescence. Most experts agree that children and teens should get their protein from food sources such as ( 33 , 34 , 35 ): meat

poultry

dairy

beans

lentils

eggs

tofu In some cases, a healthcare professional might recommend that a child take a protein supplement, such as PediaSure, if the child is malnourished, is a picky eater, or has strict dietary restrictions. While there is no data to suggest that protein powder is harmful to children and teens, relying on protein powder and supplements may displace nutritious, whole foods in the diet. Therefore, protein-rich whole foods should come first ( 36 ). If you’re concerned that your child or teen isn’t getting enough protein, speak with a registered dietitian, a qualified nutritionist, or your child’s doctor. Summary Children and teens should aim to get their protein from food first to ensure they’re getting enough calories and nutrients. A healthcare professional may recommend a protein supplement for picky eaters or those with malnutrition.

Other things to consider Protein powder can be a great addition to a balanced diet. However, here are a few important considerations. Purchasing a safe protein powder It might feel overwhelming to choose a protein powder from the many available options online or at the health food store. Here are a few things you can do to make it easier: Look for third-party testing. Check product labels for certifications from reputable third-party organizations such as NSF International’s Certified for Sport, USP, Informed Choice, ConsumerLab, and the Banned Substances Control Group.

Check product labels for certifications from reputable third-party organizations such as NSF International’s Certified for Sport, USP, Informed Choice, ConsumerLab, and the Banned Substances Control Group. Read the label. If you’re looking to avoid a certain ingredient, be sure to read the label carefully. In addition to the ingredients list, a label may give information about a product, such as whether it’s vegan or gluten-free.

If you’re looking to avoid a certain ingredient, be sure to read the label carefully. In addition to the ingredients list, a label may give information about a product, such as whether it’s vegan or gluten-free. Look at the serving size. The best protein powders will contain 20–30 grams of protein per scoop. Use it as a supplement, not a replacement Though protein powder can be a great addition to your diet, you don’t need to consume it to be healthy. Whole, protein-rich foods contain vitamins and minerals that are important for health. What’s more, they take longer to digest than protein powder, so they may make you feel full longer. On the other hand, protein powder is considered “predigested” and will leave your stomach more quickly after you consume it than whole foods do ( 37 ). Instead, use protein powder to supplement your balanced diet at times when you may not be able to meet your protein needs. Summary When shopping for a protein powder, look at the label to ensure the product has been third-party tested and doesn’t contain any unwanted ingredients. Ideally, use protein powder in addition to a nutritious diet, not as a replacement for one.",,"['Katey Davidson', 'Mscfn', 'Rd']"
phycocyanin,phycocyanin bad,"Venus sounds like the last place for life, but…could photosynthesis happen in its clouds?","Raging with unbearable heat and covered in swirls of toxic clouds, Venus is a hell world for humans. But something might actually be able to live in its atmosphere.

The clouds of sulfuric acid above Venus could — at least hypothetically — be a haven for photosynthesis. No alien algae or other photosynthetic organisms have actually been found there yet, but biochemist Rakesh Mogul of California State Polytechnic University recently led a study, published in Astrobiology, about how this could happen. What is poison for one life-form could make it possible for another to survive.

Venus is a place where even spacecraft fear to tread. Every lander that has touched the radiation-blasted surface has met an untimely death. Far above that surface, its skies might have some hidden advantages for hypothetical phototrophs, organisms that use light as an energy source to power up their metabolisms.

“We found that several packets of wavelengths, which pass through Venus’ atmosphere, overlap with the absorption properties of many terrestrial photosynthetic pigments,” he tells SYFY WIRE. “The light that remains in the clouds represents the groups of wavelengths available for photosynthesis.”

Phycocyanin, which gives cyanobacteria (aka blue-green algae) its unearthly blue color, could possibly thrive in the Venusian clouds, since it can absorb the wavelengths of light that come through. These wavelengths are similar to those that can be absorbed by photosynthetic organisms on Earth. (Some people swear by it as a supplement. No, really.) So could bacteriochlorophyll b, which offers an assist to organisms that photosynthesize wavelengths of light that most plants and cyanobacteria cannot use. These phototropic bacteria do not release oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis.

Searching for extraterrestrial life means recognizing substances and processes close to those on our planet while also being prepared to find life as we don’t know it or don’t usually recognize it. After light scatters through Earth’s atmosphere, what is available for photosynthesis remains on the surface as opposed to the leftovers lingering in the clouds of Venus. However, heat from the infernal surface of Venus rises up to the atmosphere. Both that and heat in the atmosphere itself include photons whose wavelengths are an asset to some photosynthetic pigments.

While that might sound conducive to something like algae or phytoplankton thriving, how could they make it in noxious clouds of sulfur dioxide that are constantly irradiated by the Sun?

“The clouds in Venus have substantial abundances of sulfur dioxide and other unidentified chemical species that absorb and scatter UV and visible radiation, scrubbing the atmosphere of most of the harmful UV rays,” Mogul says.

What results from this is ammonium bisulfate and other neutralized forms of sulfuric acid that were observed to show higher water activity than what was previously assumed. This is because of molecular properties that have certain effects on water molecules. Sulfuric acid is something of a double agent before it is neutralized, because while it reacts with H2O, it also sticks to it, making less water available for living things. Ammonium bisulfate, which is also less acidic, doesn’t stick nearly as well, freeing up that water for other types of chemical reactions.

So much for the clouds of Venus being supposedly too dry and acidic to support anything that would need water to stay alive.

Even more amazing is that photosynthesis could even be possible at night on Venus. It already happens in environments with hardly any light on Earth, such as hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean. The photon fluxes on Venus were found to be much higher than those on Earth. Meaning, heat and light do not scatter and vanish as quickly in the gases of the Venusian atmosphere as they do in water. Light energy in thermal or infrared forms, possibly both, rises from the surface and is retained in the clouds. Phototrophs would never want for photons.

“Venus’ surface is just so hot that a major amount of thermal radiation is given off, this makes the atmosphere hot,” Mogul says. “Together, the surface and atmosphere release photons of light due to the heat, which then rise into the clouds.”

Whether there are alien things swarming in the clouds of Venus is still unknown, but if something like that is ever discovered, the find shouldn’t be completely unexpected.",,[]
phycocyanin,phycocyanin issues,Taiyo wows at Vitafoods with special product prototypes,"Taiyo, the expert in health-promoting natural ingredients, introduced innovative concepts that generated great interest among visitors to Vitafoods Europe in Geneva.

The focus was on Taiyo's water-soluble ingredients such as Sunfiber, SunActive Mg and combination products like SunCurcumin. Additionally, Taiyo presented a blue Sunfiber, which consists of a combination with phycocyanin from the spirulina algae.

Other popular new products included power shot concepts based on prebiotic juice powders with Sunfiber, which were eagerly tasted by attendees, as well as prototypes of matcha pralines and Taiyo’s elderberry-based ElderMune gummies.

Taiyo presented more than 40 new product concepts at Vitafoods, based on seven different raw materials, including Guar bean fiber (PHGG), matcha, and elderberry. Highlights at the booth were its water-soluble ingredients – a range of Sunfiber blends with various additional health benefits, like blue Sunfiber: It consists of a combination from Sunfiber and the spirulina algae, which contains a lot of protein and is said to slow down ageing processes, and also strengthen the immune system .[1]​ Moringa Extract S, a standardised leaf powder with 10% glucomoringin, which has anti-inflammatory properties, also generated great interest. Whether presented as a capsule or tablet, visitors were excited by the variety of options available.

Another special offer at the Taiyo stand was vegan bolognese, made with Vegemeat, a granulated pea protein that is free from soy, gluten, additives and preservatives, and has a convincing, minced meat-like texture. It is particularly suitable for making dishes such as meat-free bolognese or lasagna and therfore appeals to the consumer group who follow a vegan or low-meat diet, or suffer from intolerances and therefore closely study ingredient lists. Thanks to the gentle manufacturing process, Vegemeat convinces with a low acrylamide value and is thus superior to many other legume-based meat alternatives.

Dr Stefan Siebrecht, Managing Director of Taiyo's German subsidiary, says: ""The trend towards organic products was really noticeable at the show. As consumers are increasingly questioning a product's ingredients and wanting natural and plant-based alternatives, manufacturers of end products are on the search for suitable solutions.""​

Another trend evident at Vitafoods was growing interest in functional confectionery. Delicious gummies with added health benefits, for example, are becoming increasingly popular among consumers. They can be easily adapted to the different needs of various consumer groups and are available as a healthy alternative to conventional fruit gums.

Taiyo has quickly responded to this trend and showcased its ElderMune gummies, which contain elderbery juice powder plus Sunfiber. These small berries positively impact immune health because they are rich in vitamins C and B, and contain essential oils and minerals. So-called anthocyanins – secondary plant substances – are not only responsible for the berry´s rich black-blue color but also protect the body's cells from free radicals. Heart and blood pressure also benefit from advantageous elderberries as they have anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects. They therefore provide a great alternative to cranberries in combating cystitis and kidney disease, and help thoroughly flush the excretory organs.[2]​

Does your dog hesitate to use the steps? Is he slow to get up in the morning? Does he have a noticeable limp? Joint pain and mobility are common conditions among aging dogs. As dogs get older, the cartilage between their bones and joints begins to wear away. This causes bones to rub against each other, which leads to pain and inflammation.

While aging is part of life, the good news is that there are dog joint supplements that you can give your pup to improve comfort and mobility. The right supplement with the right ingredients can have a notable impact on your dog's joint health.

Many joint supplements contain glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM, and omega-3 fish oils. All of these ingredients decrease inflammation in the joints while also increasing lubrication and joint health.

phycocyanin,phycocyanin issues,"Spirulina: Uses, Benefits, Side Effects, Dosage, Precautions","Spirulina is a blue-green algae from the genus Arthrospira (""arthro"" roughly meaning ""joint,"" and ""spira"" meaning ""spiral""). It's been used by the Aztecs in Mexico and people living in the Lake Chad area in Africa for centuries. Spirulina's usually cultivated from bodies of water like lakes or farmed in ponds.

Spirulina contains several nutrients, including fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, and K), fatty acids (DHA, EPA), beta carotene and minerals. It's also a source of protein, but it lacks high enough levels of some of the amino acids that your body needs to function at its best (unless you have a medical condition where you need to avoid specific amino acids, like phenylketonuria or ""PKU""). Since spirulina comes from bacteria (specifically ""cyanobacteria""), it may be considered a protein source for vegans.

It's also important to note that the B12 in spirulina is in a different form as ""pseudovitamin B12"" than the type typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs, especially if you follow a vegetarian or vegan way of eating, which can be low in B12. Lower levels of B12 are also found in adults over the age of 60. And why's B12 important? Because your body needs B12 to make red blood cells, it's also crucial for brain and nerve cell development. Not getting enough B12 can cause tiredness, memory loss, depression, and even different types of anemia.

This article takes a closer look at the potential uses of spirulina and the risks associated with its use.

Dietary supplements are not regulated in the United States, meaning the FDA does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement that has been tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn’t mean that they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about any potential interactions with other supplements or medications.

Uses of Spirulina

Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare provider, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD/RDN), or pharmacist. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease.



Spirulina has fat-soluble vitamins (like A, E, and K), beta carotene and minerals, protein, and phycocyanins (pigments that produce a blue color and have shown antioxidant effects). Phycocyanins have been used as a dye in many industries, including pharmacy, culinary, and even cosmetics.

Scientists have studied, but not necessarily proven, spirulina's impact on different areas of health, including but not limited to:

We'll explore what the science says about spirulina's effectiveness for these health outcomes.



Antioxidant capacity

According to a meta-analysis (a collection of research studies) of nine studies with a total of 415 people, spirulina increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The studies used anywhere from one to eight grams of spirulina per day, a pretty extensive range. Many of the studies had a relatively small number of people, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much. The strength of the effects was not earth-shattering and was generally more substantial when people took five grams of spirulina per day or more.

The conclusion? Getting antioxidants from the foods that we eat can help reduce some of the inflammation in our bodies. To amp up antioxidants in your diet, try including a variety of the most nutrient-dense foods that you can source and afford - and they don't have to be organic - like whole grains, fruit, and vegetables to help increase your body's antioxidant capacity and reduce inflammation in your body. Just don't rely on spirulina alone.

Blood pressure

Scientists did a meta-analysis (a collection of several research studies on a topic) of five randomized controlled trials that included 230 people to check spirulina's effects on blood pressure. The people in the different studies took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina a day. The lengths of the studies were anywhere from two to 12 weeks, and many of the studies were pretty small, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much.

When the data was pooled (put together) and analyzed from these studies, the scientists said that spirulina lowered systolic blood pressure by about 4.59 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure 7.02 millimeters of mercury. Systolic pressure (top number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. Diastolic pressure (bottom number) measures the pressure your arteries experience between each heartbeat. The biggest blood pressure-lowering in the studies was seen in people who had high blood pressure already.

The scientists also said more high-quality studies are needed before we can start recommending that everyone with high blood pressure needs to start eating spirulina.

Blood sugar control

Have you ever gotten a jittery feeling after eating sugary food? That usually means your blood sugar's spiking. And this situation can be dire for people coping with conditions like type I or type II diabetes, disordered eating including diabulimia, and more.

Over time, blood sugar spikes that are left uncontrolled can actually lead to damage to your body. Worst case, in certain conditions like diabetes, that can look like having to surgically remove parts of your body (amputation), heart attacks, kidney failure, or stroke, which can lead to paralysis of parts of your body. While spirulina really would not likely be able to correct severe damage from uncontrolled blood sugar over time by itself, it has lowered blood sugar levels in human studies. And why? It could be its protein and fiber content, or perhaps it is phycocyanin's ability to help with inflammation. Scientists are still figuring it out.

Fourteen studies with 510 people with metabolic syndrome–a collection of symptoms like high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (""good cholesterol""), and high waist circumference, which altogether can create more severe health problems–were included in a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on blood sugar and other outcomes. And a lot of those studies didn't have many people in them, meaning they had lower statistical power. People took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina per day. Blood sugar and insulin levels were reduced in some of the studies after taking specific amounts of spirulina. More high-quality studies are needed before healthcare providers can recommend spirulina for lowering blood sugar and insulin levels.

Generally, working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN), particularly a Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist (CDCES), can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. RDs/RDNs can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to avoid spikes in your blood sugar, which could help you feel better. Remember, managing blood sugar can be challenging, and you don't have to do it alone!

Cancer

Unfortunately, very few well-conducted human studies have looked at spirulina's effects on cancer. There've been several studies in test tube cells or in animals that aren't humans. However, more well-constructed studies looking at its effects on humans are needed.



Cholesterol levels

Scientists conducted a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on cholesterol levels that had seven controlled trials for a total of 522 total people. They found that spirulina reduced: total cholesterol (by 46.76 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)), low-density lipoprotein (LDL by 41.32 milligrams per deciliter), and triglycerides (by 44.23 milligrams per deciliter). It also increased the ""good"" cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL by 6.06 milligrams per deciliter). Again, why did spirulina do this? We're not sure, but scientists think it may be due to its nutritional profile (fiber, fatty acids like DHA and EPA), its antioxidant capacity, or a combination of these.



While healthcare providers cannot recommend spirulina for lowering your cholesterol, they can suggest working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) to help you explore your eating patterns, movement, and more. Registered dietitian nutritionists can help you build your toolkit and your capacity. Again, you're not alone!

Liver health

Spirulina has been studied for its effects on liver health in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the study was very small (only 13 people), so we can't draw any conclusions about spirulina for NAFLD until larger and better studies are done.

Metabolic syndrome

Scientists have studied spirulina's effects on metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome happens when you have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist (excess abdominal fat). Metabolic syndrome can wreak havoc with your health and increases your odds of heart attack, stroke, and type two diabetes. One of metabolic syndrome's main causes is thought to be obesity. Obesity, however, can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass.

One spirulina meta-analysis pulled together data from 18 studies. It suggested that spirulina could help lower high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, which are all parts of metabolic syndrome. It's important to note that while spirulina may impact these outcomes, the most essential issue would be working on your current way of eating, your movement (exercise), and other equally important issues like addressing your emotional health. Spirulina can't solve these serious issues.

Consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and perhaps one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. In addition, they can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to help you feel better. Sometimes it can be challenging to give yourself permission to ask for and accept help. But you've got this. And you don't have to go at it alone.

Obesity

In a meta-analysis of five studies, scientists looked at spirulina's effects on weight management in people coping with obesity. Spirulina did decrease weight in people with obesity by 4.55 pounds and in people who were overweight by 2.82 pounds. However, clinically speaking, this is not enough to make a solid recommendation for use of spirulina for obesity treatment.

As mentioned previously, it's important to note that obesity can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass. And BMI does not give the complete picture of an individual's well-being. Consider requesting a body composition test (for example, skin-fold measurements or a DEXA Body Composition scan) from your healthcare provider in addition to other parameters that they may measure.

As mentioned above, consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and, ideally, one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). CSOWM RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. They can help you build your toolkit and your capacity, and help you feel better. You've got this.



What Are the Side Effects of Spirulina?

An allergic reaction may be possible in those allergic to spirulina. Allergic reactions would include rash or swelling. Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience side effects and call your healthcare provider.



Common Side Effects

Spirulina is generally safe, but some people have reported the following with its use:

Allergy

Headache

Muscle pain

Sweating

Trouble sleeping



Severe Side Effects

While severe side effects from spirulina are rare, be aware that the following have occurred:

Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

(severe allergic reaction) Throat swelling

Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience severe side effects and call your healthcare provider.

Precautions

People with phenylketonuria (inability to process the amino acid phenylalanine) and individuals with other amino acid disorders, for example, classical homocystinuria (HCU), or maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), may need to avoid spirulina due to its high protein and thus amino acid content.



The safety of spirulina in pregnant or nursing people has not been established. Speak with your healthcare provider before using spirulina if you're pregnant, plan to get pregnant or if you're breastfeeding.

Please don't give children supplements–including spirulina–without discussing this with their pediatrician first.

Spirulina can sometimes be contaminated with things like lead or other heavy metals (it grows in lakes, after all) or even toxins.



Dosage: How Much Spirulina Should I Take?

Always speak with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement to ensure that the supplement and dosage are appropriate for your individual needs.



Manufacturer recommendations might vary. As a general guideline though, don't use more than what's listed on your product's label. There's no recommended ""effective"" dosage of spirulina. Avoid spirulina if you're allergic or sensitive to it or any of its ingredients. Studies have used from one to 10 grams a day for up to six months to 19 grams of spirulina a day for up two months, with a relatively good safety profile in people with different conditions.



Again, please do not give supplements to children without first discussing this with their pediatrician.

What Happens If I Take Too Much Spirulina?

An upper limit or recommended intake is lacking for spirulina. Taking upwards of 40 grams per day for an unknown period of time has been noted. If you believe that you've taken too much spirulina, contact your healthcare provider for information.



Interactions

Blood thinners: While there are only about 0.26 micrograms of vitamin K in each gram of spirulina, taking far larger amounts could theoretically impact the blood-thinning effects of some medicines like Jantoven (warfarin).

Immunomodulators: Little evidence exists to support avoiding the use of spirulina with immunosuppressive drugs or drugs that change the way that the immune system works (immunomodulators).

It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included. Please review this supplement label with your healthcare provider to discuss any potential interactions with foods, other supplements, and medications.



How to Store Spirulina

Store spirulina in a cool, dry place. Keep spirulina away from direct sunlight. Discard as indicated by the ""use by"" date on the packaging. Keep away from children and pets.



Similar Supplements

Chlorella (a green algae supplement) is somewhat similar to spirulina.

Frequently Asked Questions Is spirulina the same as chlorella? No, chlorella and spirulina are different species of algae, but they're both supplements.

What antioxidants does spirulina have? Spirulina has phycocyanins.

If I'm a vegan, can I get all my protein and B12 needs from spirulina? While spirulina has most of the amino acids that your body needs, it doesn't have enough of some of them. Try to eat a balanced, varied diet to meet your unique protein needs. The B12 in spirulina–pseudovitamin B12–is in a different form than the type that's typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs.

Sources of Spirulina & What to Look For

Blue-green algae species used in spirulina supplements are typically Spirulina maxima, Spirulina platensis, or Aphanizomenon flos-aquae.



Just because a remedy is thought to be ""natural"" does not mean that it is safe. Some ""wild-crafted"" spirulina products may have been grown in water contaminated with heavy metals (mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium) or other pollutants. Opt for supplements produced in labs and certified by third-party authorities like the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF International.



As with all supplements, it's essential to talk with your healthcare provider before using spirulina to decide if it's right for you.

Who fancies some blue food? Really?

The theory of food colour confusion may originate from us being strongly aroused by foods on the red spectrum. Research published in Nature recently showed that we are more attracted to red coloured foods as they appear to signal better nutrition with higher calories in comparison to blue or green foods. Trichromatic vision evolved in humans as a response to improve foraging and may explain why we rely more on sight than scent when locating the most nutritious foods and fruits that are ripe and ready to eat. This is surprising to us as ‘leafy green’ farmers when we readily assume a green colour relates to health but the Nature study was more assigned to calorific colour arousal. Although our brains may not easily accept the blue colour as natural, our bodies will probably thank us if we do as blue-green algae also known as cyanobacteria has some of the best health benefits. Superfoods: Yogurt with blue Spirulina, Scottish Damsens, Blueberries and Sloes.

One particular cyanobacteria has been studied extensively over the years

Spirulina grows naturally in alkaline waters and was recognised and farmed by ancient civilisations for its medicinal qualities. The Aztecs of Mexico have a long historical relationship with Spirulina. They farmed Spirulina in large lakes, then harvested and air dried the algae to form a hard edible ‘cake’. This was often mixed with other foods and used as an energy source as these ancient people recognised it as an important functional food.

Massive health benefits that many people have still to discover

People who move beyond the colour tend to use blue-green algae for supercharging the immune system, controlling muscle spasms, detoxing heavy metals, eliminating candida, improving memory and increasing energy levels to improve exercise performance. It may also lower cholesterol and blood sugar, acting to prevent heart disease, heal wounds and improve digestion. Pretty impressive qualities for this single celled life form billions of years old.

There are two main species of the blue green algae Spirulina, Arthrospira platensis and Arthrospira maxima. As the image demonstrates, they are made up of single cells containing chlorophyll filled vesicles that react to light and photosynthesize like plants. Cultivation of commercial algae usually starts the life cycle in lab culture tubes, doubling quickly under controlled conditions. This helps to eliminate contaminants. Spirulina is the largest single celled blue green algae and it forms spirals visible to the human eye which bunch together to allow a quick harvest and is now cultivated worldwide as a nutritional supplement.

Spirulina is high in iron, calcium, magnesium, copper, beta-carotene and B-vitamins.

Apart from the high content of protein, Spirulina contains B vitamins, particularly B12 and provitamin A (β-carotenes), and minerals, especially iron. It is also rich in phenolic acids, tocopherols and γ-linolenic acid. Spirulina does not have a cellulose cell wall so it is more easily digested. Most people selling dried Spirulina suggest 1-8g per day to boost the immune system but be careful as too much can have negative effects so it’s best to start with the lowest dose.

Some suggest Spirulina has the power to tackle world wide problems like malnutrition. The UN and WHO recommend Spirulina for it’s extremely high nutritional value and sustainability. It has even been called the ‘world’s most sustainable food’ with the potential to end world hunger. The Pole Pole Foundation in the Congo were finalists in the Earthshot Prize recently. They are leading the way to teach communities in developing countries how to grow Spirulina as a supplement to prevent childhood malnutrition.

Could Spirulina be an alternative vegan protein source?

Would you drink blue milk? Many vegans are looking for alternative sources of protein. Spirulina might even be a protein source of the future and a substitute for cow’s milk. Spirulina platensis stands out for being one of the richest protein sources of microbial origin having similar protein levels when compared to meat and soybeans. Not to be confused with regular green Spirulina in its basic form, blue Spirulina is an extract of the active ingredient phycocyanin in its purest form. This concentrates the dried extract with higher levels of antioxidants without so much of the fishy taste of fresh Spirulina. But if you don’t mind using fresh Spirulina (it’s fishy so it’s much better to mix with stronger flavours) it will provide protein that is quickly and easily absorbed in the body compared to animal proteins which is a bonus as it contains many essential amino acids that the body cannot synthesize alone and are essential for tissue renewal.

Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory

Fresh Spirulina is high in antioxidants, especially phycocyanin, the pigment which causes the blue green colour. Phycocyanin can promote blood cell regeneration, improve lymphocyte activity and improve the lymphatic system. Studies have shown this antioxidant scavenges and fights the free radicals that cause oxidative damage.

Spirulina is known to be alkalizing to the body which boosts beneficial microflora in the gut. Liver function is improved and this greatly increases detoxification levels in the body. Fresh Spirulina contains chlorophyll and phycocyanin both of which help to remove toxins such as heavy metals and other pollutants from the blood. One remarkable study in children who lived close to Chernobyl after the nuclear disaster in 1986 found that giving them a small 5g dose of Spirulina a day could reduce radionuclide rates by half in less than two months.

Spirulina has Cancer fighting benefits

Spirulina has been hailed as an anticancer superfood, but reading further into peer reviewed literature is important as there are some extrapolated and conflicting reports from doing a simple google search. So here we only present peer reviewed data. From our research low dose Spirulina has anti-proliferation effects on stomach cancer cells, human leukaemia cells and B lymphoma cells, inhibiting carcinogenesis.

Eating Spirulina daily may lead to increased energy levels

Fresh Spirulina is particularly good for energy owing to its high nutrient density. Since the algae has no cell wall to break down, digestion of all those nutrients is fast and efficient. It can make a difference to energy levels quickly after consumption. Fresh Spirulina contains constituents such as polysaccharides (Rhamnose and Glycogen) and essential fats that are absorbed easily by cells and theoretically aid energy release. More studies are needed to be truly conclusive though but with low toxicity levels in the body, it’s well worth your own trials.

Spirulina enhances energy performance because it unlocks sugar from our cells. If you are suffering from memory loss, this bacteria added daily to your routine appears to have significant effects. It does this by protecting the brain from free-radical damage by increasing the activity of two enzymes: catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which fight free radicals and make the brain more resistant to aging.

But It’s not all good news

Spirulina may exacerbate autoimmune reactions in some people who are susceptible. As such it may worsen symptoms of multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions linked to overactive immune systems. It’s also not recommended for pregnant women or children or people on blood thinners like warfarin. Be cautious where you purchase Spirulina, as it may be contaminated if not bought from a quality source, leading to additional side effects.

Bioavailability: Should it be dried or is live culture better?

Image credit: Ecoduna, Austria If you search for Spirulina online you are mainly going to encounter powdered products. There is nothing wrong with these as most research was conducted on using powdered forms which still showed positive results. However some reports suggest fresh Spirulina has up to 95% bioavailability. This means that 95% of the nutrients including essential amino acids, all the B vitamins and antioxidants are absorbed straight into your bloodstream increasing potency by 45% compared with powder.

How difficult is it to cultivate and commercialize?

Spirulina cultivation requires sufficient aeration, agitation and proper light intensity for enhanced biomass yield, cell productivity, specific growth rate and protein content. Biomass yield has the potential to reach up to 12g/l biomass in a closed reactor system. Urea seems to be a promising alternative source of low-cost nitrogen for Spirulina cultures and addition of mechanised aeration will significantly increase yields. Spirulina vats in a hothouse, Mexico

But what about algal blooms? Are they the same Cyanobacteria?

Spirulina itself is non toxic but other forms of blue green algae including Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, grown and harvested in the wild, is often contaminated and leads to toxic conditions when out of control.

Blue-green algae occurs naturally in lochs, ponds, reservoirs, rivers and the sea. This summer in Scotland it became a real issue. When the conditions are right, blue green algae will create massive blooms so large they can be captured by satellite imaging from space. Blooms are accelerated by leaching of fertilisers, with nitrogen and phosphorus runoff into the water course which becomes detrimental to other life forms by blocking oxygen and releasing toxic microcystins.

So it’s a logical step to grow these in a controlled environment and if market conditions continue to accelerate consumer demand for functional foods then growing these super algae in CEA could be highly profitable for farmers.

Image credit: Earthrise The largest US producer of Spirulina is based in California and they produce on an open 108 acre site, exporting to over 20 countries worldwide. There are disadvantages of open ponds as they do not reach high biomass productivity due to the difficulty of maintaining the optimum temperature and so they are restricted to tropical and subtropical regions. This is mitigated to some extent with large paddles constantly moving the ponds.

Despite this hefty competition, CEA could be the perfect vehicle for growing a crop that has incredible health properties, sequesters CO2 and can be grown in tubing to eliminate contamination. With LED lights and agitation, enhanced yields could be harvested year round.

This could be particularly useful between the shoulder winter months to increase profits and farm skills where wholesale prices have the potential to return profits of up to $15/Kg . A rough estimate of 12g/L biomass can be achieved with a photobioreactor system incorporating PPFD 166 μmol photons m−2 s−1 with potential doubling every 2-6 days depending on the algal species chosen. Based on this, and assuming you harvest 50% at each doubling time, a microfarm running 100L tanks could harvest 0.6Kg every 2 days, giving a total annual yield of 106.2Kg and a potential maximum annual return of $1593. Scaling up production will make more economic sense. Optimizing and automating additional technology (LED lighting, CO2 enhancement and state of the art infrastructure as seen with Algaennovation) may boost production but this must be carefully managed to balance a return on investment.

Learning and applying new ideas – food, fuel & carbon trap

Image courtesy of Energy Futures living laboratory project, Lille France We like to get people talking about the future diversity of CEA. This helps drive innovation and creates wider jobs and skills. At the same time we aim to help you better understand the science and health prospects of plants that could be grown in CEA. Of all the ideas out there, maybe our favourite is the idea of an algae curtain. Glow in the dark tubes of algae obscure prying eyes from your space while producing your own superfood or fuel. Could plants literally fuel plants in a completely carbon neutral circular economy? Biodiesel produced using algae contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and highly biodegradable. This could have potential in offsetting CEA energy outputs and algae fuel cells could make home farms more economically sustainable in the future. There are so many applications for algae, some are even using it to extract CO2 from brewing. Whatever reason you have for growing Spirulina and others (chlorella) there is no doubt about this being classed as a superfood.

Closer to home we like the way CEA farmers are looking to diversify their product range and kudos to On the Grow farms in Rockwall, Texas, growing spirulina alongside their microgreens. They grow in demijohn bottles adjusting the salinity to 2 and pH 10.5-11, harvesting and topping up fresh water every day. In order to maintain high pH and avoid fluctuations, high amounts of sodium bicarbonate must always be included in the culture medium to buffer the solution. The water needs aeration and temperature needs to be tightly regulated to 80F. LED lights will speed up production and your farm will literally bloom. Image credit: On The Grow Farms, Texas

Spirulina first rose to fame as a potential space food. Maybe in space our brains are altered by gravity to be more accepting of blue food. Or maybe we will discover a whole new superfood bacterial species on Mars or deep in the ocean. So who’s got a spare shelf in their vertical farm for this blue superfood and space age protein milk shake?

phycocyanin,phycocyanin issues,Sacrebleu! French brewers use algae to make blue beer,"ROUBAIX, France— A French brewer has started using algae with a naturally-occurring pigment to turn their beer blue.

The beer, with the brand name “Line”, is the result of a tie-up between a firm that wants to popularise the algae as a dietary supplement, and a nearby craft brewery that was looking for a way to make its beverages more distinctive.

The beer is selling well, said Sebastien Verbeke, an employee of Hoppy Urban Brew, which makes the drink. “It’s getting an enormous amount of interest and curiosity on the part of the public,” he said.

The blue tint comes from spirulina, an algae that is grown in basins by a company called Etika Spirulina in northern France. The component of the spirulina that gives the blue color, called phycocyanin, is then added to the beer during the brewing process.

Tasting a freshly produced bottle of the beer, brewery employee Mathilde Vanmansart described it as hoppy, light, and with fruity notes, while the only evidence of the added algae was the distinctive color.

Xavier Delannoy, whose farm provides the spirulina, said after several test batches, the brewery had found a blend that appealed to customers.

He said 1,500 bottles of the blue beer were sold between October and December last year, and the brewery is now preparing to ramp up production to meet demand. —Writing by Christian Lowe. Editing by Jane Merriman",,[]
