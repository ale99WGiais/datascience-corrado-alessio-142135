"On a Mission to Tackle Waste in the Beauty Industry, MOB Beauty Will Offer Fully Compostable Packaging by 2024","PALM SPRINGS, Calif., June 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- MOB Beauty, a sustainable makeup brand focused on pro-quality makeup and innovative Earth-friendly packaging, has announced their commitment to offer NewPurpose, a collection of fully compostable beauty packaging, by 2024.

Dedicated to continuous innovation and with sights set on compostable end-of-life solutions, the team at MOB has dedicated three years of work and countless iterations developing NewPurpose.

The collection, which is the first of its kind, will include MOB's signature refillable Lip Capsule and Compact in a sleek design made with fully compostable molded fiber - a combination of natural Bamboo and Bagasse and 100% PCR cardboard coated in Verdecoat, a protective spray used in the food industry for added durability and water resistance, and Flaxstic, a plant-based bio-plastic made from a combination of flax shive and corn and wheat starches.

NewPurpose was developed in partnership with leading beauty packaging suppliers Golden Arrow, Albea and Montrose-Haeuser, alongside industry newcomer Pela – creator of Lomi, an innovative kitchen appliance that quickly breaks down organic waste into nutrient-rich compost. With this initiative, MOB is officially recognized as a Lomi Approved partner and NewPurpose is authorized as fully compatible for use with the device. The collaboration signifies what will be the first of many efforts to have a meaningful impact on waste from beauty packaging.

""MOB took on compostable packaging knowing what we were up against. From design to functionality, we held ourselves to the highest standards - hundreds of development hours, testing many iterations and costly tooling. This level of investment in both time and money for a young brand in today's fast-to-market environment is unheard of, but we're Earth-First and we mean it."" - Victor Casale, MOB Co-founder and CEO

Driven by a mission to make a global impact on beauty waste by rethinking packaging, MOB launched in 2021 with RePurpose, the first series in their Earth First packaging system that includes refillable Capsules, Compacts and Palettes made with at least 50% PCR mono-material PET or PP, the most recyclable plastics currently available, and outer packaging made with 100% PCR materials.

MOB's dedication to sustainability in beauty reaches far beyond packaging development as a foun ding partner of Pact, a nonprofit collective of beauty brands, retailers and suppliers. Launched in 2021 in partnership with Credo and Hudson's Bay, Pact is committed to taking responsibility for the industry's packaging problem through recycling solutions, education and shared resources.

In celebration of plastic-free July and as the next phase in development, beginning July 1 MOB will be offering a sneak peek of this new collection by including preliminary samples of NewPurpose Lip Capsules and Compacts with every mobbeauty.com order. Consumers will be surveyed for their feedback in effort to ensure an optimal experience when the collection officially launches.

Wrapping it up: Catch up on the world of cosmetics packaging,"Packaging is what turns a formula into a product, and it's what's left over the product is gone. That means cosmetic packaging is under the microscope as brands and suppliers try to become more sustainable.

CosmeticsDesign has investigated sustainability accreditation, packaging types and brand innovation. While packaging suppliers meet for an industry trade show, catch up on what's happening in the world of cosmetic packaging.

rePurpose wants beauty brands to think about plastic beyond the recycling bin

Plastic packaging is important in the beauty industry and rePurpose Global wants to create impactful accountability for plastic waste made by personal care brands.

According to rePurpose, 91% of plastic waste doesn’t make it to recycling and ends up in the environment. Svanika Balasubramanian, CEO and co-founder of rePurpose Global, told CosmeticsDesign a major contributor to plastic in the environment is where the plastic in the recycling bin ends up.

Balasubramanian said rePurpose found that roughly 75% of plastic recycled in countries like the US, Canada, the UK and Ireland ends up in countries like India, Indonesia and Vietnam.

“These countries, unfortunately, don't have the necessary infrastructure to deal with their own domestic waste, let alone be this one giant garbage dump for the rest of the world,”​ Balasubramanian said. “That's why we're seeing so much of the waste leaking into nature.”​

RePurpose Global acts as a private industry partner to address the end of the plastic recycling supply chain and works with brands to become “plastic neutral”​ certified. Because plastic is still an important packaging material in CBG, around half of the companies rePurpose works with are personal care brands.

Sustainable packaging roundup: What to keep in mind when choosing non-virgin plastic packaging

More sustainable packaging is on the cosmetics industry agenda, and there are a number of options on the market today.

What qualifies as sustainable varies from market to market, company to company and consumer to consumer, but one of the main goals is to decrease or remove virgin plastic in a beauty brand's packaging.

But, when moving away from virgin plastic packaging, brands have to consider material performance, ease of decoration, transportation costs and logistics, as well as the social and environmental impacts that other materials may have.

Packaging suppliers and sustainability consultants advise companies to do a holistic analysis of how they need packaging to perform, how the benefits and drawbacks of a given supply chain fit into their sustainability goals and what else can be done to improve packaging sustainability, like changing product format or reducing the amount of packaging used.

Below are stories on the four predominant types of non-virgin plastic integrated into the market today.

Refill revolution: Trestique brings refillable, one-stop makeup routine to promote repeat buys

Consumers are less likely to purchase full makeup routines from a single brand, unlike in skin care, but Trestique believes they can change that with strategic plans. © Trestique

Customer loyalty in color cosmetics can be elusive, but a makeup brand built around crayons and sticks has converted to a refillable model to give consumers a reason to come back.

Color cosmetics brand Trestique, based out of New York City, started six years ago built on the concept of a full makeup routine of stick and crayon-format products. Co-founder and co-CEO Jack Bensason said the idea behind the brand was to create a simple, single-brand makeup routine.

While it is common in the skin care market for consumers to purchase a whole routine under a single brand umbrella, Bensason said consumers were significantly less likely to do the same thing with makeup because retailers and brands were more likely to advertise their newest or trendiest product.

“Unlike many other brands, we’re not built around one hero product,” Bensason said. “In makeup, the customer behavior is very different because … the brand never gave them a reason to buy all the products under one roof. Our hero product is basically the makeup routine.”

In order to make that routine successful, Trestique developed a customizable makeup routine, based on what products a consumer wanted and their coloring, which can fit entirely in one small bag.

Prill power: P&G files patent for dissolvable hair care pouches

The personal care major filed an international patent for water-soluble pouches containing dissolvable hair care pellets for a user-friendly, sustainable alternative to bottled and solid formats.

Article by Kacey Culliney​

Personal care major Procter & Gamble (P&G) has developed water-soluble pouches containing dissolvable hair care pellets for a user-friendly, sustainable alternative to existing bottled and solid formats.

Writing in its international patent, P&G said the water-soluble pouches were made from fibrous sheets and could contain one or several types of personal care pellets/prills that dissolved into a creamy product when in contact with hot water. Designed to fit in the palm of a user’s hand, the pouches had been designed to contain prill blends for shampooing and/or conditioning of the hair.

P&G said the invention offered a sustainable alternative to liquid shampoo and conditioner products that contained “significant bulk” with extra water, preservatives and stabilisers, but also an alternative to solid format alternatives that were often associated with poor usability. Many bars or prills, the company said, did not dissolve fast enough on impact with water and others melted during shipping or storage, ahead of reaching the consumer.

“As such, there remains a need for an easy to use, solid personal care article that has a melt point greater than 45°C and rapidly disintegrates into a smooth, creamy, homogenous product upon hydration,”​ the company wrote in its patent filing.

Cosmetics brands performing well in shift to recycled plastic, require wholistic goals for real results

Plastic poses physical and chemical pollution challenges across the globe, and consumer brands make up a large portion of plastic which end up in the landfill. © Getty Images - ShantiHesse

Environmental solutions platform Ubuntoo recently released their 2021 report on corporate plastic packaging goals, with three cosmetics companies or cosmetics-owning multinationals among the best performing.

CosmeticsDesign spoke with Ubuntoo​ Operations Manager Haley Randolph about what the report​ means for the personal care industry.

Can you tell me a little bit about what this report found in regards to plastic packaging?​

We found roughly four categories of goals. Companies were largely creating goals around recycled content, virgin plastic production, collection and recovery, and then recyclability. A lot of companies had recyclability goals that were largely near the Ellen MacArthur Foundation goals​. The highest-scoring companies in our report had maybe three or four of those goals.

What did you find with cosmetics and personal care specifically in mind?​

Two of our top 10 companies were cosmetic companies, so the cosmetic category did relatively well. They are, in our report, classified as high plastic users, and we noticed that high plastic users tended to have higher scores than others, maybe because of the pressure to do so, or maybe because they actually want to make a change.

What’s Entailed in Finding Sustainable Makeup and Cosmetics Packaging?,"Understanding what packaging is made from, potential impact of those materials, and finding the right materials has entailed a lot of vetting.

It means deep dives into package designers’ claims and searching for sustainable options that are available at scale and affordable.

Melanie Petschke, a former family nurse practicioner who launched Crunchi Cosmetics, watches for new offerings for smaller packaging components with limited or no sustainable alternatives to plastics.

“When we launched, we thought of toxicity exposure. Cosmetics and skincare products are a hot bed for ingredients linked to cancer, hormone disruption, and other health risks with little to no regulation to ensure their safety. We chose ingredients carefully to avoid these concerns. But we also wanted packaging that would not contaminate the environment through leaching of BPA, BPS, or other toxins,” says Petschke.

While BPA and BPS are banned in many countries, there are no guarantees that material sourced internationally contains none of these chemical substances, still found in some plastic.

An early focus was to incorporate glass containers for liquid foundation and makeup primers – even lip gloss and mascara is in glass now. One downside to glass packaging is increased package weight, so the Crunchi team keeps an eye out for plastic-free, lighter alternatives and uses aluminum and plant-based packaging components with some products.

Some skin and makeup products are sold in post-consumer recycled paper that’s completely recyclable. For paperboard packaging for compacts, it’s meant no longer including mirrors to ensure the material can go in curbside bins.

“We will not launch a product unless we have a way to place it in sustainable packaging. We have put products on hold because we could not justify doing this work [aiming to protect people and the environment] if we have to use plastic—even if it’s post-consumer or recyclable,” Petschke says.

Vetting what’s out there can be tricky. She exemplifies with an eyeliner she wanted to produce in a wooden pencil where she got to the final stage of product formulation, then got a surprise.

“We discovered sharpenable pencil packaging in the U.S. may look like wood and feel like wood but is actually a plastic material. So, we pulled the plug. We ended up starting over with an alternative (aluminum) packaging, at greater than 10 times the cost. A worthwhile investment.”

There’s been other trial and error and tweaking along the way. For instance, the company used to wrap individual products in paper imprinted with information about clean beauty. But in time more filler paper was needed in the shippers to prevent glass breakage during transit. So Crunchi is switching to unit cartons, replacing the educational wrap to allow less fill.

The issue of material availability, particularly with some recycled content, namely glass, can pose challenges.

“We talked to companies who can supply some recycled glass, though presently it’s not offered at large enough scale. But post-consumer glass is on our radar. For now, we look for plastic-free and hope people recycle glass when they are finished with the product so ultimately, we will be able to access more of it,” Petschke says.

Determining how to best package an SPF product has taken some work; glass containers are hardly ideal for poolside. But Crunchi is making headway on this task, having found an alternative for the sunscreen and other lines that involves aluminum.

Samples remain a quandary. Petschke has only found one company offering what it calls a paper-lined with water-repellant material that can go into curbside recycling systems. She’s fact checking the designer’s claims, cautious of greenwashing.

Vetting is ongoing, including around compostability and degradability claims. Crunchi has a plant-based package for finishing powder that Petschke is happy with and she talks of similar promising innovations. But she has no data to confirm it breaks down in the required time to make the assertion.

“We know it’s biodegradable and compostable. We just can’t make the claims without proof of timeframe. We just stick to the term, plastic-free,” she says.

Crunchi also does due diligence around PFAS and is guarded around this topic too. The company invests in third-party laboratory PFAS testing of its packaging and goods to screen for contamination from the manufacturing process. But Petschke says while she is pleased with test findings, current PFAS testing capabilities have limits.

“Crunchi is committed to continued prevention strategies on our part … Unfortunately, this topic is ignored by many packaging and ingredient suppliers, and until there is legislation to hold manufacturers accountable for declaring everything in their products, including PFAS, this will be an ongoing issue for the cosmetic industry.”

Avoiding polymers in many of the smaller components, like mascara wands and caps, remains a work-in-progress, though she has found a way to make brush handles from 99.9% post-consumer aluminum.

With the wands, Petschke encourages customers to donate them to a wildlife nonprofit, Wands for Life, that repurposes them. Still there are no ways to divert and use some components.

“Even if you can take them apart and recycle them municipalities may not have capacity to do it. So, our immediate solution was to partner with CleanHub to sponsor removal of plastic from the environment at a greater capacity than we put it in [to offset our footprint]. Their projects stop plastic from going into the ocean, and they are creating jobs, which is pretty cool,” she says.

To date, CleanHub has diverted 1,190 tons of plastic waste, collecting most near shorelines, from rivers, or oceans.

The company’s biggest challenge is educating the masses that plastic pollution can be addressed successfully, says Joel Tasche, founder and CEO of CleanHub.

“Out of our partners, it is Crunchi with whom we have reached the widest audience. They have a unique distribution strategy and leverage it to raise awareness for our cause.

Their credo, ‘Earth Day is every day,’ sends a powerful message about what they stand for, and the value match with CleanHub makes our partnership a success,” he says.

Speaking of what drives that ‘credo’ Petschke comments, “We wanted to use sustainable, clean packaging for our health and the health of the planet.”",,[],[]
This $26 Concealer Is Innovation at Its Finest,"As POPSUGAR editors, we independently select and write about stuff we love and think you'll like too. If you buy a product we have recommended, we may receive affiliate commission, which in turn supports our work.

The Dominique Cosmetics Wide Awake Full Coverage Concealer offers medium to full coverage in 17 shades.

The formula comes with a cooling doe-tip applicator to depuff the undereye area.

One editor tried the concealer and was impressed with the results.

Concealers can be pretty hit or miss for me. I have dark undereye circles, but the issue stems from a lack of volume, not necessarily hyperpigmentation. Therefore, my journey to brighter, more ""wide-awake""-looking eyes means I'm often searching for a product that addresses both skin concerns, which is surprisingly hard to find.

Because of this fact, I'm willing to try any and every concealer on the market, no matter the formula — cream, liquid, mousse — or price. So when influencer Mikayla Nogueira raved about a concealer that had a metal doe-foot applicator tip, I immediately knew I had to try it.

The concealer in question is the Dominique Cosmetics Wide Awake Full Coverage Concealer ($26). It is available in 17 shades, which could definitely use expanding, but promises a radiant finish and medium to full coverage. As someone who loves the dewy-skin look, I couldn't open the packaging fast enough.

The concealer came housed in a normal plastic tube, but as Nogueira mentioned, the applicator is the star of the show. Like others on the market, it has a doe-foot shape. Unlike others on the market, it's not your normal fuzzy-tip applicator that absorbs product before you smear it on. Instead, it has a metal tip that feels cold to the touch, and I could see that the product was sitting on the applicator, which means you won't waste any product during application.

I chose the colors Honey Roast and Chai Latte and started with the former under my entire eye area. The applicator felt fantastic against my skin — if it wasn't for the simple fact that I would be applying entirely too much product to my face, I would have just sat there rubbing concealer under my eyes for minutes. (This probably would have been OK had I not doused it with pigment, since cold compresses can help depuff the skin, but alas.) Still, I reeled it in and applied the amount of coverage I would with any other concealer. Application took some getting used to, and I had to use both sides of the applicator to get as much product as I needed, but other than for a slightly awkward turn of my hand, the concealer applied smoothly and evenly.

Blending it out, I did get that medium coverage that the brand mentioned, but I knew I wanted the area to look brighter, so I also went in with Chai Latte to build up the coverage. This combination gave me the look I was going for and also covered up the darkness without looking cakey or piled on. While the concealer didn't address the lack of volume under my eyes, the cooling effect of the metal applicator did make them look temporarily refreshed. If you suffer from the opposite problem (puffy undereyes), then the cooling applicator will do wonders for you when applying your makeup.

I also noticed some very light texture appear after the formula dried down. While this isn't a dealbreaker for me, if you experience fine lines or slight texture of the skin under your eyes, you may want to set it with a lightweight blurring powder.

Did this concealer change my life? No, but it got the job done and my undereyes looked brighter, which in turn made me look well-rested. Now if I ever have a hard time falling asleep, I'll know exactly which product to reach for in the morning.

Seeds of Colour Co-Founder Anna Valle on Turning Waste into Want,"How would you explain the biotechnology process that you use for your formulas?

Sustainability lies at the heart of Seeds of Colour ethos, and this has been reflected in the process design from its conception. A color extraction method, protected by trade secrets, has been developed for numerous organic fruits and vegetables including, amongst others, blackcurrants, raspberries, strawberries, and beetroot. The biotech extraction methodology utilizes low temperatures to preserve the integrity of the pigments and co-extracted antioxidant materials. Post-extraction materials are either recycled or reused. For example, unused fruit juice is concentrated and heated to produce a caramel for use as a brown pigment. The residual pomace is converted into fertilizer by means of thermophilic aerobic digestion. This is why we talk about zero waste when we describe our brand—nothing nasty is left behind.

The formulations are just one part of the brand’s sustainable efforts, as each balm is packaged in a fully recyclable aluminum tube, with a recyclable plastic lid and contained in fully recyclable cardboard. These innovative, versatile Natural Colour Balms are just as good for your skin as they are for your world.

What extracts do you use for which shades?

Suitable to use across the lips, eyelids, and cheeks, the Natural Colour Balm’s signature eco-pigment has been forged from some of the finest naturally active ingredients. The extracts include beetroot, blackcurrant, blueberry, coconut, paprika, and sunflower. Different blends of these naturally active ingredients have been used to make versatile balm shades that suit all skin tones, whilst also being good for your skin. Boasting a whole host of skincare benefits, these antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hydrating balms harness the power of nature, empowering people to express their natural beauty.

We have four shades, and each of them has a blend of rich-botanical ingredients and different fruits and vegetables for the color pigment. For our Red Berry we used beetroot extract to create a vibrant mulberry hue. True Nude contains blackcurrant and rosemary extract to illuminate your skin tone. In the Rose Pink we used beetroot and rosemary to reach a warm dusky rose shade. Finally, to create the Warm Caramel, we used caramel, blackcurrant, and rosemary to develop a buttery blush hue for a sun-kissed natural warmth.

In the past, consumers have struggled with the different product performance of natural makeup versus their industrial counterparts. What do you think is the key to changing expectations and outcomes in regards to this?

Our innovative technology to extract pigments from fresh products was a game changer. It combines the benefits derived from food supplementation with the advantages of cosmetic treatments to improve the beauty of our body. Food chemistry and cosmetic chemistry come together to promote both inside and outside well-being. A vegan, plant-based makeup optimizes the intake of nutritional microelements to meet the needs of the skin and skin appendages, improving their conditions and delaying aging, thus helping to protect the skin from the aging action of environmental factors. The future of beauty is natural, even L'Oréal claims it, but for Seeds of Colour the future is now!

How did you create the biodegradable sample capsules and are there any challenges regarding their use, e.g., premature biodegrading of the material once it comes in touch with the product?

The biodegradable vegan eco-capsules we use are the same as those that are used for nutritional supplements. The products are stable within them for as long as we need them; the only thing is that they mustn’t get wet or else the capsule dissolves! There is no water on our products, they are oil based.

What innovations and upcoming developments are you most excited by?

The existing color range for lip and cheek tints will be extended from 4 to 12. This will be based on the existing base formulae and range of ingredients—blackcurrant, red radish, paprika, and beetroot. An additional novel lip and cheek range will be developed, where titanium dioxide is replaced by kaolin as a whitener/opacifier to satisfy the demand for products that do not contain titanium dioxide, like our Red Berry balm.

The basic lip and cheek ranges above may be enhanced further by the addition of new bioactive ingredients currently being developed as described below to create “pigment-plus” versions. We will keep simplifying the INCI bringing in, for example, oils with higher skin performance, perhaps aimed at certain skin types. Look out for the next generation of color balms with a more minimalist nature, yet still packed with goodness for the skin.

We will also keep driving our sustainability journey to increase our positive impact on all fronts. Seeds of Colour is a B Corp–pending company and a campaigner for the Better Business Act.",,[],['Carla Seipp']
Why Upcycled Beauty Is The Next Big Thing In Sustainability,"There’s a revolution coming to beauty, and it’s not exactly the buzzwords that have been slapped onto product labels for the past several years like “clean” or “green.” Meet upcycled beauty, (sometimes called by-product beauty), which is a method of making new products by using ingredients left over from other processes both inside and outside of the beauty industry. This operation primarily takes food that would be otherwise thrown away and left in a landfill and gives it another life as a product ingredient within skin care and more. Sure it may sound... unpleasant, but upcycled beauty actually has real potential for substantial positive environmental impact. This isn’t just a wacky marketing trend but a creative response to a real climate problem.

And while many people might focus on sustainability issues like packaging, there is real potential for upcycling to be the next major green wave in the beauty industry. “1.2 billion cosmetic packages are produced globally each year. The vast majority of the 1.2 billion cosmetic packages that are produced globally each year end up in in landfills,” says CEO and co-founder of PYT Beauty Mary Schulman, which is why much of the focus within “green” beauty has been aimed at initiatives like plastic-free packaging, but food waste has a comparable negative effect on the environment and should not be ignored.

Iryna Veklich/ Getty Images

“Eight percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions come from food loss and waste, which is why reducing food waste is considered the single greatest solution to climate change according to Project Drawdown,"" says sustainability advisor and United Nations consultant Thania Peck.

Reducing food waste by upcycling it into a beauty product has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And it’s not just food scraps — upcycled ingredients can be anything from leftover pulp from making juice to byproducts from gin distillation. The best part is that these ingredients are not any less effective, nor any less safe for the consumer.

How Does Upcycled Beauty Work?

Brands can source their ingredients from companies like UpCycle Beauty, which sells plant-based byproduct ingredients that are ideal for upcycling into new products. The brand sees the process as “an opportunity to create new products using minimal energy, whilst reducing our footprint,” according to UpCycle Beauty’s mission statement. Other brands maintain relationships with regional businesses and source from them, like UpCircle Beauty, which partners with local coffee shops to source coffee grounds.

“We intercept ingredients from other industries when they have already been ‘used’ for whatever purpose by that industry,” says CEO and co-founder of UpCircle Beauty Anna Brightman. “The ingredients we upcycle, [like] brewed coffee grounds still have fantastic skin care benefits after their initial ‘use,’ so we step in and give them new life as UpCircle products.” For brands that want to use coffee in their products, using new coffee beans and the resources that the process takes — solar energy, harvesting, roasting, and transporting the beans (and possible carbon emissions) — upcycling minimizes the resources used while offering a final product that is still high quality.

As with anything new in beauty there are some pioneering brands worth following and trying. Though some upcycled brands may choose to charge a luxury premium, others have prices comparable to non-upcycled ones.

Curious to try out an upcycled beauty product for yourself? Ahead, six leading upcycled brands to know and shop.

We at TZR only include products that have been independently selected by our editors. We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.

UpCircle Beauty

This brand champions upcycled coffee in many of its skin care products, from oil for face products to grounds that are great for exfoliation. To source coffee grounds, for example, the United Kingdom-based brand partners with local coffee shops to use leftover ingredients.

UpCircle’s Eye Cream with Hyaluronic Acid & Coffee is a lightweight formula that uses coffee oil and maple bark extract to soothe the skin, refresh it, and minimize the appearance of fine lines. Its bestselling Face Moisturizer with Vitamin E, on the other hand, uses upcycled argan shell powder, a by-product of the argan oil industry, and cocoa butter for a nutrient-rich and skin-protecting formula.

Bloomeffects

This Amsterdam-based brand was founded by Kim van Haaster in 2019, who found inspiration after moving across the Atlantic with her partner — who’s a fourth generation royal tulip farmer. At the time, she was a curious beauty executive who wanted to know more about tulips. After discovering their magic, royal tulips inspired her skin care line.

Using flowers from the family farm, Bloomeffects products harness the magic of the only flower that can still grow after being cut. Tulip cells are specially responsive to auxin, a plant hormone that's crucial to cellular growth and regeneration. The brand has amassed awards for a handful of products, like the Royal Tulip Cleansing Jelly that breezily dissolves oils and makeup from skin without stripping moisture and the Royal Tulip Moisturizing Nectar, a skin barrier-protecting hydrator with a honey-like consistency.

But it’s the Black Tulip line that uses upcycled petals for luxurious products like the Black Tulip Overnight Retinoid Serum and Black Tulip Eye Treatment.

Loli

Hippocrates said, “Let food be thy medicine.” Loli, which stands for Living Organic Loving Ingredients, lets upcycled food be the core of thy beauty product ingredients. “When you blend food to make beauty, you make more of yourself,” Loli founder Tina Hedges writes on the Loli website. “It’s powerful alchemy.”

Loli products are quickly becoming cult-favorites, but perhaps none compare to the Plum Elixir, which uses plum kernel oil, pomegranate, and tea seed oil to hydrate dry skin, hair, and lips. Made with upcycled food-grade oils, this product is great for sealing in moisture day and night. Loli’s Aloe Blueberry Jelly is another must-have to help douse the skin with powerful antioxidant protection and deeply hydrate. It’s perfect for those that don't like heavy creams, and is basically a soothing juice for skin to drink.

Farmacy

David Chung, Founder and CEO of Farmacy, always had the intention to create a purposeful skin care business, one that made customers feel good while contributing to communities through partnerships. The skin care brand, for example, partners with Feeding America to make donations for every product purchased. Farmacy continues to make announcements regarding its commitment to sustainability, including using nearly 1,500 pounds of upcycled food in 2021 that would have otherwise ended up in landfills.

Farmacy’s Waterless Vitamin C Serum is a silky, lightweight serum that uses upcycled tangerine peel and sugar beet. It easily absorbs into the skin while brightening and smoothing the skin’s texture. Harnessing its antioxidant-procured powers, the Niacinamide Night Mask uses blueberry seed oil for a thoroughly hydrating evening moisturizer.

St. Rose

Upcycled beauty doesn’t have to be limited to skin care. Fragrance ingredients can be upcycled, too. Australian brand St. Rose makes luxurious, gender-neutral fragrances formulated with the intention to ""inspire a deeper connection with mind, body, soul and Earth,"" according to its About page.

A couple of St. Rose’s fine fragrances use upcycled ingredients, like Grand Larceny. This rich scent captures the signature essence of a fresh rose by using upcycled concentrate layered with Egyptian geranium and sandalwood notes. Vigilante, on the other hand, is a bold and sensual scent that uses upcycled cedarwood atlas and upcycled rose concentrate.

BYBI

BYBI is a U.K. brand that describes itself as pro-planet beauty. All products are vegan, and many of them use upcycled ingredients leftover from the juicing industry. The Glowcurrant Booster, for example, uses white willow bark from a farm in Herefordshire, United Kingdom that was originally planted to encourage biodiversity and support insect populations. Now, it's in their brightening serum, which promotes more hydrated skin and a smoother complexion. BYBI’s Blueberry Booster uses leftover blueberry seeds from leftover juicing to create an antioxidant-rich facial oil that boosts skin health and moisture levels.

Everyday Humans

Global plastic waste on track to triple by 2060,"By Becky Bargh

7-Jun-2022

Findings show that the majority of plastic waste will come from short-lived items, such as beauty products

The world’s plastic problem is set to get worse before it gets better, a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revealed.

By 2060, the amount of plastic waste circulating across the globe will more than triple.

Polystyrene-munching superworms could hold key to plastic upcycling,"Scientists at Australia’s University of Queensland have now discovered that superworms — the larvae of Zophobas morio darkling beetles — are able to dine on polystyrene, and their gut enzymes could hold the key to higher recycling rates.

Chris Rinke, who led a study that was published last week in the journal Microbial Genomics [1], told AFP previous reports had shown that tiny waxworms and mealworms (which are also beetle larvae) had a good track record when it came to eating plastic, ""so we hypothesized that the much larger superworms can eat even more.""

Superworms can grow up to two inches (five centimeters) and are bred as a food source for reptiles and birds, or even for humans in countries such as Thailand and Mexico. Rinke and his team fed superworms different diets over a three week period, with some given polystyrene foam, commonly known as styrofoam, some bran, and others not fed at all.

Metagenomics

""We confirmed that superworms can survive on a sole polystyrene diet, and even gain a small amount of weight — compared to a starvation control group — which suggests that the worms can gain energy from eating polystyrene,"" he said.

Although the polystyrene-reared superworms completed their life cycle, becoming pupae and then fully developed adult beetles, tests revealed a loss of microbial diversity in their guts and potential pathogens. These findings suggested that while the bugs can survive on polystyrene, it is not a nutritious diet and impacts their health.

Next, the team used a technique called metagenomics to analyze the microbial gut community and find which gene-encoded enzymes were involved in degrading the plastic.

Bio-upcycling

One way to put the findings to use would be to provide superworms with food waste or agricultural bioproducts to consume alongside polystyrene. ""This could be a way to improve the health of the worms and to deal with the large amount of food waste in Western countries,"" said Rinke.

But while breeding more worms for this purpose is possible, he envisages another route: creating recycling plants that mimic what the larvae do, which is to first shred the plastic in their mouths then digest it through bacterial enzymes.

""Ultimately, we want to take the superworms out of the equation,"" he said, and he now plans more research aimed at finding the most efficient enzymes, then enhancing them further through enzyme engineering.

The breakdown products by these new generation enzymes could then be fed to other microbes to create high-value compounds, such as bioplastics, in what he hopes would become an economically viable ""upcycling"" approach.",,[],"['Meiyume Develops Exclusive Halal Sun Care Formulation For Carasun', 'Makeup Brushes', 'How To Go Even Further In Designing Eco Products Of Tomorrow']"
The top three beauty trends spotted at Cosmoprof Bologna 2022,"Sustainable beauty takes on multiple formats

Most of the key trends spotted amongst the finished beauty products at Cosmoprof Bologna this year are related to sustainable, eco-friendly and climate-conscious lifestyles. This mega-trend has been gathering pace during the pandemic and is growing stronger and more inclusive every year. As a result plastic-free and zero waste brand concepts were visible everywhere on the show floor, as were water-conscious products in various iterations. Let’s also note that vegan has become the norm for newcomer brands, especially those from the clean beauty and organic space.

Solid hair and body care formats have been dominating beauty launches in recent years. However, many of the new bath and body care solids presented at the show had little to do with the classic square shampoo or shower bars, as newcomer and indie brands are coming up with ever more sophisticated product formulae and designs.

Organic Korean beauty brand Urang Natural’s new Moringa Healthy Scalp Shampoo Bar, for example, has been formulated with soap noodles which help generate an extra creamy foam, and with moringa extract for scalp-conditioning. The ovoid shape of the solid shampoo is comfortable to grip with wet hands and its rough surface lathers up quickly. Similarly, the Lithuanian solid beauty brand Solidu Cosmetics uses processed plant oils as a base in its Thyme Body Butter (rather than the more commonly used shea butter or cocoa butter) so the easy-grip hexagonally-shaped body moisturizer melts quickly into the skin without leaving it sticky.

There was also a wave of solid face care launches at the show. Depending on their positioning, brands are marketing solid face care sticks as plastic-free/reduced packaging alternatives or as more convenient, fun and travel-friendly products. Korean beauty brand Cetena introduced several twist-up facial moisturizers including a Multi Balm formulated with avocado oil and macadamia oil. Fellow K-beauty brand Lovbod presented its new Dark Spots brightening stick formulated with soothing bisabolol and sweet almond oil to hydrate and lighten discoloured skin patches, while Canada’s Attitude launched several solid face and body care ranges, including an entire line of cardboard-packaged sun care sticks with mineral filters.

As dry products are much lighter, need less packaging and generate a lower CO2 footprint in terms of manufacturing and shipping, anhydrous beauty products - in the shape of tablets, powders or flakes - were also highly popular at the show. They also supply a fun DIY touch as they are designed to be reconstituted with water by the consumer at home.

Lebanese brand Beesline received one of the show’s Awards for its new Deodorizing Roll-On, a vegan deodorant tablet that turns into a liquid deodorant formula once dissolved in water. Organic beauty brand Ben & Anna from Germany, who originally started out with baking soda deodorants, has launched a compressed soap tablet available in two fragrance variants which can be used to create liquid hand soaps.

Zero-waste also continued to be a popular concept in both product packaging and ingredients/formulations, with more and more brands using upcycled or rescued food waste ingredients.

Vegan UK brand Upcircle Beauty was one of the first European body care brands to utilize food industry waste ingredients in its products - the company started out with bath and body care formulated with upcycled coffee grounds. Today Upcircle Beauty also uses other food waste by-products: the brand’s recent hand wash and body lotion duo launch contains upcycled bergamot and kiwi fruit waters. And fellow British indie brand Fruu Cosmetics formulates its 40-sku range of solid hair, skin and body care products with food industry wastes such as fruit skins, pulp, juices and extracts.

Transparency and regional pride fuel ingredient localism

Brands also continued to highlight key ingredients in their products especially when sourced locally, combining transparency in terms of ingredients sourcing with localism and a pride in regional/national heritage.

Swiss newcomer brand Chiara Zurich’s 6-sku face care range is based on glacier water which is sourced from the Titlis mountain near Lucerne where the brand’s founder comes from. Korean indie brand Sioris’ recently launched The Only One gel-textured facial essence, which is based on Korean bellflower extract. Similarly, Danish organic company Unique’s latest brand launch — vegan, gender-free face, body and hair care line Beauhe:it — contains a whole range of typically Scandinavian plant ingredients. Eventually, let’s mention Irish brand Green Angel’s new Hyaluronic Spheres Serum, which has been formulated with locally collected seaweed and algae extracts.

This sharpened focus on ingredients can be traced back to the functional beauty trend which was also playing a major role at the show. Many brands presented active ingredients in the shape of intensive serums and ampoules. Classic actives like hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, retinol or niacinamide were especially visible in the ranges of brands such as Turkey’s The Purest Solutions or UK’s Nature Spell. However, there were also a number of brands highlighting pro-biotics and ferments as their key functional active, like South African brand Esse’s Probiotic Serum.

Tech boosts customization

Personalisation continues to be a key source of innovation in beauty, in particular in categories such as face care. Cosmoprof Bologna 2022 featured a number of exhibitors showcasing different angles on product personalization. DIY concepts like active ingredients in serum/booster form to tweak beauty products or brands offering a neutral base cream plus suitable actives to customize a face cream are still popular. However, the advent of smart tech, digitalisation and DNA beauty is opening entirely new possibilities for consumers and brands alike.

Spanish brand Lesielle’s Adaptive Skin Care concept includes a small machine that mixes individual portions of skin care by combining actives with a base cream. Swiss beauty tech manufacturer Réduit received one of the Cosmoprof Awards for its new Booster, an AI-driven hand-held applicator for creams and lotions that promises more efficient ingredients delivery. Eventually, Genetica 23 from Italy offers personalized cosmetics based on DNA analysis, a detailed face scan analysis and comprehensive questionnaire.",,[],"['Meiyume Develops Exclusive Halal Sun Care Formulation For Carasun', 'Makeup Brushes', 'How To Go Even Further In Designing Eco Products Of Tomorrow']"
Burt's Bees x rePurpose Global Announce Ocean Plastic Prevention Initiative,"Burt's Bees will also invest in critical plastic recycling infrastructure in the United States and around the world in cooperation with The Recycling Partnership and rePurpose Global to recover and recycle at least as much plastic as their own plastic footprint.

Burt's Bees and rePurpose Global have announced a multi-year partnership to finance critical recycling infrastructure that prevents plastic waste from flowing into the ocean.

The initiative will support frontline waste enterprises in India and Ghana and promises to eliminate more than 1.5 million pounds of plastic waste otherwise bound for the ocean by the end of 2024.

In Kerala, India, it will enable recycling facility upgrades and sustained door-to-door waste collection services for around 2,000 households. In Accra, Ghana, the project will partner with buyback centers in the region and expand local collection networks.

Together, the initiatives will improve health and safety, working conditions and wellbeing standards for 350 local waste workers, the majority of whom are female, as well as create additional income streams from low-value waste materials.

Burt's Bees will also invest in critical plastic recycling infrastructure in the United States and around the world in cooperation with The Recycling Partnership and rePurpose Global to recover and recycle at least as much plastic as their own plastic footprint.

Matt Kopac, associate director of sustainability at Burt's Bees, said, ""Plastic waste is a huge challenge for our industry and the planet, and it demands true collaboration to tackle it. Not only does this partnership stop plastic from leaking into the ocean, but it also creates crucial opportunities to economically empower waste workers and their communities. We are very proud to join forces with rePurpose Global and support their thoughtful approach to tackling plastic pollution.""

Shellworks wants to crack makeup’s single-use plastic problem – TechCrunch,"Is the beauty industry ready to wean itself off single-use plastic? Shellworks is betting on it.

Targeting cosmetics brands, the London-based biotech startup has scooped up a $6.2 million seed round to prove it can scale its petroleum-free, compostable packaging, which “performs like plastic” but breaks down in about a year, the company claims.

Shellworks’ first plastic-like product was developed using shellfish waste, but less than a year into its existence the startup pivoted to using a fat-like substance extracted from bacterial cells, which “behaves like a natural polyester” and is vegan, according to co-founder and chief product officer Amir Afshar.

Like Fifth Harmony, Shellworks kept its name despite the lineup change.

“Our vision is to break the reliance on the petroleum industry by building a new standard of packaging that is performant, cost competitive and truly sustainable,” said CEO Insiya Jafferjee, who co-founded Shellworks after spending nearly three years at Apple.

So far, Shellworks has worked with beauty brands Bybi and Liha, as well as fragrance company Sana Jardin. Down the line, the startup says it may expand into other areas, including cleaning products.

Shellworks is one of the numerous companies busy developing alternatives to plastic packaging, without the nasty 500-year decay time that’s estimated for some petroleum products. Other such businesses include Notpla, which makes seaweed-based pouches for sauces, Avantium, which is developing sugar-based containers for soda and beer, and Cruz Foam, which turns shrimp shells into a Styrofoam alternative.

Packaging is to blame for roughly 70% of the beauty sector’s carbon emissions, per the British Beauty Council, an industry group.

London-based VC LocalGlobe, backer of firms like TweetDeck and TransferWise, led Shellworks’ seed round, which will go toward expanding the firm’s team. Other investors in the round include Cambridge-based seed investor Founder Collective as well as former Blue Bottle CEO Bryan Meehan.",,[],['Harri Weber']
"Global plastic waste on track to triple by 2060, but recycling could help","In the absence of bold new policies, the annual production of fossil-fuel-based plastics is set to top 1.2 billion tonnes by 2060 and waste to exceed one billion tonnes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Plastic production is expected to grow faster than the one of most raw materials. The growth will be fastest in developing and emerging countries in Africa and Asia, although the 38 OECD members will still produce much more plastic waste per person (238 kg per year on average) in 2060 than non-OECD countries (77 kg).

Even with aggressive action to cut demand and improve efficiencies, plastic production would almost double in less than 40 years, the international organisation projects. However, such globally coordinated policies could hugely boost the share of future plastic waste that is recycled, from 12 to 40 percent.

“If we want a world that is free of plastic pollution, in line with the ambitions of the United Nations Environment Assembly, we will need to take much more stringent and globally co-ordinated action,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said.

Alarm over plastics pollution

There is increasing international alarm over volume and omnipresence of plastics pollution, and its impact. Infiltrating the most remote and otherwise pristine regions of the planet, microplastics have been discovered inside fish in the deepest recesses of the ocean and locked inside Arctic ice. The debris is estimated to cause the deaths of more than a million seabirds and over 100,000 marine mammals each year. ""Plastic pollution is one of the great environmental challenges of the 21st century, causing wide-ranging damage to ecosystems and human health,"" Mathias Cormann added.

Since the 1950s, roughly 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic have been produced with more than 60 percent of that tossed into landfills, burned or dumped directly into rivers and oceans.

Some 460 million tonnes of plastics were used in 2019, twice as much as 20 years earlier. The amount of plastic waste has also nearly doubled, exceeding 350 million tonnes, with less than 10 percent of it recycled.

Coordinated policies could strongly increase recycling

The report contrasts a business-as-usual trajectory with the benefits of more ambitious global policies of reduced plastic use and pollution. Driven by economic growth and an expanding population, plastics production is set to increase under either scenario, the OECD warns. Where policies can make a huge difference is in the handling of waste.

The report looks at the impact of two potential scenarios. The first, a regional action scenario comprising a mix of fiscal and regulatory policies primarily in OECD countries could decrease plastic waste by almost a fifth and more than halve plastic leakage into the environment without a substantial impact on global GDP, which would be lower by 0.3% by 2060. The second, a global action scenario comprising more stringent policies implemented worldwide, could decrease plastic waste by a third and almost completely eliminate plastic leakage to the environment while lowering global GDP by an estimated 0.8%.

Currently, nearly 100 million tonnes of plastic waste is either mismanaged or allowed to leak into the environment. ""Co-ordinated and ambitious global efforts can almost eliminate plastic pollution by 2060,"" the report concludes.

According to the OECD, policies to reduce the environmental impacts of plastics and encourage a more circular use of them should include: taxes on plastics, including on plastic packaging; incentives to reuse and repair plastic items; targets for recycled content in new plastic products; extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes; improved waste management infrastructure; increased litter collection rates.

Earlier this year, the United Nations set in motion a process to develop an internationally binding treaty to limit plastic pollution.",,[],"['Meiyume Develops Exclusive Halal Sun Care Formulation For Carasun', 'Makeup Brushes', 'How To Go Even Further In Designing Eco Products Of Tomorrow']"

How Izzy is using a subscription model to close the sustainability loop,"Izzy is a prestige makeup brand with three hero products, mascara, gloss and brow gel, but what sets the brand apart is the complete supply chain overhaul they have designed, starting with a local supply chain and ending with consumers returning their used packaging.

Shannon Goldberg, the founder of Izzy and a 17-year veteran of the beauty industry, told CosmeticsDesign she was inspired to start the brand when she read an article stating that the cosmetics industry produces 200 billion pieces of non-recyclable plastic annually.

After reading that article, she said she wanted to learn everything about sustainability in the beauty industry.

“Sustainability is a word that really represents a wheel, and there are several spokes on that wheel,”​ Goldberg said. “Truly in beauty, you have the chance to pivot at every gateway of the product development process and make a more sustainable decision every step of the way.”​

With the help of digital consultant 1R, Goldberg build Izzy during the pandemic and launched a DTC subscription brand with a new take on sustainability.

How Izzy works

© Izzy Zero Waste Beauty

The concept of Izzy is all about reducing the brand’s carbon footprint, eliminating waste and closing the supply chain loop. Goldberg said that starts with shrinking the geographical length of the production process.

While many brands may have a formula from Europe, packaging from China and assembly in the US, Izzy works with local vendors to create a 400-mile supply chain which Goldberg said could be crossed with one tank of gas or two Tesla charges.

The brand also uses its subscription model to reach zero waste. Goldberg said one of her main concerns in creating the brand was to eliminate single-use plastics since most plastic used in makeup is too small to be recycled.

Her answer was stainless steel.

“We realized that the medical industry and nail industry put their stainless steel tools through a triple medical cleanse to remove all microbiome bacteria buildup,”​ Goldberg said. “But the most amazing point about stainless steel is that it can be washed and reused more than 10,000 times.”​

With the subscription model, a consumer buys one of Izzy’s products, which is primarily packaged in stainless steel with recyclable applicator parts, and in three months when the brand sends a new product, the consumer mails their used product back.

Once the used product gets back to Izzy, the stainless steel components are sterilized and reused and most of the applicator parts are melted down into their virgin form and used to create new applicators.

Goldberg said the only part of the packaging that can’t be reused or recycled by Izzy is the tip of the lipgloss applicator, which is donated by the brand to a company that makes cushions for children’s chairs in schools.

“She made it so simple,”​ said Shelly Socol, CEO of 1R. “I’m a 52-year-old executive, I want the ease of something that doesn't take a long time. (Goldberg) made something beautiful also easy, and I think that's a trend that we're going towards.”​

Positioning a brand for not just “tree huggers”

© Izzy Zero Waste Beauty

In the early stages of the company, Goldberg said she pitched the brand to a large retailer and was told only “tree huggers” and gen z customers would be interested in the concept. Over the past two years, she said it’s been a trial-and-error of developing the right positioning.

Izzy developed a pyramid of positioning priorities, starting with performance and efficacy. The brand’s key consumer, which Goldberg said is a 35 to 65-year-old executive or future retiree, does not want to trade down.

Next on the pyramid is the cleanness of ingredients because clean ingredients are nearly industry standard now, Goldberg said. At the base of the pyramid are the brand’s sustainability claims.

“We sort of always have to communicate in that hierarchy,”​ Goldberg said. “But at the end of the day, what we really wanted to communicate is we will do all the heavy lifting on the back end, we will make it easy for you.”​

In positioning, Socol said it’s important that products that make a consumer feel like they’re doing something good also are effective at helping them feel beautiful.

She also said companies with sustainability models like Izzy's, with a closed-loop and an expected return rate of 80-100%, are developing into somewhat of a foil to fast, high production companies across segments and grabbing the attention of consumers over multiple generations looking for more conscientious product options.

Goldberg said she doesn’t want Izzy’s model to be isolated to the brand. Even for brands whose front-facing characteristic is not sustainability, she said brands can successfully use a closed-loop subscription model to take control of their own supply chain.",,[],['Ravyn Cullor']

‘Recycling has to end’: Beauty industry needs to focus on reuse and refill to tackle packaging predicament,"The use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials and the implementation of recycling programmes are not helping the beauty industry curtail its output of packaging waste.

Instead, the CEOs of two circular beauty brands are urging the industry to explore solutions that focus on the other two Rs of sustainability – reducing and reusing.​

“In terms of the circularity hierarchy, we want to be looking at reducing, then reusing and recycling. I think there’s so much focus on recycling in beauty – it’s not the solution… ​I think when it comes to the discussion of circularity, there's too much focus on recycling versus actual reuse and refill and where I believe the beauty industry needs to go,”​ said Emma Lewisham, founder and CEO of Emma Lewisham.

“Definitely, refilling is the way to go. Fundamentally, people don't understand if you recycle something, there's a finite number of times you can recycle. Ultimately, you still have to get virgin materials and be depleting existing limited resources,”​ said Yeeli Lee, founder and CEO of Bhuman.

Both Lewisham and Lee were speaking at the recent CosmeticsDesign’s Circular Beauty – From Concept to Reality​ webinar (Now available to watch on-demand​).

“Packaging is the largest contributor to carbon emissions in the beauty industry. 120 billion units of packaging are produced annually, and a majority is predicted to go to landfill because despite brands promoting packaging is recyclable, the reality is that it's not being recycled,” ​said Lewisham.

As part of the Emma Lewisham Beauty Circle, the brand has set up a system which facilitates the return of empty refill pods, which would then be sterilised and refilled.

“We're not having to produce more and have this reliance on recycling. We need to take away this fixation on recycling and look at that reduce and reuse part of the agreement,” ​said Lewisham.

Among the multitude of reasons that hinder the recycling process, Lee highlighted that the infrastructure and processes differed from country to country.

“From day one as a brand, it’s really thinking about what are the systems and infrastructures in place? And if they don't exist, how do we go about still eliminating as much as possible the carbon footprint and the plastics that's in the material or in, in the product itself?”​

Bhuman, takes a different approach from Emma Lewisham, offering waterless personal care products which help the brand reduce its reliance on plastic and use easily recyclable aluminium bottles instead.

Furthermore, the removal of water from its formulation makes it easier to transport and lessens its water footprint.

“We're also talking about transportation being a huge carbon footprint of having materials being shipped from one place to the other, particularly when we're talking about expensive materials, such as eco-cert materials, or even ocean waste, plastics, all these if you look at it end-to-end, there's a lot of carbon footprint in the supply chain.”​",,[],['Amanda Lim']

Scientists Have Cemented A Solution For Food Waste — Literally,"Scientists Have Cemented A Solution For Food Waste — Literally

It can very easily be argued that food waste is a scourge of our society. The EPA reports that one-third of food produced in the U.S. ends up being thrown out, with 81% (20.3 tons) of household food waste ending up being buried or incinerated.

Aside from the fact that millions of American households struggle to put food on the table (USDA data shows), clogging up landfills and polluting the air by destroying unwanted food doesn't exactly seem to be an efficient process. According to WWF, food waste is believed to cause up to 8% of the human-made greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.

To try to reduce such extreme wastage and negative effects on the environment, experts have devised a cunning method of diverting unused food from the disposal. BBC Newsround reports that scientists have successfully converted excess food into cement that could be used to construct houses — but how did they manage it?",,[],['James Lewis']

How the beauty industry has impacted our oceans so far,"Water (aqua) tops the list of ingredients for almost all our beauty products. According to The International Natural and Organic Cosmetics Association, water comprises 60 to 85 percent of a cream formula, while rinse-off products may contain up to 95 percent. On top of this, the manufacturing processes used by the beauty and personal care industries often require thousands of litres of water. H2O, a precious resource to both humans and nature, is just as vital to our skincare rituals, and this is why the beauty industry—as a whole, and cosmetic brands both big and small—are making significant strides to innovate from a water-conscious perspective, through reformulations, ocean conservation, anti-pollution efforts, greener packaging, optimised manufacturing processes and environmentally friendly alternatives.

The problem with packaging

According to the Statista Consumer Market Outlook, the global cosmetics market’s revenue in 2021 was US$80.74 billion—and it’s slated to surpass US$100 billion by the end of this year. As optimistic as it all looks, another set of correlating numbers is that of beauty packaging, which sees more than 120 billion units of packaging produced every year globally. Unfortunately, most of these are not truly or fully recyclable—and the numbers are rising just as quickly—making the personal care and beauty industry one of the key contributors to the millions of tonnes of plastic waste that are dumped into our oceans annually.

“One of the biggest ways the beauty industry harms the ocean is through single-use plastic,” says Christine Tan, founder of Gentle Mood, a small-batch, handcrafted, artisanal soap brand. “Beauty brands have a strong focus on packaging when it comes to marketing their products, and this results in excessive plastic waste that ends up in landfills and the ocean. This is one of the main reasons why we are dedicated to reducing waste and not using any plastic packaging, even if it might cost us certain opportunities.” Besides containing little to no water in their formulas, bar soaps boast one of the eco-friendliest options when it comes to packaging, with many brands opting for paper wraps or boxes, versus plastic containers.

Over at industry stalwart, L’Oreal Paris, a major transformation is in motion to step up its international processes. The beauty conglomerate has spent the last 10 years reinventing the ways it does business, shifting its sights to more sustainable business models. And today, L’Oreal Paris has embarked on the second phase of its sustainability journey, presenting 2030 targets to preserve natural resources, control consumption and innovate new solutions in accordance with what our resource-constrained planet needs, all with the goal of cultivating a strong circular economy.

Statistics-wise, the company is targeting to have 95 percent of the ingredients in its products to be bio-based, derived from abundant minerals or from circular processes; 100 percent of plastic used for packaging to be either recycled or from bio-based sources; 100 percent of plastic packaging to be refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable; and 100 percent of waste generated to be recycled or reused—all to be reached within the next three to eight years.

Microplastics being a huge impact in the beauty industry

“However, it’s not just packaging itself,” adds Tan. “Cosmetics commonly include polymers such as polyethylene and dimethicone, which are microplastics that end up in the ocean; shower gels and shampoos include microbeads to help exfoliate, but microbeads are actually easily avoidable by choosing products with natural exfoliants such as coffee grounds or salt, which can be found in our Peppermint + Coffee and Pink Salt + Bergamot soap bars.”

No doubt, the prevalence of microplastics in the environment has become a major global conservation issue. And research has identified personal care and cosmetic products as a primary source. Despite being banned in certain regions, microbeads are still widely available for sale in certain markets, found in facial exfoliating formulas, shower gels, toothpastes, lip products and more. Realistically speaking, there are multiple loopholes in how microbeads have been phased out over the years, with big beauty players from Japan and South Korea to France and the US committing to eradicate these particles, but only from rinse-off products that exfoliate or cleanse, rather than all functions, which is how they’re still available in countless top-shelf formulas.

Isabel Aagaard, founder of LastObject, explains: “Microplastics are tiny particles of plastic that are a big threat to the environment and human health. One of the biggest sources of microplastics is the cosmetics industry, which has been purposefully adding tiny beads of plastic to a lot of products such as body wash, toothpaste and make-up for over 50 years. These microplastics get washed down the drain and are too small to be caught in filtration systems, so they end up in our oceans where they get ingested by marine species at the bottom of the food chain and are eventually consumed by humans. Microplastics often contain toxic substances such as phthalates and polychlorinated biphenyls, which have been linked to cancer and a range of other serious health conditions.”

The thing with these little capsules is that unlike other sources of environmental microplastics, they can be easily replaced by natural ingredients. According to Amore Pacific, microbead alternatives include mineral and plant-derived materials like silica and zeolites. Chanel uses exclusively natural beads such as jojoba; while at L’Oreal, they come in the form of powdered fruit kernels, mineral-based perlite or any other natural polymer.

As a sustainable brand, Sigi Skin is always finding ways to be more eco-conscious. Founder Xenia Wong explains: “We introduced our first refillable packaging for our Garden Party Deep Cleansing Clay Mask. This helps to reduce plastic waste and our carbon footprint greatly as the refills are much lighter. Also, our Bright Skies Peeling Gel Exfoliator instantly removes dead skin cells without any microbeads.”

One of the biggest sources of microplastics is the cosmetics industry, which has been purposefully adding tiny beads of plastic to a lot of products such as body wash, toothpaste and make-up for over 50 years.

Ocean-friendly alternatives

When asked if recycling or reducing was the more sustainable option, Aagaard affirms that “reducing consumption will always be the more sustainable option”. She adds: “It’s easy to focus only on disposal when considering the environmental impact of a product, but we should take into account the entire life cycle of a product to determine what the most sustainable choice is. By reducing and reusing, we also reduce the amount of energy, water and raw materials needed for manufacturing new products. Also, the CO2 emissions and other pollution caused by transportation are much lower.”

It is this mindset that led her to found LastObject, to create reusable beauty essentials that eliminate the need for disposable products, such as Q-tips, cotton rounds and menstrual pads. A single LastSwab, LastObject’s version of the reusable Q-tip, replaces up to 1,000 single-use swabs, “so by making the switch we can all do our bit to reduce plastic pollution in the oceans. We wanted to go a step further so we decided to use recycled ocean-bound plastic in our products. This way we are also cleaning up our oceans from existing plastic. So far, we have helped eliminate over three million single-use products.”

Besides alternative packaging and reusability, brands have also invested in formulas that do not harm the ocean and its inhabitants. Representing a new wave of beauty brands that seeks to make a positive impact on our skin and the planet, One Ocean Beauty offers a clinically proven clean skincare line formulated with sustainably sourced marine actives to smooth, firm and nourish complexions. “We do not harvest from the ocean. Instead, our marine ingredients are recreated sustainably in the lab,” says Kat Bryce, head of brand. One of its star products is the Replenishing Deep Sea Moisturizer, which is formulated with nutrient-rich wakame extract from an algae native to the Sea of Japan, and cryoprotective marine actives. “We also have a long-term partnership with Oceana [one of the world’s largest ocean activist charities] and have an ongoing campaign called Love Ocean, which helps to drive awareness and provide support for the protection and conservation of the world’s oceans,” she adds.

Sustainability’s constant evolution

Ultimately, the definition of sustainability is one that’s ever-evolving, surrounded by mounting challenges, misconceptions and easier-than-you-think alternatives.

Aagaard sums it up best: “There is nothing that is absolutely 100 percent zero footprint, and is also an ever-changing field. New materials are created that are better than before, new possibilities in manufacturing arise and new knowledge comes to the table. The key to becoming more sustainable is to keep innovating and keep searching for new possibilities—which also makes this one of the hardest challenges in sustainable beauty. There is no one answer or one truth about anything. You can create something and think this will be ever sustainable, but you can only create something to be the most sustainable right now with the notion and opinion you have now. This can change tomorrow. Which also makes it exciting and happy, to see the world is moving.”

JUNOCO Raises $6.3M For Microplastic-Free Vegan Beauty,"San Francisco-based beauty brand JUNOCO has raised $6.3 million in its Series A funding round. The round was led by Vision Plus Capital, with participation from FREES FUND.

The funding will be used to launch a wider range of simple products with ten or fewer ingredients, and also to make 80% of the brand’s packaging refillable.

JUNOCO was founded by serial entrepreneur Kyle Jiang. With his family involved in the global packaging industry, Jiang had grown up witnessing the waste and environmental issues associated with conventional beauty products. As a result, he wanted to develop more sustainable alternatives.

All JUNOCO products are cruelty-free, vegan, and free of microplastics. Additionally, all the brand’s packaging is recyclable and many of its formulas use upcycled ingredients. Currently, JUNOCO’s bestseller is its ten-ingredient cleansing balm, which has sold more than 500,000 units in its first year.

#ToBeHuman

This summer, JUNOCO will be launching a skin positivity campaign called #ToBeHuman. The aim of the campaign is to demonstrate that “true beauty is boundless” by showcasing real skin and bodies. It will seek to normalise features such as wrinkles, acne, and discolouration.

Sustainable vegan beauty

The market for vegan beauty is now worth $511 billion, and is expected to exceed $716 billion by 2025. Demand for vegan cosmetics has been described as “spiralling”, and companies are increasingly turning towards more sustainable initiatives such as refillable containers.

“People themselves are becoming more and more attentive and mindful of their consumption, and for many people vegan cosmetics are the way to make their everyday life more sustainable,” Nadine Steuer, founder of sustainable cosmetics brand Kupfergrün, told vegconomist.",,[],[]
New Brunswick-Owned Cosmetic Company Receives LGBTQ+ Owned Business Certification,"Reading Time: 3 minutes

Alicia Nicholson, the founder and CEO of Upfront Cosmetics, said owning a business was not the path she planned to take. She got the idea for the business when her first son was born and she was searching for a shampoo that didn’t irritate his scalp.

“I landed on the products that I have now and realized there was a market for them and here we are three years later,” Nicholson told Huddle in an interview.

Nicholson said receiving the LGBTQ+ owned business certification means having third-party verification that the business is owned by someone in the LGBTQ+ community.

“Growing up in a small, rural, New Brunswick community, it really meant a lot of the time I shied away from really expressing who I really was. So getting the certification, I hope that it can show other people that are maybe in my shoes that it’s okay. Don’t think that that’s going to be something that can hold you back and just that it’s okay to live your true self,” Nicholson said.

Nicholson said some larger companies have supplier diversity mandates where they must buy a certain amount of goods or services from minority-owned or diverse enterprises. Upfront Cosmetics having the LGBTQ+ owned business certification will allow them to compete against those larger companies.

The certification is offered through the CGLCC (Canada’s LGBT+ Chamber of Commerce). Nicholson said the organization helps all sorts of businesses not just with certification but also through resources or training.

“Maybe businesses aren’t necessarily owned by someone in the LGBTQ community but want to make sure that they’re inclusive,” she said.

Nicholson said receiving the certification is humbling because she now gets to operate Upfront Cosmetics in the same community she grew up in where she didn’t feel comfortable living her authentic self.

In celebration of receiving this certification and also for Pride Month, Upfront Cosmetics released a limited edition love is love bar. Nicholson said two dollars from each love is love shampoo bar will be donated to the Rainbow Road foundation.

“They are a global, not-for-profit foundation that help anyone in the LGBTQ+ community that’s facing prosecution based on their sexual orientation, sexual gender, or any of those things. It helps bring them to places like Canada or the U.S. where they’re not going to face that same kind of systematic.”

Her business, Upfront Cosmetics, is approaching its three-year anniversary in July. The natural-product business launched after Nicholson did a business accelerator through the Summer Institute program at the University of New Brunswick.

Upfront Cosmetics sells vegan, eco-friendly, paraben-, synthetic fragrance-, and sulphate-free shampoo and conditioner bars, as well as hair masks. Nicholson said each hair care bar replaces two-to-three bottles of liquid shampoo. The bars come with no plastic packaging and are made with all-natural ingredients.

“We’re at this interval time, just as a society, that if we don’t start doing something about plastic waste it’s going to be too late.”

Nicholson said she has found great natural alternatives but they all still come in plastic packaging.

“It was really just about finding something for [my son] and just my passion for environmental justice just went right along with that.”

Upfront Cosmetics has four full-time staff who make the products at a manufacturing facility in Nackawic.

While Upfront Cosmetics doesn’t have its own storefront, Nicholson said her products are sold at 650 different stores across Canada and the United States. Some of these stores include Sobeys, Safeway, Whole Foods Canada, and some independent health food stores.

Kao x istyle Leverage Sebum RNA Monitoring for Cosmetic Matching,"In spring 2022, Kao Corp. and istyle, which operates Japan's @cosme beauty website, announced a joint collaboration to build a database leveraging Kao's sebum RNA monitoring technology to collect data about users' skin (with consent) while also tracking their related product choices. The goal is to build a database of 10,000 individuals' skin types and cosmetic selections to improve matching between them, in turn enhancing customer satisfaction while helping to reduce waste from discarded products.

See archived: Kao Predicts 86 Changes in Skin with Age, Menstrual Cycle and More

According to Kao, while cosmetics are mass produced for a wide range of consumers, the technology for personalizing them has been evolving; although flooding the market with information and making it more difficult to find the right products. With Kao’s sebum RNA monitoring technology, an oil-blotting paper is used to collect sebum from the face, then the RNA in the sebum is extracted and comprehensively analyzed. Using the data of thousands of types of RNA obtained from this process, Kao has been studying how to group skin types with similar RNA expression (skin RNA type).

Kao, together with istyle, will then combine the data and research knowledge to improve the efficiency of product selection and customer satisfaction by better matching products to individual skin types. In the future, both companies plan to utilize the database for the development of services and products that enable users to search for cosmetics from a more objective perspective.

5 Eco-Friendly Beauty Habits You Need To Adopt RN,"The beauty industry alone around the world generates a lot of waste which is non-recyclable and causes harm to the environment. Tons of waste products in the form of plastic bottles of shampoo, other personal care products, tubes and containers of moisturisers etc. are thrown in the waste bins and later form a part of ocean waste. These are causing adverse effects on the flora and fauna of the oceans. Although taking charge of waste management is not in our control, we can try to imbibe a few environment-friendly beauty habits which can lead to limited generation of waste and do our part in contributing a little to keeping the environment clean.

5 Sustainable Beauty Habits Which Are Environment-Friendly

1. Choose Products Slowly

Research well before buying and investing in new products. Buying refills as replacements of used products is the best way to start a sustainable beauty routine. Whenever you tend to empty your beauty products, conduct proper research by buying samples or going to sample counters arranged by cosmetic brands and then buy the desirable full-size products.

2. Eco-Friendly Packaging

The cosmetic brands these days have become environment conscious and are having sustainable packaging options. Select the products that avoid plastic in particular and also bulky packing which is actually useless. Start using glass bottles, recycled paper boxes and reusable materials.

3. Ditch Wipes And Cotton Pads

Wipes and cotton pads are generally used for makeup removal and creates a lot of waste in general. Try avoiding the use of such wipes and instead opt for washable and reusable microfibre cloths which can solve the purpose and not create waste at the same time.

4. Avoid Disposable Beauty Products

Avoid the use of disposable razors, makeup brushes and applicators which are one time use products. Instead opt for stainless steel razors which have a long-lasting shelf life and wooden or bamboo-made makeup brushes which are easily recycled.

ADVERTISEMENT

5. Look For Natural Formulation

Natural formulations may not work for everyone as sometimes sensitive skin faces irritation and itching when applied with natural ingredients. However, if your natural ingredients work for your skin type, then opt for marine extracts, algae and organic ingredients instead of opting for chemicals.

You can try and use a combination of the above-mentioned methods to protect the environment. We advise you to consult your dermatologist before using a new skincare product.

States take new PFAS policy steps as waste industry awaits federal guidelines,"Listen to the article 9 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

As the waste industry awaits new federal guidance, states are developing regulations and laws on how to manage PFAS in everything from packaging to clothing to biosolids. The question for waste companies is how these decisions could affect daily facility operations down the line.

The U.S. EPA is not expected to develop standards for certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances until next year, but the waste industry has asked Congress to grant MSW landfills a narrow exemption from liability if certain PFAS eventually are designated as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA.

In May, the National Waste & Recycling Association and the Solid Waste Association of North America submitted a joint letter to the Senate environment and public works committee, arguing that CERCLA regulation could have unintended consequences, such as forcing landfills to restrict PFAS-containing waste; could raise the costs for managing the material; or could force landfills to pay litigation costs in PFAS-related lawsuits. MSW landfills are passive recipients of PFAS-containing items, and they do not otherwise manufacture or use PFAS, thus they should not have to be liable for PFAS contamination issues as they consider themselves “part of the long-term solution to managing these compounds,” the letter stated.

In the meantime, some of the recent, relevant PFAS management updates have come from states that are motivated to reduce residents’ exposure to the substances and take a more proactive approach to the chemicals, said Craig Butt, a PFAS scientist at SCIEX. “The states are not waiting for the federal government to make a decision. They're being more proactive, so we’re seeing more state-level decisions come online,” he said.

Recent PFAS actions that could impact the waste and recycling industry in the coming months and years include the following.

Addressing PFAS in packaging

Several state and local governments, along with environmental groups, have turned their focus to legislation that would phase PFAS out of consumer goods and food packaging. These bans or restrictions are meant to reduce everyday human exposure to the chemicals, but they could also have a long-term impact on landfills and the costs associated with managing PFAS at their facilities, said Lauren Tamboer, a communications consultant for the Washington State Department of Ecology.

“This is meant to be a benefit to waste streams because it reduces sources of contamination entering those waste streams,” she said. “It's just a more preventative approach. It's cheaper than cleaning it up in the environment once the chemicals have already been released.” The waste industry also favors this upstream focus.

Though it’s not clear exactly how big an impact these laws could have on the amount of PFAS entering disposal over time, PFAS-related rules could directly affect operations costs, said speakers at WasteExpo in May. At the conference, the Environmental Research & Education Foundation estimated that the incremental cost to treat PFAS within leachate could impact tip fees from 3% to 14%, based on a national $54-per-ton average, Waste360 reported.

Washington is one state working to phase out PFAS in packaging as part of a multiyear plan to address PFAS-containing products like apparel, firefighting gear and cosmetics under the state’s Safer Products Law. Gov. Jay Inslee recently signed HB 1694, which speeds up the timeline for the state's Department of Ecology to act on restricting numerous products containing PFAS.

Ecology last week also published the second part of its anticipated report identifying packaging alternatives that do not contain PFAS. The research is part of an ongoing process of banning specific types of food packaging containing PFAS once “safer alternatives” are identified. The process is also meant to avoid substituting packaging with what Tamboer calls a “regrettable alternative” that might contain a different type of chemical that could cause health concerns or disposal issues down the line.

Washington sees itself as having an aggressive timeline for its PFAS management plan, but Tamboer said other states will soon take up their own PFAS management laws that could be as strict or stricter. “These are emerging regulations. There will be a lot of restrictions moving forward, and I think guidance is going to get better and better,” she said.

In Colorado, the sale of many products containing intentionally added PFAS — including food packaging, carpet and products meant for children — will be prohibited starting in 2024 if Gov. Jared Polis signs HB22-1345. Cosmetics, indoor textile furnishings and indoor upholstered furniture with PFAS would be prohibited in 2025, and outdoor textile furnishings and outdoor upholstered furnishings with PFAS would be prohibited in 2027, according to the bill. U.S. PIRG, a supporter of the bill, sees Colorado’s actions as one step in a broader effort. Emily Rogers, a PIRG Zero Out Toxics advocate, anticipates other states will adopt such bills in the future to “turn off the tap on PFAS contamination across the country.""

As the general public learns more about PFAS and its potential health impacts, more companies are announcing voluntary phaseouts of PFAS in packaging. Starbucks announced it would eliminate PFAS in its U.S. packaging by the end of the year and eliminate it from its global packaging in 2023.

Both McDonald’s and Burger King had earlier pledged to remove PFAS from their packaging, but after a recent report from Consumer Reports found significant levels of PFAS in the restaurants’ packaging, both companies are facing lawsuits for alleged false advertising and deceptive business practices.



Packaging producers will need to keep a close eye on such lawsuits, Butt said, as the outcomes could shape state policies on what types of packaging can be sold into certain states or regulations on how PFAS from certain packaging should be managed down the line. Consumers also need to read company pledges carefully to determine exactly what companies are promising when they make PFAS-related claims, he added.

“Are they saying they will eliminate all PFAS, or just PFOA? The wording matters.""

Other state PFAS bills to watch

States are also working through legislation that would more strictly regulate PFAS in drinking water and soil or restrict disposal of certain types of PFAS:

Illinois: Lawmakers in Illinois have passed HB 4818 , a bill that would ban incineration of certain materials listed under the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory that contain PFAS, such as firefighting foam. The bill includes exemptions for the combustion of gases at landfills, medical waste incinerators and byproducts generated by municipal wastewater treatment facilities, according to state Sen. Christopher Belt, a sponsor of the bill, in a statement . The bill has been sent to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for his signature. Pritzker last year vetoed a similar bill, but this year’s version of the bill aims to clarify that incineration does not include the use of thermal oxidation for the purposes of pollution control, Belt said.

Maine: In April, Gov. Janet Mills signed a law prohibiting the land application of biosolids from a wastewater treatment plant and the sale of compost containing the biosolids because of concerns they contain PFAS. The new law could send more municipal biosolids, which are sometimes used as fertilizer, to landfills in Maine or surrounding states, causing logistical and capacity issues and further complicating landfills’ leachate treatment processes, panelists at WasteExpo said . Other states could consider their own similar bans, the speakers said.

said Florida: HB 1475 is awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signature. The bill requires the state's Department of Environmental Protection to adopt cleanup rules and targets for PFAS in drinking water, groundwater and soil in certain cases, focusing first on PFOA and PFOS. The rule goes into effect if the U.S. EPA does not finalize its standards for PFAS in drinking water, groundwater and soil by Jan. 1, 2025.

Recent EPA moves on PFAS

Though experts say the states are most likely to move quickly on new and updated PFAS laws and regulations, the U.S. EPA is also making decisions that could soon affect the industry.

Emily Lamond, an environmental attorney with law firm Cole Schotz, expects the EPA to stay on track with the targets it announced in its PFAS road map back in October, including its intent to publish more detailed data on PFAS disposal and destruction guidance by the end of this year and to update its guidance by 2023.

The EPA is still expected to designate certain PFAS as hazardous substances and set drinking water standards for certain PFAS sometime next year — two decisions many waste facility operators consider key for determining how they will need to measure, manage or dispose of PFAS-containing items in the future.

The EPA in May also announced it would add five PFAS to its regional screening and removal management levels, though Lamond said the designation likely won’t affect landfill operations unless they are already named in a Superfund case.

Last week, the EPA also awarded Virginia Tech $800,000 to develop a low-cost technique to measure hazardous air pollutants and contaminants such as PFAS. The study’s focus on finding cost-effective strategies aims to be accessible to underserved communities experiencing poor air quality, as part of the Biden administration’s efforts to address environmental justice concerns, the EPA said in a news release.",,[],['Megan Quinn']
Oysters reveal their benefits and enter into cosmetic formulations,"Oyster-based cosmetics? The idea may seem far-fetched, even if the cosmetics industry already use a bunch of unusual ingredients. Indeed, much like broccoli or onions, oysters offer many interesting benefits for the skin.

Brands interested in oysters use absolutely every part of it, from the flesh to the shell, claiming varied and diverse benefits, including anti-aging, purifying, remineralizing and cleansing for skin, hair and even dental health.

In powdered formulas

Natural cosmetics brand Perlucine (created by the Aquatonale Group) is one of the brands that has been embracing the virtues of the oyster, more precisely the shell of the white oyster. Harvested by hand on the beaches of Brittany, France, oyster shells are carefully cleaned before being made into powder to enrich the formulas of different products, from facial cleansing powder to body scrubs, artisanal soaps, shampoo powder and even powdered toothpaste. The range is Ecocert Cosmos certified.

Oyster extract

Meanwhile French brand Edulis has recently released a range of cosmetics formulated with the extracts of patented oyster oils encapsulated in clay, in order to take advantage of the mollusk’s unique properties all day long. Created at Cap Ferret, this innovative line is more interested in the properties of the European flat oyster from the Arcachon Basin, called Ostrea Edulis.

""We have extracted natural active elements that are nourishing and stimulating, for a firmer, fresher feel and an immediate tightening effect that’s safe for skin,"" explains the brand.

Currently Edulis has three products on offer — a serum, a day cream and a night cream — combining all the benefits of oyster extracts with those of ulva lactuca seaweed from Brittany, desert date palm oil, kokum butter and frankincense resin, all natural ingredients.

A champion in the world of upcycling

Not content with only attracting attention in the cosmetics industry, oysters can also be transformed into a number of materials in order to reduce waste — and to also take advantage of its numerous benefits. Through upcycling, they can be transformed into natural fertilizer and even descaling material for household appliances. The calcium carbonate from the shells can also be used as a basis for creating alternative sustainable materials.",,[],"['Meiyume Develops Exclusive Halal Sun Care Formulation For Carasun', 'Makeup Brushes', 'How To Go Even Further In Designing Eco Products Of Tomorrow']"
Axiology founder on focusing on hero SCUs to become plastic-free,"CosmeticsDesign spoke with brand founder Ericka Rodriguez about making the transition and the next steps for the brand.

To start out, tell me a little bit about your brand.

We're a vegan, cruelty-free and clean makeup brand. All of our products contain 10 ingredients or less and we recently transitioned to becoming a 100% plastic-free beauty brand. We're most well known for our zero waste balmies.

We're also palm oil-free, which is not easy to do, and people can understand what most of our ingredients are. They’re common ingredients like avocado oil, coconut oil and castor oil.

Tell me a little bit about the decision to scale back your SCUs.

I started this brand because I'm a lifetime animal welfare advocate. I stopped eating meat when I was 11 years old and I’ve really focused on animals my whole life. I was in my early 20s when I discovered that animal testing was still a thing in cosmetics and that horrified me. I thought that that was a thing of the past.

My brand started as a vegan brand. As the brand has slowly grown, I've maintained an interest in environmentalism. Recently, I heard that the beauty industry is responsible for 120 billion units of packaging waste every single year.

That really triggered me, especially when I was already feeling icky about all of the waste. We inevitably have to produce waste as a brand. That just kind of sealed the deal for me, I really don't want to be part of that anymore.

I still wanted to keep Axiology alive, I still wanted to offer a better, safer alternative to plastic. So we decided just to ditch plastic and become plastic-free.

Can you tell me a little bit more about what the ‘rose and thorn’ of making that transition was?

The hard part is finding manufacturers to help us. That's actually how we ended up creating our balmies because we were looking for manufacturers who could make a 100% recycled lipstick a few years ago. We couldn't find any manufacturers to do that.

The closest we got to our sustainability goal was lipstick tubes with 50% post-consumer recycled plastic that is not recycled after that. At the time, we thought we'd just do that for the lipsticks.

But we still were not meeting our goal of what we wanted to put out into the world. That's how we started developing our balmies. We just had to do it ourselves, without any manufacturers involved. Now it's on us to innovate and find the right partners or just do it ourselves.

Tell me a little bit about your kind of retail expansion into Ulta.

We launched the balmies in Ulta with 100 doors in October 2020. We recently expanded this month in May into 100 more doors with our balmies

What's the next step for your plastic-free transition and this focus on your hero SCUs?

We are working on plastic negative certification right now. We discontinued all of our lipstick tubes that are plastic and we are relaunching those in paper tubes this coming fall. Then we have a new product launching in early 2023 which will be in paper. This product is not traditionally in paper, so it should be pretty exciting.",,[],['Ravyn Cullor']

Wood-Based Tubes Support ‘Field-to-Face’ Beauty at Bloomeffects

The birth of tubes as easily squeezable and collapsible packages for dispensing products from paint to glue to cosmetics—and perhaps most notably, toothpaste—was recorded in 1841, when American artist John Goffe Rand invented a pliable metal tube to effectively hold paint. (HistoryofCosmetics.net; Wikipedia)Almost a half-century later, in 1889, Johnson & Johnson was the first major company to package toothpaste in a tube, when they introduced their first consumer product, Zonweiss, in a collapsible metal tube. Soon after, a Connecticut dentist started selling toothpaste in lead tubes in the 1890s.A metal shortage caused by World War II put an end to tubes made of tin and lead, and packaging producers moved to aluminum and plastic. Most toothpaste tubes have been made from sheets of plastic laminate, which is usually a combination of various plastics surrounding a thin layer of aluminum that works to protect the taste and formula of the product inside.Now, in this age of packaging sustainability consciousness and mandates , the mixed material composition of toothpaste tubes makes them difficult to recycle, and cosmetic industry suppliers and brands are again in the midst of finding new solutions.Tubes are increasingly available in an array of materials from plastics to aluminum to paper to sugarcane bioplastics; in sizes from minis to economy; shapes from round to oval (and beyond—read on); and topped with an array of cap styles.With their many benefits, including hygienic protection, ease of use, cost-effectiveness and decorative options, tubes have become the preferred packaging not only for many oral care products, but also for cosmetic items from eye shadow to lip balm to hair treatments.At the end of 2021, research from Future Market Insights (FMI) showed that the global cosmetic tubes market was expected to reach a valuation of $2.4 billion for the year. With rising demand for their use in makeup and skincare products, FMI predicted that the overall sales of cosmetic tubes would increase at 4.6% CAGR between 2021 and 2031.Cosmetic tubes offer various advantages over conventional packaging solutions, say FMI analysts. They are versatile, easy to use, lightweight, preserve moisture, and provide effective protection against contamination from various environmental factors. Most plastic tubes are considered safe as they do not interact with the contents within the tube. R&D success has also led to improved flexibility, decorative techniques and labeling—and new and advanced versions of materials from aluminum to paper.Manufacturers are now focusing on developing cosmetic tubes from recyclable and biodegradable materials, says FMI, with some of the leading cosmetic tubes manufacturers moving away from plastic use to recycled materials. Advanced decorating techniques are providing new visual interest to tubes as well—from vintage vibes to elegant renderings and bold hues.Tube suppliers we spoke with for this article report an uptick in production, and in many cases cite the on-shoring trend, which can ease certain supply chain difficulties. But growth in the tubes market has been ongoing. Viva has seen steady growth every year for the past decade, reports Melanie Gaudun, business development manager.Plastic squeeze tube production and decoration currently represent the larger part of second- and third-generation owned-and-operated JSN . Sandy Nagel, vice president, JSN, tells Beauty Packaging, “We are seeing modest but steady, consistent growth in our market. In addition, on-shoring continues to add to domestic manufacturing demand.” Nagel says that it’s not only Made in USA that sets them apart from their competitors, but that “the footprint of a whole package is advantaged because manufacture of tubes, decoration and closure can be accomplished timely and effectively in one location.”Growth with a few Covid-19 related blips and re-focuses were the case at Neopac , where Cornelia Schmid, marketing manager, told Beauty Packaging, “During the pandemic we saw stable growth, but travel retail and luxury cosmetics went down and there was a noticeable pivot toward less expensive brands. However, we saw increases in other areas, including sanitizers and medical brands.”Stephane Beauchemin, vice president of sales & marketing at Plastube , sums it up, saying, “The fact that tubes require less plastic than bottles for the same capacity during the manufacturing process will contribute to increase the demand for tubes.”As testimony to just how far tubes have progressed, we asked a number of leading tube suppliers in the cosmetic industry to tell us about their most recent launches, the latest trends they’re seeing in the industry, what brands are looking for—and ultimately, what consumers are demanding of their packaging in this space. Albéa provides plastic and laminate tubes, printing expertise, caps and applicators, and an extensive range of recycling-ready, paper-based, PCR and bio-based tubes.In 2020, L’Oréal and Albéa launched the “groundbreaking,” first paper-based cosmetic tubes designed to replace L’Oréal plastic cosmetic tubes in the midst of growing environmental concerns.In March of this year, LyondellBasell, Albéa Tubes and L’OCCITANE en Provence launched what they again called “groundbreaking” cosmetic tubes and caps for L’OCCITANE en Provence’s Almond range. Created to support the circular economy, the packaging is made by Albéa Tubes with CirculenRevive polymers from LyondellBasell.A member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Albéa manufactured the actual cosmetic tubes and caps for L’OCCITANE en Provence. Albéa has pledged to make all of its tubes recyclable by 2025, and increase the use of post-consumer recycled resins.L’OCCITANE en Provence, which has signed the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Global Commitment, has said they will “cultivate change” at every level, starting with the sustainable design and production of their packaging.Richard Roudeix, LyondellBasell senior vice president of Olefins and Polyolefins for Europe, Middle East, Africa and India, said, “We are excited to work with Albéa Tubes and L’OCCITANE en Provence on this project and to contribute to circular cosmetic packaging solutions. “Our CirculenRevive products, which are part of our Circulen product range of sustainable solutions, are polymers based on advanced (chemical) recycling technology from our supplier Plastic Energy who converts end-of-life plastic waste streams into pyrolysis oil feedstock.”Gilles Swyngedauw, VP of sustainability and innovation at Albéa Tubes, says, “The Almond Shower Scrub is the holy grail in terms of responsible packaging today. The tube and cap are designed for full recyclability and made of 93% recycled polyethylene (PE) content. On top, both are made of PE for higher-quality recycling, confirmed as recycling-ready by recycler associations in both Europe and the U.S. This packaging is in effect closing the loop, and that’s quite a breakthrough!”Many tube manufacturers also manufacture closures, for complete, seamless packages.Closure manufacture is a valuable asset at JSN , which began developing the Disc Top dispensing closure more than 40 years ago. Tube production began five years later. While the company now purchases tube closures “from the most reputable sources,” says Nagel, “we also produce in-house closures to complement our own tubes. This expedites special colors, special additives, and general lead-time responsiveness.” Another of JSN’s capabilities is the manufacture of custom closures—in proprietary designs, logos, and high-end nail polish closures. Conventional deco includes offset, silkscreen and hot-stamp.In tubes, JSN has been utilizing sustainable polyethylene resin from sugarcane for several years. “It is certainly our first recommended “go-to,” says Nagel, “and is readily accepted in the personal care industry. Sugarcane resin also has the great advantage of not hindering the decoration process.”Nagel says PCR is used routinely in dark colored personal care caps/closures. She explains, “PCR in a flexible tube package is more complicated due to the thin sidewalls and customer preference to avoid product contact with PCR layers. Commercially available PCR is continuing to improve, but color variation and imperfections are still a challenge. We are seeing complete redesign of some package art to accommodate [this].”Recently, JSN added production of plastic co-ex laminate tubes which allow greatly expanded decorative options on white and metallic substrates. In addition to expanded deco possibilities, this product also offers more effective inventory warehousing to permit shorter lead-time on final tube production—an attractive feature for some users, explains Nagel. Berry Global provides laminate and extruded tubes, plus matching closures, in a broad range of size styles and colors to provide the complete tube package. They offer a wide range of “brand differentiating, premium decoration options.”Vali Braselton, marketing manager, Consumer Products North America, Berry, tells Beauty Packaging, “Because there are many paths to sustainability, we offer our customers a variety of circular packaging options for tubes to help them meet their sustainability goals. Our size, scale and expertise translate into solutions that include recycled content, reduced carbon footprint, renewable material and improved recyclability.”Berry recently launched bio-resin polyethylene tubes made from HDPE sugarcane , and their single-substrate HDPE laminate tube with HDPE closure has been recognized by the APR. In addition, their laminate tubes are offered from “pellet to pallet.” This means Berry extrudes, forms, decorates and caps all tubes in their Evansville, IN facility, resulting in one of the “lowest carbon footprints in the industry,” according to Braselton.Berry recently introduced a low-profile tube, available with a matte or glossy cap, that reduces carbon footprint by using less material—specifically 24% less material in the cap and 16% less in the shoulder. The tube can be made with PCR, is made from 100% PE for improved recyclability and can be decorated just like any other laminate tube, says Braselton. Neopac manufactures PE, COEX and polyfoil tubes ranging from 10-50mm. Among other solutions, Schmid says “Our EcoDesign range comprises tubes that are lightweight and utilize recycled content or bio-based materials. In addition, Neopac has patented a recyclable mono-material-barrier tube, Polyfoil MMB, that was recently approved as recyclable by the U.S. Association of Plastic Recyclers.For specialty cosmetics, Neopac offers tubes with pumps, applicators and nozzles, and also child-resistant options for concentrates and cosmeceuticals. They also have a PE/PP cap in-house production for screw and flip-top caps.Neopac’s Stylo Pipette Tube, utilized by skincare company Filorga, incorporates an innovative pipette applicator allowing for dispensing of Filorga’s Skin-Unify radiance fluid directly onto the skin. The precision dispensing adds new levels of comfort and hygiene.The Stylo tube’s aesthetically appealing ring ensures correct discharge, and offers added product protection. An arrow pictogram helps consumers intuitively understand how to turn the ring. The cone-shaped cap safeguards the applicator, while Neopac’s polyfoil barrier laminate ensures ample formula protection.Overall, the tube’s premium look, eye-catching conical shape, transparent cap and enticing pipette applicator help Filorga’s Skin-Unify radiance fluid stand out in a crowded, competitive space.Viva specializes in manufacturing unique polypropylene (PP) tubes, applicators and caps, with in-mold label decoration. The company is vertically integrated, with tubes, closures and decoration all made under the same roof in Toronto, serving North and South America. Viva also has a production facility in Warsaw to serve the European market, and a plant in Hong Kong, where their design team works on new developments.According to Viva’s Gaudin, the company’s injection-molded tubes have a number of unique benefits, including a smooth, resilient profile that retains a round, wrinkle-free shape throughout its lifecycle; a mono-material design compatible with the rigid PP recycling stream per the APR Design Guide for Tube Recyclability; and highest content PCR, up to 90% in tube and cap combined.The beauty of in-mold label decoration, says Gaudun, is high definition, shoulder to crimp artwork with 360-degree coverage; and options for spot matte, spot gloss, foil effects and velvet soft touch finishes. Viva also designs their flip-top caps to be oriented with the customer’s artwork.One of the largest areas of growth at Viva is in tubes with PCR content. Viva can include up to 87% PCR in the tube (including sleeve, neck and shoulders) and 100% in the cap, for a combined total of 90% PCR, says Gaudin. Viva has seen steady growth every year for the past decade—and reports “extra growth” in their smallest diameter tubes (0.34 oz. to 0.75 oz.), tubes with applicators, and tubes with their highly tactile velvet soft touch finish.For more than 50 years, CTL-PACK has provided “the highest quality plastic tubes in the U.S. & European markets.” According to Andy Olsen, vice president, sales & marketing, they work with customers to develop high-end plastic tubes, premium decoration capabilities and continuous innovation for both extruded and injection molded round and elliptical plastic tubes. In the U.S., they manufacture injection molded PP in-mold-labeled tubes. According to Olsen, this technology “delivers superior decoration, improved supply chain performance (MOQ’s 5/m) and a winning sustainable package with a uniform all-PP package.”CTL PACK’s in-mold-label tubes deliver premium decoration using digital and flexography printing technology. “This allows for marketers to decorate on a flat substrate versus decorating the tube after the tube is made.” The company’s IML tubes are 100% polypropylene making them recyclable, and they can add PCR “to further the sustainability value.”Olsen says the company recently developed tubes that “showcase our ability to deliver serialization.” In this example, CTL printed 3 different images of Paris’s skyline. When placed together on the shelf, the 3 different decorated tubes produce a collage-like image. This ability can be applied to various patterns, colors, names or images to create a larger picture when viewed from a distance. Montebello offers both full aluminum tubes and laminate tubes. Steven MacPhail, vice president sales & marketing, says, “For the cosmetic industry, aluminum tubes offer the highest barrier property, and specialty head styles for controlled application as well as the vintage look.” Plastube has been manufacturing and decorating tubes aimed at the cosmetic, veterinary, pharmaceutical & food industries in North America since the start of the company in 1963. Beauchemin says Plastube “is the partner of choice for fillers and manufacturers of products packaged in tubes for small to medium size runs, and offers a multiple variety of decoration solutions including digital printing that delivers high-quality printing.”Plastube recently produced The Koyal Beauty Gentle Gel Face Wash 60ml. This is one of the first COEX-PCR tubes printed by Plastube using their digital printer, and Beauchemin says, “The result was astonishing!” Norden Machinery offers tube filling systems, cartoning and shipper box packing solutions for tubes. The portfolio ranges from speeds between 40-1,000 tubes/min. Ida Sigvardsson, marketing specialist, Norden Machinery, tells Beauty Packaging, “We work with customers using all kinds of tubes, plastic, laminates, metal and sustainable tubes.”Norden Machinery recently developed a paper-based tube, but it was not without challenges, due to the very low plastics content. “Still,” says Sigvardsson, “the pressure tests show that the laminate structure of the paper fiber separates before the sealing breaks. The customer needs to be able to trust that the tube has the same durability properties as an average tube. This was the challenge, and we managed to solve it with a good outcome.”As mentioned, the popularity of tubes is increasing due to their many benefits. Suppliers mentioned some of the chief advantages for brands and consumers.Tubes are fundamentally convenient and versatile, says Viva’s Gaudin. “To start with, they are highly portable, shower-friendly and travel-friendly. Most sizes fit nicely into the average person’s hand. It’s almost therapeutic to squeeze a tube.”Viva’s tube options include a wide variety of diameters, lengths, orifice sizes and applicator attachments, in sizes ranging from 0.34 oz. to 15.5 oz. Tubes can include barriers to support a wide range of formulations, with custom colors in the resin and in-mold label (IML) decoration to match any other existing packaging.In addition, says Gaudin, “Viva can design your tubes to meet the current requirements of the rigid PP recycling streams, and include up to 90% PCR in tube and cap combined. She cites a 2020 Life Cycle Analysis, in which Viva’s PP tubes show over 50% lower impacts in the top three categories that contribute to over 80% of the overall environmental impact of plastic tubes: global warming fine particulate matter formation, and human non-carcinogenic toxicity.At Neopac, Schmid, says among other benefits, tubes offer a superior “packaging to product” ratio compared to bottles. “They have attractive ‘good-to-empty’ rates for viscous products, creams and liquids. Tubes also offer a wide array of printing and decoration options, including various combinations of offset, silk-screen, flexo, digital printing and hot-stamping.In addition, Schmid says high-barrier tubes can provide “longer shelf life and exemplary protection against air, moisture or light.Montebello’s MacPhail tells Beauty Packaging that tubes continue to have a place in all product categories, noting that collections can be in haircare for colorants or large format tubes for shampoo. “Skincare and high-end derma require tubes to carry the expensive formulas and give some directional and controlled application,” says MacPhail. On the other hand, “Tubes offer a variety of smaller formats and are extremely portable. In the tube industry we continue to explore different materials to improve sustainability.”When it comes to sustainability, Beauchemin says Plastube tubes will generally weigh about 50% less than bottles for a comparable capacity making them a good sustainable option. Printing digitally on PCR tubes is the most sustainable option offered by Plastube because there is no ink purge at the end of the production with digital printing.CTL’s Olsen says “Tubes offer a great solution to brand owners looking for a packaging solution that delivers on fit, form and function. There can be a multitude of specs to choose from with mono-layer tubes, multi-layer tubes and various barriers and decoration capabilities. Tubes are inverted allowing consumers to evacuate the majority of their products by the nature of gravity.” He says tubes are also easy and fast to fill having a large opening [which can be] filled before being crimped and packed into shippers.Norden Machinery’s Sigvardsson points to tubes’ benefits around ease and hygiene.“Tubes are often a preferred packaging solution for cosmetics, and personal care products,” says Sigvardsson. “It is a hygienic and easy way to handle your product. You can apply the content (i.e, sunscreen or moisturizing cream) with only one hand, it is easily stored, and it is possible to pack large volumes at high speeds.” She explains that as the tube contains less packaging materials than an equivalent type of packaging, it is very efficient. Finally, she says, “the tube is a type of packaging that allows squeezing every bit of the content out, which means that no residue is left in the packaging, providing better value for the consumer, and no waste.”From ease of dispensing to innovative shapes and sizes, to sustainability, here’s what suppliers say brands are looking for in today’s tubes.At The Penthouse Group , Richard Esterbrook, director of sales, tells Beauty Packaging they have recently noticed that customers are looking for more interesting shapes in tubes, rather than the traditional round or oval shapes. While some tube vendors are able to injection mold a tube neck in different shapes like square, triangle, etc., the tube sleeve itself is usually not changed much as a result of it. However, through their “Blow Tube” innovation, Yoshino can utilize their bottle blow molding expertise to radically change the shape of the sleeve itself as well. (The Penthouse Group is the sales and customer service representative of Yoshino in North America.)The Penthouse Group has also responded to the eco-friendly call with Yoshino’s low profile flip top closure. Esterbrook says, “Sometimes simple changes to packaging can have a big impact on the environment over time.” One such idea that Yoshino commercialized in the Japan market was to minimize the height profile of a standard flip top closure, essentially making it shorter and saving cost and the amount of plastic resin used. He says, “Our hope is that by introducing this concept to the U.S. market, we can introduce a new trend so that eventually most flip top closures are transitioned to the low-profile type.”Norden Machinery’s Sigvardsson also speaks about new, innovative shapes for tubes. She says, “Some brands choose to fill their product in an oval tube, which gives an exclusive impression and a good grip in the hand. There is also Design-a-Seal, where the end of the tube can be in a bow or arched shape, making the tube look spectacular and [different].” She says one of the most creative applications that they have worked with is a foot crème with the top of the tube shaped as toes. She also cites examples of kids’ tubes where the top of the tube is shaped as a cat with ears, making it look cute and funny. “All this was possible because customers made a special request to Norden, and a special tooling was created so that the tubes could be produced in such a special design,” says Sigvardsson.As far as sustainability, Sigvardsson says, “Often, a mono-material tube is preferred, due to its recyclability. It is also popular with paper laminate and bio-plastics tubes.”At Viva, Gaudin tells Beauty Packaging that brands are looking to round out their product lines with different sizes of tubes, options for PCR content, different means of dispensing, and beautiful decoration options. Viva’s deodorant tube, powder tube, scalp applicator tube, and airless pump tubes were all developed to meet specific needs clients had for their product lineups. In addition, on the sustainable packaging front, “Viva tubes include a unique, tried and tested mono-material PP design that is compatible with the current rigid PP recycling stream,” says Gaudin.Viva recently developed the Head & Shoulders Clinical Scalp Calming Treatment Tube with a custom applicator that includes a longer nozzle than is typically available via a nose. This longer nozzle is able to navigate through hair down to the scalp area, for precision point application of a treatment that is to be applied up to four times a day. The tube comes in a convenient size for travel. The applicator is part of a mono-material design. Both tube and applicator are color-matched to the blue foil artwork, creating a continuous V-shape from the crimp down to the applicator tip, which is visible through the clear cap.”Plastube’s Beauchemin says many brand owners have made the commitment to reduce their environmental footprint by 20% - 50% by 2025 and as such are looking for greener material. He says Post Consumer Resin remains the most requested material, “which is understandable as it offers the best environmental footprint when compared to other materials.”Sustainability that doesn’t sacrifice product protection continues to dominate brands’ wish lists, says Neopac’s Schmid. “Our EcoDesign tubes offer strong barrier properties and elaborate decorative options (direct print, not labels) while comprising eco-conscious materials that can hold more than 30% PCR content; fit into existing PE or PP recycling streams (mono-material barrier tubes); be light weighted to save CO2 and plastics; are biodegradable; or have bio-based content.”At CTL, Olsen says brands are looking for small, medium and large tubes for various products in hair care, skin care, baby care and sun care to name a few. Materials range from extruded tubes (LLDPE, LPDE, MPE & HDPE) to laminate and IML polypropylene tubes. Many brands are looking for sustainable materials like sugar cane-based resin and/or post-consumer resins.It appears clear that tubes will remain a vibrant packaging category for the cosmetic industry due to their many benefits and advances in materials, sizes, dispensing and deco options. But similar to other packaging categories, challenges lie ahead as suppliers continue to meet rising demand.JSN’s Nagel says one of the primary challenges is “to reduce plastic content in plastic packaging via additions in sustainable resins, PCR content, and thin-walling existing packaging.”At Neopac, Schmid says, “Notably, the challenges we are facing as an industry include the price increase of raw materials, the scarcity of EVOH barrier material in particular, and the availability of qualified pure (food grade) PCR material on the market.”Known for its clean skincare and sustainability messaging, Summer Fridays premiered in 2018, with skincare packaged in aluminum tubes. It was not the norm at the time—but proved to be wildly successful. Beauty Packaging asked brand co-founder Lauren Ireland why they chose this packaging route. She told us:“From the start, we had a very clear vision of launching our first product in an aluminum tube. At the time, very few brands—particularly in beauty—had done it, and it felt really special. The look of a near-empty, crinkled aluminum tube of our Jet Lag Mask became a recognizable part of our brand story, as it quickly took over people’s Instagram news feeds. We believe our product’s unique packaging really helped catapult the success of the brand.“Of course, beyond the aesthetics of it, an aluminum tube is also recyclable, and sustainability was important to us and to our community. Our first three products—all face masks—were put into aluminum tubes. While we now have a wide product range and therefore a variety of packaging, our aluminum tubes are core to our brand and our long-term efforts of sourcing solutions that are both sustainable and practical.”With a heritage in sustainable practices, the Dutch-owned brand Bloomeffects creates products and packaging in sync with their DNA—for a true “field-to-face” beauty experience. Their multitasking Tulip Tint Lip & Cheek Balm is now available in 3 universal shades for all skin tones.Bloomeffects supports circular farming practices through the upcycling of imperfect tulip bulbs that would otherwise be discarded as “waste” and revitalizes them as ingredients in their skincare collection.The same care is given to their packaging, which tells the brand’s story at first glance. All Bloomeffects product cartons are FSC certified, made from 100% recycled materials, and are 100% recyclable. Tulip Tint packaging is made with PICEA wood tubes made from sawdust from German carpenters and other materials from renewable resources, “resulting in a carbon footprint that is 40% smaller than conventional plastic tubes.” The brand says it is also the first beauty brand to use PICEA in the U.S. Cartons are FSC-certified, made from 100% recycled materials and are 100% recyclable.",,[],[]
UPM Raflatac’s new Ocean Action label made from ocean-bound plastic,"Several brand owners and an institute share how extended producer responsibility schemes in Europe are driving packaging design changes.

States across the country increasingly are developing extended producer responsibility (EPR) legislation for packaging. Lawmakers in Maine and Oregon passed EPR legislation in 2021, and most recently, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed House Bill 22-1355 into law to establish a statewide recycling system that aims to boost recycling rates for plastic, aluminum, glass and paper in the state. Dozens of other EPR bills have been proposed in other states as well.

While only three states have passed EPR legislation for packaging to date, EPR systems for packaging have existed for more than 30 years in parts of Europe. With Europe's long history of EPR systems for packaging, Multinational consumer brand companies can provide EPR success stories that U.S. brands can learn from as more EPR bills are introduced in this country.

According to Boston-based Product Stewardship Institute (PSI), some European consumer brands have redesigned packaging to be reusable, recyclable, made with recycled content and circular in response to EPR. During a webinar titled EPR Masterclass – EPR Packaging Redesign Success Stories, PSI, along with representatives from a European institute and several consumer brands, shared a few examples of how brands have responded to EPR in Europe and what factors influenced them most to change packaging design to make it more recyclable.

Design for recycling drivers

Kennisinstituut Duurzaam Verpakken (KIDV), which is the Netherlands Institute for Sustainable Packaging, aims to reduce the environmental impact of packaging across the entire packaging value chain. The institute works with companies to provide knowledge and tools to deploy more sustainable packaging designs.

During the webinar, Karen van de Stadt, sustainable packaging expert at KIDV, shared that the institute also advises companies on EPR.

In Europe, Van de Stadt said she has seen the following four incentives drive companies to design recyclable packaging:

plastic pacts;

marketing and communications about sustainable actions taken;

corporate sustainability goals; and

eco-modulation, which is an approach by which EPR fees are informed by and structured according to environmental considerations and policy objectives in order to increase packaging recyclability and efficient use of materials.

She said plastics pacts—such as the U.S. Plastics Pact, the European Plastics Pact or the Plastics Pact Network—provide companies with goals to keep them accountable to make lasting changes to their packaging designs. She added that corporate sustainability goals as well as communication on sustainable actions companies have taken related to packaging design keep businesses accountable to follow through on packaging design plans. Additionally, she noted that eco-modulation and fees included in EPR schemes drive some businesses to change their packaging designs; however, she said it seems to be less of an influence.

Taking action

Three companies shared work they have done in Europe in response to EPR and designing their packaging for recyclability.

“EPR has been and will continue to be instrumental in organizing and making recycling operational,” said Gabriella Gabelli, director of environmental policy at PepsiCo.

PepsiCo, with global headquarters in Purchase, New York, is working toward a goal to ensure 100 percent of its packaging is recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or reusable by 2025. By 2030, the company aims to reduce the amount of virgin plastic in its nonrenewable sources per serving across its portfolio by 50 percent.

Gabelli said the company also endorsed and helped with The Consumer Goods Forum’s “Guiding Principles for the Ecomodulation of EPR Fees for Packaging” it released in February.

Although the company has had success with improving the design of its beverage packaging, Gabelli said it is a little more challenging when designing food packaging, such as its Walkers Crisps brand. She said that product line requires “serious protection” from oxygen, moisture and UV light to ensure high product quality. She said the company is working to maximize its use of polypropylene in the chip bag to yield higher quality recyclate from the product.

Feliks Bezati, global circular packaging director of McLean, Virginia-based Mars Inc., said EPR schemes are encouraging brand owners to design packaging to increase recyclability and influence recycling infrastructure.

“We have an influence through the EPR fees we pay,” he said. “We also have an influence when it comes to recycling industry. The more we use recycled material, the more we create demand for it. That’s why a few of us [brands] already have committed to use recycled materials.”

Bezati noted that Mars has a commitment to use 30 percent recycled material in its packaging by 2025. He added that the company wants to transform its portfolio to feature mostly monomaterial packaging in the future as well as a way to increase recyclability.

Additionally, some companies, such as Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble, are transitioning from virgin plastic to paper packaging or packaging that includes postconsumer resin in response to plastic taxes in some European countries.

“If there is a plastic tax, you may compensate that by using recycled material or completely changing your material,” said Jürgen Dornheim, director of corporate packaging innovation and sustainability at Procter & Gamble. He said Procter & Gamble has transitioned from using low-density polyethylene packaging for some of its Always menstrual hygiene products to paper packaging as an example.

He concluded that packaging design changes need to be made by top-level brand managers. “Change starts with the decision-making process,” Dornheim said. “Top management has to make this decision.”",,[],[]
Shuggie’s Trash Pie in San Francisco Turns Food Waste Into Pizza,"Twice a week, Kayla Abe and David Murphy go to the farmers market to pick up produce. But while other shoppers are selecting photo-worthy peaches, Abe and Murphy are picking up special orders — entire cauliflower plants from stem to full leaves, wilted greens, ugly mushrooms, bruised fruit — and taking it back to their pizza place, the aptly named Shuggie’s Trash Pie.

That’s where they apply their haul to items like the Casino pizza: The dough is made using spent oat flour (ground from the parts of the grain that remain after oat milk processing), and leftover whey. On top are excess mussels from a local retailer who couldn’t sell them that week; pig trotters that’ve been sliced and cured; and cooked down greens that wilted in the field of a Northern California organic farm.

The “trash” in Shuggie’s name refers to waste from farmers and other food suppliers, which the owners repurpose in all sorts of ways: Bruised fruit gets blended into frosé slushies, fish bycatch crowns a salmon belly pizza, and buffalo-flavored chicken gizzards and hearts make the most of meat offcuts. With the exception of the pepperoni pizza, every item on the Shuggie’s menu has multiple ingredients that would otherwise go wasted. (Murphy does insist on canned Stanislaus 7/11 tomatoes and low-moisture mozzarella to maintain a consistent base of flavor for the pizzas.)

Shuggie’s Trash Pie is the first restaurant from Abe and Murphy, the pair behind Ugly Pickle Co., which sells pickles made from irregular cucumbers and other upcycled produce. Shuggie’s wants diners to think about food they may have considered trash. In the bottom corner of the menu, there’s a short paragraph about how food waste is a contributor to climate change and one area of the global crisis where individuals can make a big impact. “We’re definitely not the first to do this,” Abe says. “But to make some sort of change in individuals’ lives, I think you have to make it this blatant.”

Projects from chefs like Dan Barber and Nick Balla have integrated food waste into fine dining, but Shuggie’s brings the idea to a pizza place with broad appeal, where diners are encouraged to have fun. The front room is painted from floor to ceiling in school-bus yellow, interrupted only by a giant painted image of a leopard head straight out of a tattoo studio flash book. The bar shines with dense hand-poured glitter. The second dining room is painted a deep green with matching hand chairs that make it look like the Jolly Green Giant is holding you in his palm.

Food waste is a huge, complex problem, not easily boiled down to a blurb on a menu or fun pizza toppings. About a decade ago, the USDA estimated that 30-40 percent of the American food supply was being wasted. A 2021 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report estimated greenhouse gas emissions from food waste in America each year are the equivalent of running 42 coal-fired power plants (and that’s without considering methane emitted from food decomposing in landfills).

In one field study in California, researchers at Santa Clara University found one-third of marketed crop yields were left behind in hand-picked fields. Greg Baker, lead author of the study, says market prices can dip so low it’s not worth the labor cost to harvest or package, or farmers may not bother harvesting produce with cosmetic issues they know retailers will turn down. Sometimes what’s left in the field is tilled back in, but not always.

“I would say the most frustrating problem is when we spend an entire season growing a crop and have given it all the attention, inputs, time, care. And then when it comes to harvest time, the market price is too low to justify harvest and the crop is left in the field,” says Cannon Michael, president of Bowles Farming Company.

Right now, Baker says, one of the primary outlets for these food losses are food banks, but there’s not always a good match between what farms have and what food banks need. Ugly produce boxes, farmers markets, and CSAs make another dent, especially for produce that can’t travel far. But the amount of food lost is still much greater than what these alternatives can take.

Any good chef, Murphy says, will get creative to prevent throwing out food. But launching a restaurant that relies on other people’s waste requires close relationships with farmers and suppliers, and flexibility in menu design that goes way beyond seasonality. “What we’re finding is that every farmer, and every food producer, is struggling with this issue in some way,” Abe says. “It’s just figuring out where, and then what’s feasible to actually partner on.”

In its first few weeks open, Shuggie’s has already made some tweaks based on changing waste streams. The usual 20-30 pounds of excess mussels that the restaurant gets every week ballooned to 80-90 pounds in the week after Mother’s Day; Murphy agreed to accept them, preserving them to extend shelf life. But Shuggie’s has had to turn down other offers. Some just don’t fit, like whole wheat flour that doesn’t match their pizza dough recipe or short-coded feta (a cheese that doesn’t — yet — feature in any Shuggie’s pies). Shuggie’s also hasn’t avoided supply chain issues, prompting last-second runs to markets for crucial ingredients. When they ran out of edible flowers one week, Abe and Murphy went foraging for a few days.

Ultimately the restaurant has to design a menu that stays stable enough to keep diners coming back while remaining flexible enough to deal with whatever waste pops up; that may sound challenging, but it’s just “basic chef-ery,” Murphy says. “What are going to be hits for a restaurant? What are the things that you’d have to have? We tried to do that, but just through the vehicle of food waste.”

Murphy clearly relishes the challenge, but is figuring out how to make it sustainable for the whole kitchen. A labor-intensive dish that featured sweet potatoes too large or gnarled for your average grocery store has been sidelined for now. “We’re still only [a few] weeks in, I don’t want to beat my guys up too much.” he says. “Let’s just right the ship before we start pulling in too much new stuff.”

And it’s not like the extra effort is a big money saver. While they can get a discount on things like offcuts, overall they want to pay suppliers fairly, so their food prices are comparable to a traditional restaurant. “I think the only way to create a market for other places, hopefully, that will take on this stuff, too, is to compensate people for it,” Abe says.

Market demand is growing. Miles Mountjoy, a sales specialist at Monterey Fish Market (where Abe and Murphy get salmon bellies, and also get fish frames to scrape down and make conserva) has seen fish offcuts go in and out of fashion in fine dining. Plus, “in a lot of other communities, [fish heads and collars] never [stopped] being popular,” he says; immigrant communities and restaurants in the area already bought a steady stream of fish heads. This isn’t news to Abe, who grew up in a Japanese household where fish bellies were considered prime cuts.

Mountjoy appreciates when these ingredients become more popular, because more people learn about something they might have considered trash, “but there’s also a cost,” he says. “All of a sudden fishing boats are selling fish heads for $5 a pound when it used to be $1.50. I don’t know how you can gentrify fish offcuts. But I think that might be the best way of putting it.”

Opening Shuggie’s is a risk for Abe and Murphy too. They have a small group of investors, so their savings are wrapped up in the restaurant. But they think it’s no more risky than any other restaurant opening right now. And they can rely on relationships with farmers that Murphy developed as a chef and that Abe made at the Bay Area food nonprofit Foodwise, which runs several farmers markets — the same relationships that made the food waste issue more concrete in their minds.

“There’s a million reasons why it wouldn’t be possible for chefs [to use more food waste],” Murphy says. “But I also think the conversations haven’t been there.”

There’s a distinction between food lost on farms and the food wasted after it leaves the field, the boat, or the pasture. It’s the second category — discarded during processing, thrown out by grocery stores or consumers — that makes up much of America’s wasted food. The day-to-day at Shuggie’s is focused on the former, but the hope is to impact the latter.

While the restaurant is committed to keeping their menu focused on “trash,” in some ways, the real product is easily digestible stories about food waste and the many ways to address it. “One restaurant upcycling stuff can have an impact in our very hyperlocal food shed,” Abe says, “but for people to take something home with them, and to change the way they eat — that’s where we actually can start to make a difference.”

Woman Sues Cosmetic Company Alleging False Claims About Mink Fur Lashes,"LOS ANGELES (CNS) - A woman is suing a cosmetic company with many celebrity clients, alleging its false eyelashes that contain mink fur are falsely advertised as being manufactured in a ""cruelty-free"" way when in fact they made in China in a manner abusive to the semiaquatic mammals.

""The animals frequently show signs of extreme psychological distress, such as frantic circling and self-mutilation, and suffer from infections, gaping wounds and other illnesses and injuries that commonly go untreated,"" according to Haylee Woodard's proposed Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit against El Segundo-based Lilly Lashes LLC.

Woodard's lawsuit allegations include false advertising, consumer fraud, unjust enrichment, breach of express warranty and negligent misrepresentation. Woodard seeks an injunction against Lilly Lashes' alleged manufacturing practices as well as a refund to all class members who bought mink eyelashes from April 2018 to the present in the suit brought Tuesday.

A Lilly Lashes representative did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Lilly Lashes sells cosmetics, including false eyelashes, eyeliner and mascara through the company's website as well as through such retail outlets as Sephora, Ulta Beauty and Amazon.com., primarily targeting young people through the social media, the suit states. Lilly Lashes has 2.4 million followers on Instagram and claims that Jennifer Lopez, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Rihanna and Lady Gaga are ""just a few of the A-List celebrities that have rocked the red carpet in their Lilly Lashes,"" the suit states.

The company's founder is Lilly Ghalichi, a former reality television personality who appeared on ""Shahs of Sunset"" on the Bravo network, the suit states.

Woodard began buying Lilly Lashes mink fur eyelashes at various locations in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties and paid $19 to $24 for each product, the suit states.

""At the time of purchase ... (Woodard) believed that the mink was `cruelty-free,""' but she would not have purchased the items had she known the processes allegedly used to make them, the suit states.

""Despite marketing its lashes as `cruelty-free,' Lilly Lashes knows that is lashes are created in a way that is harmful to animals,"" according to the suit, which cites a May 2020 article published on the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals website stating that the mink fur from which the mink eyelashes are made come from animals ""confined in cramped wire cages that are often caked with waste.""

When the mink fur is ready to be harvested, farmers commonly use the cheapest killing methods available -- including gassing, electrocution and neck- breaking -- before peeling the skin off the animals' bodies, according to the suit.

""Animal cruelty is clearly an important issue for customers of Sephora, Lilly Lashes and other brands that market products to young female consumers,"" the suit states.

Lilly Lashes also posts fake customer reviews on its website that are actually written by its own employees in order to entice buyers into purchasing the lashes, and markets some of its mink fur lashes as ""vegan,"" according to the suit.

""Defendants continue to engage in the deceptive practice and consequently, unwary consumers are injured on a daily basis by (Lilly Lashes') unlawful conduct,"" the suit states.

Woodard might purchase the products again if they do not contain mink and are properly labeled, the suit states.",,[],['City News Service']
"Beauty has a waste problem, and it’s not packaging","Despite an increased focus on sustainability, the beauty and skin care industries are not doing enough to address waste, say critics.

Just as it is in apparel, waste is built into beauty’s business model. However, most work to eliminate waste has so far been connected to packaging, while overlooking other sources. Waste is generated by formula testers, unsold or returned products and items that expire in warehouses or on store shelves. Compounding the problem is the lack of data on how much actually gets wasted, as well as a lack of solutions for managing that waste better. With retailers sending unsold inventory back to brands; expired or discontinued products being sent to the landfill; and unused products sitting in customers’ homes, it’s impossible to pinpoint the true numbers of the beauty industry’s waste. Arnaud Plas, co-founder and CEO of Prose, says he’s done his own research and estimates that between 20 and 40 per cent of beauty products, depending on the category, end up as waste.

What’s clear, according to multiple industry experts, is that it’s a massive amount, and some say the industry is intentionally not tracking its waste.

A handful of emerging brands, specialising in personalised, made-to-order beauty products, such as Prose and Pure Culture Beauty, say their models can help to reduce the problem. Their potential for impact relies not just on consumer buy-in, but also on the ability to shift the industry more broadly. Custom production that simply provides another avenue for people to buy more products is unlikely to reduce overall waste, but if it helps to nudge the industry to rethink how it operates and encourages consumers to demand change from their favourite beauty brands, the companies offering personalisation may be onto something.",,[],"['Condé Nast', 'Rachel Cernansky', 'Bella Webb']"
TechnicoFlor illustrates the potential of upcycling with eight fragrances,"As far as perfumery and cosmetic ingredients are concerned, upcycling is one of the most powerful trends of the moment. The growing interest in these new generation of sustainable materials, led the way to the launch of several ingredients resulting from this “creative reuse” at the last edition of the in-cosmetics Global show, which was held in Paris at the beginning of April. In perfumes, this desire to bring new value to previously neglected resources was illustrated by Cosmos’s Golden Berry, an ingredient made from the dried calyx of physalis, and by Eurofragance’s L’Âme du Bois, a captive fragrant ingredient derived from wood chips.

Co-products from the food and wooden furniture industries

TechnicoFlor perfumers saw in this trend a new olfactory playground and at in-cosmetics Global presented a collection of eight responsible fragrances developed from upcycled raw materials, in compliance with stringent environmental specifications. The challenge was to highlight an upcycled raw material within formulas that would be ""free from skin sensitizing danger"", 100% vegan, with a high percentage of biodegradable ingredients, a controlled environmental impact, and with fair trade materials.

Within their palette of upcycled raw materials, TechnicoFlor perfumers selected white wine lees (resulting from the deposit generated during the aging period of wine and champagne in barrels), oak wood (resulting from woodchips of wine barrels upgraded by CO2 extraction), carrot seeds (derived from seeds with low germinative potential), cocoa absolute (derived from cocoa pods), tangerine (extracted from the peel of the fruit), cypress absolute (derived from waste from the wooden furniture industry), or rose essential (derived from the distillation of petals that have already been used to create rose absolute).

Eight original fragrances

The selection process led to the creation of eight new, original and responsible fragrances — Raisin Divin, Up To Wood, Bois Tonic, Purple Fiction, Cacao Rosso, Sorbet Corse, Cypress’tige, Rosylicious — thus demonstrating that it is possible to transform ""waste"" into small olfactory treasures!

An ingredient can be considered upcycled when it is obtained by recovering by-products from industrial or agricultural transformation processes. Upcycled ingredients can be of natural or synthetic origin. By giving new life to materials that are often intended to be discarded, upcycling helps to decrease the waste of resources and is part of the circular economy movement and the regenerative culture. It also contributes to add unexpected materials to the perfumers’ palette.

This initiative from the French fragrance house is in line with its strategy of becoming a key expert in natural and responsible perfumery, which includes the creation of 100% natural ranges that comply with COSMOS Organic requirements (NatFlor perfumes), a committed purchasing policy, the sourcing of eco-responsible raw materials (BetterTomorrow®), a tool for measuring the biodegradability of perfumes (BioD-Scent®).",,[],"['Meiyume Develops Exclusive Halal Sun Care Formulation For Carasun', 'Makeup Brushes', 'How To Go Even Further In Designing Eco Products Of Tomorrow']"
Is the Humble Bar of Soap the Future of Beauty?,"Once upon a time, water took the top spot in nearly all beauty formulas. Whether the product in question was designed for skin, hair, or makeup, it didn’t matter— good old H2O was the first component on the ingredient list, where it was beloved for its user-friendly emulsions, non-sticky finish, and satisfying suds.

But the tides have turned. Brands are increasingly creating products without water and relying instead on butters and oils to deliver results. This shift has a ton of eco-potential, cutting back on waste, and—of course—water itself.

Despite their recent rise, the bars, powders, and concentrates that fill today’s shelves aren’t exactly new. In fact, the first shampoo bars debuted back in 1987, courtesy of Lush cofounder Mo Constantine and cosmetic chemist Stan Krysztal. There have always been “anhydrous products, or those ‘without water,’ such as face and body oils, balms, sticks, and powders,” says cosmetic chemist Marisa Plescia, research scientist at clean beauty retailer NakedPoppy. “But over the past few years, we have seen this category expand with fresh ideas and concepts.”

Rather than rebranding products that never had water in them to begin with, brands are developing water-free versions of traditionally water-based formulas, such as cleanser and conditioner.

Logistics plays a part in its rise, too. As consumers have largely moved from shopping shelves to scrolling pages, products have adapted accordingly. While companies used to compete for shelf space with bright, oversized bottles, Jenkins says, “shipping water around the world no longer makes sense.” Take water out of the equation and you’ve got yourself a smaller, more lightweight product to transport, which may translate to cost savings. (It’s hard to say, however, whether brands pass those savings on to consumers. Plus, “the cost of anhydrous materials can [actually] be higher,” says Plescia. “Water is cheap, while waxes, oils, butters, and powders are often not.”)

Ultimately, though, it comes down to supply and demand: Sustainability is finally having its moment in the sun—and forgoing water in a given product can create a domino effect of environmental benefits throughout its lifecycle. “In the last couple of years, consumers have become increasingly aware of the need to protect natural resources broadly and be more conservation-minded with water in particular,” says Mia Davis, vice president of Sustainability & Impact at Credo Beauty, a clean beauty retailer. And where consumers go, so do companies. “It's becoming more and more apparent to investors and companies that the manufacturing of products—and the disposal of them—have a huge impact on our younger consumers,” says Boma Brown-West, director of consumer health at the Environmental Defense Fund. The cosmetics industry is responsible for an estimated 120 billion beauty packages produced each year alone—most of which never gets recycled. “It's important that companies are recognizing that they have an environmental footprint and that they're actually taking action on it.”

Size, in this case, does matter. Since water equals volume, waterless beauty products are literally smaller than their traditional counterparts, and that can have an eco-friendly ripple effect. “Because you're reducing the size of a product, you're invariably reducing the amount of packaging needed,” says Brown-West. That could dramatically limit the item’s total carbon footprint. “A smaller product means more room on the truck to fit more products in,” she explains. “This can help reduce the amount of fuel that's being used to transport each product.” It can also shrink the amount of emissions, like carbon and air pollutants.

Then, there’s the recycling advantage. Some waterless products, such as solid bars, allow for more seamless recycling down the line. “If the result of making a product waterless reduces the need for smaller components, like caps, or materials that aren’t accepted by recycling programs, like pumps with metal parts, then there could be a benefit,” says Karen Hagerman, director of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition.

That’s what led entrepreneur Kate McLeod to seek out an alternative packaging for her eponymous line of solid moisturizer bars, which she calls stones. “Our solid formula forced me to look at packaging differently,” says McLeod, who ultimately went with a bamboo holder that’s both pretty and durable enough to be reused.

Speaking of the (environmental) devil—that’s plastic—waterless formulas make it possible to package products without the stuff at all since, depending on the formula, there’s less concern around dripping or leaking. That’s what drove the creation of HiBar, a plastic-free line of hair- and skin-care bars. “We looked at different product forms, like dissolvables and refillables, and concluded that our best chance at providing our customers with a high-quality product was simply eliminating water from the formulation,” says Dion Hughes, a cofounder of the brand. And that’s a big deal, seeing as fossil fuels are the main ingredient in plastic production. Roughly 91 percent of plastic never gets recycled, leading it to pile up endlessly in oceans and landfills.

Another perk: Preservatives aren’t really needed. After all, bacteria live their best lives splashing around in a water-rich environment; conversely, “in anhydrous formulas, the bacteria have a more of a difficult time growing since there is no water, so this risk is lower,” says Plescia. And fewer preservatives are a good thing, Jenkins adds, since “everything we use in our shower goes down the drain and into our water systems.”

These are all promising, environmentally sound reasons to swap your shampoo bottle for a bar. That said, it’s important to think about these things in context—not all water-free formulas are created equal. “A waterless product does not necessarily mean that the formula is more sustainable, that it took less energy or carbon to make, or has a great safety profile,” Davis explains. “Water is one major piece of the more-sustainable-product puzzle, but ‘waterless’ products may or may not be better for the environment or for you, the user.”

Part of that is because, while H2O might be out of the picture, there’s a whole lot of other stuff still in it. “With higher levels of other ingredients, the sustainability of those ingredients themselves can be brought into question,” Plescia explains.

Plus, Davis stresses that if you’re taking hour-long showers and drinking from single-use plastic water bottles, choosing a waterless beauty product won’t count for much. “Waterless beauty can be great, but it is not going to solve the water crisis,” she says.

Putting a pin in the sustainability conversation for a second, waterless beauty products have a host of other pros, like payoff in terms of potency and convenience. They tend to be more concentrated—meaning they’re packed with more nutrients, vitamins, and other beneficial compounds. “What I noticed from visiting different African communities is that the herbs, oils, and butters were all so rich and pure,” says 54 Thrones founder Christina Funke Tegbe, whose beauty line is rooted in waterless body butters. “A little truly went a long way. So the advantage is a more concentrated, efficacious product that goes further, because no water is used to cut it down.” And frequent fliers, behold: Some waterless products can be a dream for travel, eliminating a step in the always-anxiety-inducing TSA line.

Yet there’s still some downside to these amped-up formulations. One big consideration? The texture. While emulsions, like your average lotion, can feel smooth and satiny upon application, “an anhydrous formula, such as a balm, can be heavier with a sometimes-greasy feeling, which may not be desired by some consumers,” says Plescia.

Before you add a product to cart, do your research on the brand itself. For one, there’s always the risk of oversight in an industry that’s historically left women of color behind, notes Brown-West, who adds that waterless brands need to take women of color’s specific needs into account when formulating products. (For example, some brands only offer a single shampoo bar option—instead of considering all hair textures, including natural hair, when making them.) Also worth keeping in mind: The potential for greenwashing, a.k.a. the false implication that a company is more environmentally conscious than it is, is high wherever sustainability is involved. Some products have always been waterless, Hagerman says, (think powdered blush) and branding them as “waterless” is just a way to cash in on the hype.

Nuances notwithstanding, experts and founders agree waterless products are a net-positive development for the beauty industry—and definitely better than buying products consisting of non-recyclable packaging filled with non-sustainable ingredients. While they may take some getting used to, it’s worth the effort. As Jenkins puts it: “In the end, your hair and the planet will thank you.”

Mascara Allergy: What You Need to Know,"Share on Pinterest Igor Alecsander/Getty Images We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process. If wearing mascara leaves you with watery eyes, swollen or irritated eyelids, or itching and burning skin, you might suspect you have a mascara allergy. It’s possible to experience an allergic reaction after applying mascara, but this doesn’t necessarily mean you’re allergic to the mascara itself. Rather, you could have a sensitivity or allergy to one (or more) of the ingredients in your mascara. Allergic contact dermatitis is a common reaction to certain cosmetics, and some ingredients are more likely to cause a reaction than others. Read on to learn the signs and symptoms of an allergy to mascara ingredients, the ingredients most likely to trigger this reaction, and what to do next.

Signs and symptoms If you do have an allergy or sensitivity to ingredients in your mascara, you’ll mainly notice signs and symptoms in the area that makes contact with the allergen: your eyelid and lash line. If your mascara flakes off your lashes and into your eyes, you might have eye symptoms, too. You’ll most likely begin to develop symptoms shortly after applying a new mascara for the first time. That said, it’s also possible to develop allergic contact dermatitis after repeated use of a product over a long period of time. A mascara allergy or sensitivity can cause: a rash across your eyelid

bumps and blisters around your lash line

an itching and burning sensation

dry, flaky skin

eyelid swelling

red, watery eyes While these symptoms might feel super uncomfortable and annoying, they generally don’t become too severe — unless you’re extremely allergic to an ingredient in the mascara. Experts categorize allergic reactions and hypersensitivities from I to IV, with type I being the most severe and type I being the least severe. Makeup allergies are type IV. Keep in mind, though, that irritation doesn’t always indicate an allergy. Many skin care and beauty products can cause mild irritation or other adverse reactions, especially if you have sensitive skin. While you may not, strictly speaking, have an allergy, it never hurts to avoid any products that cause irritation or discomfort.

What causes a mascara allergy? A mascara allergy or sensitivity usually relates to a hypersensitivity to preservatives, dyes, and fragrances. If you have sensitive skin and have reacted to certain ingredients in the past, you’re more likely to have a reaction to those ingredients in mascara. Preservatives are a common culprit because water-based makeup, like most mascara, often contains them in especially high amounts. It must be emphasized, though, that preservatives aren’t inherently bad. In fact, they play an essential role in preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms that could cause irritation and infection. Some common preservatives in mascara that can lead to irritation include: parabens

sodium benzoate

quaternium-15 (formaldehyde releaser) Allergic to nickel or other metals? The black iron oxide sometimes used to color mascara might also cause an allergic reaction, due to nickel contamination. Fragrance, another common component in mascara, can also cause irritation. “Fragrance” serves as an umbrella term for the various ingredients that give cosmetics a pleasant scent — or help mask the less-than-pleasant scents of other ingredients. Fragrance can contain alcohol, essential oils, and other potential irritants and allergens. Around 1 percent of adults have fragrance allergies. In fact, when it comes to triggers for allergic contact dermatitis, fragrance allergy takes second place, while nickel allergy holds the top spot.

Do I need medical treatment? Taking the allergen away should stop your symptoms. To take the allergen away, you’ll want to completely remove all traces of the mascara from your lashes and surrounding skin. Applying a cool compress may help relieve the irritation. It’s best to stop using the product you link to the reaction. Once the irritation goes away, you can try another brand instead. If your symptoms don’t improve after a day or two, or they get worse, a good next step involves reaching out to a medical professional for more guidance and treatment. Avoid picking or scratching at the irritated area. Excessive rubbing and scratching could introduce bacteria into your eyes or tiny openings in your skin. Consequently, eyelid dermatitis can sometimes lead to complications like skin infections and eye infections. You’ll want to get medical attention if you notice: pus

discharge

worsening pain

severe inflammation or swelling

Preventing allergic reactions Checking the ingredients in a mascara before you use it is generally the best way to prevent an adverse reaction. If you think you might have an allergy or sensitivity to any common skin care ingredients, avoid mascara that contains those ingredients. Another helpful step? Try patch testing the product before you apply it to your eyes. To do a patch test: Apply a small amount of the product to a less-noticeable spot on your face, like just under your jaw or behind your ear.

Leave the area alone for at least 24 hours.

Check for any unwanted reactions, like stinging, swelling, or flakiness.

If you’d like to be absolutely certain, repeat these steps for a few days. You won’t always notice a reaction the first time you use a product.

No reaction? Go ahead and use the mascara. Just keep in mind a patch test doesn’t offer a guarantee, especially when it comes to products you use around your eyes. Eyelid skin is very delicate, and it might react to a product that doesn’t affect skin elsewhere on your body. If you have sensitive skin, opt for mascara labeled: for sensitive skin

Does China Want Clean Beauty? Ren Is Banking On It,"What Happened: Ren Clean Skincare is giving its China campaign a makeover. On June 1, the high-end skincare label under Unilever appointed Mandarin pop idol Evan Lin as its brand ambassador. In his announcement video on Weibo, Lin highlights that Ren uses plant-based ingredients and recyclable packaging, inviting consumers to experience “pure and natural beauty from the inside out.” As of publication, the post has raked in over 2 million views and 540,000 shares.

The Jing Take: Founded in London in 2000, the British beauty firm has built a reputation for its cruelty-free formulas, focus on sensitive skin types, and commitment to sustainability. In fact, at the end of 2021, the company met its zero waste pledge to make 100 percent of its packaging recycled, recyclable, and reusable. With hero products such as the Ready Steady Glow Daily AHA Tonic and Evercalm Overnight Recovery Balm, Ren Clean Skincare has developed a cult following that counts Hollywood actress Emma Roberts and British royalty Lady Amelia Windsor among its fans.

This latest marketing push in China comes as the country moves towards cruelty-free cosmetics. In May 2021, the government put an end to mandatory animal testing for a majority of general cosmetics (including shampoo, body wash, and makeup), a requirement that had prevented many cruelty-free businesses from importing products directly. In addition to policy support, consumer appetite for clean beauty has also grown: 90 percent of Chinese consumers noted that purchasing healthy or eco-friendly products was important to them, putting the mainland ahead of other major markets in demand, according to AlixPartners. Another report by McKinsey shows that 80 percent of shoppers here were willing to pay for sustainable packaging compared with 68 percent among Americans.

With China being the second-largest beauty market after the US, these interested consumer segments cannot be overlooked. Although Ren Clean Skincare is still a niche name there — sporting just 35,000 followers on Weibo and 1,000 related posts on Xiaohongshu — its fresh face could give the clean beauty proponent the momentum it needs.

Aptar and Quadpack join forces to develop refillable wooden lipstick,"Barcelona-headquartered beauty packaging supplier Quadpack has combined its expertise in wooden packaging with Aptar’s technology in lipstick mechanisms. The two companies have jointly developed a refillable lipstick which aims to push the boundaries of sustainability and sensory appeal in makeup packaging.

Minimising environmental impact

Dubbed “Iconic Woodacity lipstick”, the new packaging solution was designed for minimal impact and maximum consumer engagement. It combines Aptar’s Iconic mechanism with Quadpack’s Woodacity full-wood patented technology.

Aptar’s POM-free, glue-free and lubricant-free mechanism offers a smooth, constant and precise rotation, thus allowing smooth actuation of the bullet over time. According to the company, the mechanism is reliable and compatible with most filling lines without any adjustments, and recognised as a quality standard by leading makeup brands worldwide.

Attached to an aluminium tube, the mechanism is contained in a monomaterial wooden casing custom-designed and manufactured by Quadpack. Made of 100% certified ash wood from sustainably-managed forests, the casing opens and closes with an intuitive gesture. The patented ‘Solo Twist’ system features an oval-shaped interior which ensures that the cap auto-locks on a quarter turn. “The twist gesture is a departure from standard click closures, making it fresh and fun,” said Quadpack in a statement.

The lipstick is refillable with ease: consumers simply pull out the used mechanism and snap in the new one. It is also possible to use refills of different colours simultaneously with one single casing to further reduce the pack’s impact.

In addition, wood brings a natural touch and a specific sensory dimension to the pack.

Entirely made in Europe

The entire pack is made in Europe. The mechanism is manufactured by Aptar beauty + home in Chavanod, France (formerly Aptar Reboul). Aptar Chavanod uses renewable energy, while 95% of production waste is reused or recycled.

The wooden container – with PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) or FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certification on demand – is made at Quadpack’s wood factory in Catalonia, Spain, where a biomass plant converts production waste into energy.",,[],"['Meiyume Develops Exclusive Halal Sun Care Formulation For Carasun', 'Makeup Brushes', 'How To Go Even Further In Designing Eco Products Of Tomorrow']"
"Everyday Humans founder on joining Target Zero, achieving plastic neutral","This interview was conducted via email.​

To start off, tell me a bit about Everyday Humans and the brand’s mission around packaging.

Everyday Humans is an innovative SPF-led skincare brand that designs consciously made sunscreens and everyday skincare with a sustainability focus. As a certified Plastic Neutral and Climate Neutral company, our efforts are demonstrated through our choice of packaging, raw ingredients, manufacturers, and partners.

Everyday Humans Founder Charlotte Chen Pienaar. Image courtesy of Everyday Humans

Our entire portfolio’s plastic tubes are made of PCR, with some products achieving as high as 100% recycled plastic. Our goal is to find even more innovative delivery systems to house sunscreen and skincare products in a more sustainable manner.

What did getting your sunscreen line into the Target Zero Collection look like?

We are honored to be selected by Target to be one of the inaugural brands featured in Target Zero - an initiative supporting and promoting brands that are designed to reduce waste and make it easier to shop sustainably.

Now in stores across the country and on Target.com, the Target Zero collection features hundreds of products with packaging designed to be refillable, reusable or compostable, or made from recycled content that reduces the use of plastic

What did becoming plastic neutral look like?

To achieve plastic neutrality, we work with our partners at rePurpose Global, which is the world’s leading plastic action platform that aims to help conscious businesses reduce their plastic waste.

To begin, we first calculate our company’s plastic usage and its monetary equivalent. From there, we offset it by supporting vetted environmental projects that remove as much plastic waste from nature as we create.

These projects include recovering plastic waste streams that damage marine ecosystems, financing new waste infrastructure, and scaling up virgin plastic alternatives. This way, we are able to make a quantifiable impact that tackles the beauty industry’s plastic crisis.

What is the value to you as a brand of focusing on packaging waste in a mass-market setting?

According to the Plastic Pollution Coalition, the beauty industry generates more than 120 billion units of packaging annually around the world, and most of it is not recyclable. In line with this, the cosmetics market only continues to grow rapidly and is predicted to hit a whopping $ 560.50 billion value by 2030.

Evidently, this is an impending source of massive plastic pollution. As a pro-planet skincare brand, it is our responsibility to address this by utilizing the most environmentally friendly packaging available to us at the moment.

Simultaneously, we leverage partnerships with organizations such as rePurpose Global to help us offset our plastic footprint. Through this, we hope to raise the bar for mass-market skincare products and contribute to a more sustainable industry overall.

What is the next step for Everyday Humans?

Products in refillable packaging will be our next milestone. While the concept of refillable packaging is not new, it can be improved to make the system more accessible to consumers. For example, instead of designing refilling stations or requiring the return of packaging, this could include refills that are identical in size to the original product, so that consumers only need to swap them out once the product is emptied.

Of course, we also continue to explore strategies that use less plastic or other innovative packaging solutions.",,[],['Ravyn Cullor']

Travel Size Beauty Products That Will Make Packing Easier,"Summertime, for most people, means taking a much-needed holiday vacation. Aside from the inevitable trials and tribulations that come with travel, some mishaps can be prevented with proper planning. There is no joy in having your favorite toiletries seized at security for being over 3.4oz or arriving at your destination only to realize you’ve forgotten your skincare, body care and haircare essentials.

The solve? Stock up on all your essentials in travel sizes that can come with you in your carry-on. That way, whatever the travel occasion, you’ll be trip ready — without any packing stress.

To prep for your next jet-set moment, we’ve curated a list of travel essentials for you to pack, without having to check a bag.

The Hero Starter Pack

If you’re a last minute packer (like I am), investing in a kit that already has everything you need saves time and brings forth relief. Take the thinking out of packing with Aesop’s Departure Kit, which will ensure you’re staying hydrated and keeping up with good oral hygiene no matter your location, or skincare kits from Dr. Barbara Sturm, so there’s no stressing over maintaining a skincare routine while away.

Miscellaneous Products

Sometimes you need a few more products that aren’t included in an all-in-one kit. From face oils, a mini facial cleanser to hand sanitizer, keep these standby products in your trusty travel pouch, so they’re ready to go whenever you are.

Travel-Friendly SPFs

Packing a TSA-compliant sunscreen is essential. Purchasing SPF while away is often a waste of time and product when having to throw it away on your way home. (Think sustainably.) From a tinted SPF serum from Ilia to cult-favorite Glossier‘s Invisible Shield, these travel-ready options will keep you selfie-ready and sun-protected while on holiday.

On-The-Go Hair Care For Everywhere

Maintaining your hair when on vacation can be a mission. Put your tresses in a high ponytail, or rub this hair gloss from BREAD through your soft curls to keep up with those good at-home hair days.",,[],"['Stixx M', 'Teresa Lam', 'Collette Grimes', 'Jennifer Machin', 'Hb Team']"
The Most Viral TikTok Beauty Products of 2022 (So Far),"Just like when YouTube makeup tutorials first hit our computer screens and became our go-to for all things beauty, we’ve come to accept TikTok as a daily (and constant) source of hair, skincare, and makeup inspiration. Now, there are new viral beauty trends emerging on a weekly, if not a daily basis (including ones we all shouldn't be trying at home). Furthermore, we’ve all learned that a viral video can have products flying off the shelves of IRL stores. And no one like to be the last one shut out of getting in on the next big trend or miracle product.

While the power of a new generation of beauty gurus and “skinfluencers” is undeniable, not every product is worth fighting other TikTok obsessives to buy. Not every “hack” will actually save your skin, not every unusual technique will suit your aesthetic, or even be very practical. Instead, like the face taping trend, some might be give results opposed to your beauty goals or at least waste your time. It can be hard to know who to trust on the app, but there are some clear stand-out products that multiple creators (and experts) have approved. Below, we’ve rounded up the best of the many, many viral TikTok beauty products of 2022 so far. Come back for updates as the year goes on.

Clean Beauty Brand Iris & Romeo’s 'Weekend Skin’ Delivers SPF and Vitamin C in Multitasker Format,"



Michele Gough Baril Michele Gough Baril

Direct-to-consumer skincare-meets-makeup beauty brand Iris & Romeo says Weekend Skin—its new mineral sunscreen that also delivers the benefits of vitamin C—is all about doing the minimum and getting maximum results. The 3-in-1 formulation combines a soft-focus filter, SPF 50 and time-release vitamin C.Founder Michele Gough Baril contends Weekend Skin is the first product to put clinical levels of vitamin C with mineral SPF, combining two important steps in one’s daily skincare routine. .“It’s called Weekend Skin because we believe that Saturday feeling—easy, well-rested, and glowing—should really last all week,” said Baril, who founded the San Francisco-based clean beauty company in 2019.Happi asked Baril to share more details about the formulation.The problem with vitamin-C is once it’s exposed to daylight it oxidizes, becomes unstable and loses efficacy. The Vitamin C in Weekend Skin has a time-release delivery system which allows it to be metabolized more gradually into the skin than other Vitamin C actives, and having it supplied on a continuous, slow-release basis keeps the dose at fresh, potent levels. In commercial testing, it has been proven to have superior formulation stability to other Vitamin C materials on the market. It also allows you to reapply frequently without irritating the skin.The whole point of sunscreen is to get people to wear it, and so it has to look aesthetically pleasing on the skin. We wanted to create a blurring glow effect that was universal, meaning it worked for every skin tone. Up until now, brands have had to create at least two different shades to work for all skin tones – a cool tone and a warm tone. Not everybody knows their undertone and our ethos is to make products that are simple to use, so we set out to find a neutral pigment that would work for everyone and give a glowy, never glittery effect that is perfect for daytime. It truly looks like that fresh-from-the-facialist glow you get after visiting your esthetician. You can’t mess it up. We achieved this with the mica in the formula that is also ethically-sourced. We tested the shade on the Fitzpatrick scale and it looks gorgeous on everyone. We’ve made it really easy as no shade-matching is required.It’s good for consumers and it’s good for our planet. Combining skincare and makeup saves time, money and waste. It's good for skin health because it takes the guesswork out of expert skincare. We know what skincare actives work together. Often that’s hard for consumers to figure out — should I wear vitamin C with niacinamide, for example? Weekend Skin has niacinamide in at 2%, which is an active level. It’s important to understand this especially when you’re working with clinical doses as you could cause damage to your skin. When a formula is put together by an expert chemist they consider this. If we can combine multiple steps into one, it’s a win.",,[],[]
"How to Vet Beauty Brands in 2022, According to Estée Laundry","If you look at the beauty landscape today, it certainly feels like there are more beauty brands than ever. From celebrity-owned lines becoming the new celebrity-perfumes-circa-the-early-2000s to a new skin-care, makeup, or hair-care product popping up on your For You Page every day, vetting the brands that you want to support can feel like a full-time job.

This is where Instagram accounts like Estée Laundry come in. A self-described ""beauty collective"" that launched in April 2018, the page has been hailed as a sort of quasi watchdog for the beauty community, making it a point to hold the industry accountable. From calling out cultural appropriation to spotlighting beauty executives displaying problematic behavior, one Instagram post to Estée Laundry's almost 200K followers has the power to spark conversation around any topic that might otherwise go unnoticed.

While the beauty industry has taken strides in the right direction since the page's inception, the truth is there is much work to be done. Beauty is one of the largest contributors to landfill waste, many companies are still pushing outdated and harmful beauty standards in marketing materials, and the mistreatment of employees is still going on behind closed doors. That's why Estée Laundry is sharing the most common markers of a beauty brand doing it right that you can look for when shopping — so you can feel good about the products you're adding to your cart.

Tip 1: Pay Attention to a Brand's Inclusivity Efforts

The collective has some metrics to help you narrow down the next brand you want to support. Chief among them? Inclusivity and sustainability. ""Alongside creating innovative, well-made products, brands need to ensure they're being conscientious,"" Estée Laundry tells POPSUGAR. ""In the past, 'exclusive' used to be considered synonymous with luxury, but times have changed and inclusivity is everything.""

Gone are the days when Instagram feeds or ads only feature one skin color or body type. Now, beauty brands have a responsibility to own their parts in giving visibility to marginalized communities otherwise excluded from the conversation. ""When thinking of diversity, for instance, it's no longer enough if you're using a few BIPOC models that conform to Euro-centric beauty ideals,"" Estée Laundry says. ""Brands that meaningfully include people with different body types, genders, and disabilities are the ones moving the conversation forward.""

Doing just enough to hit isn't enough, though, and consumers can easily spot a brand not truly committed to the work. ""The brands that are hitting those metrics are the ones that are setting new standards,"" Estée Laundry says. ""It's not enough if you're doing the bare minimum. It's about finding ways to go above and beyond.""

Tip 2: Look For Authenticity

One of the easiest ways for a brand to better serve its customer base is to be more authentic. ""Being open and honest is always a great strategy,"" Estée Laundry says. ""If a brand is working on a metric, they can be upfront about it. Customers love transparency and are willing to support brands who take them on their journey.""

Tip 3: Note When Brands Own Up to Their Mistakes

One of the most common mistakes that the collective sees brands making is not owning up to their slip-ups. ""No brand is perfect and they're all bound to make mistakes, but the best way to handle a mistake is by acknowledging it and taking action — not just hoping that it will blow over,"" Estée Laundry says.

Take Ulta Beauty, for example, which sent out a marketing email with a poor word choice in its subject line. Instead of brushing the incident under the rug, the retailer addressed it head-on: ""Ulta Beauty acknowledging and apologizing for an insensitive word choice to describe a Kate Spade product has been a great example of a company owning up to a potential oversight,"" Estée Laundry says.

Another way to see if a brand is owning up to its mistakes is if it listens to its customers, and not only when it comes to feedback on a product. ""The way Estée Lauder fired executive John Demsey for his racist meme a few months ago was a good example of a brand taking immediate steps to stop things from escalating further,"" Estée Laundry says. ""They listened to their consumer's concerns and were lauded for their swift decision making.""

Tip 4: Note When Brands Take a Stand

When brands do make it a point to listen to their customer bases, Laundry often gets that positive feedback too. ""There has been so much positive commentary on E.l.f. Cosmetics's decision to take a stance on reproductive rights,"" Estée Laundry says. ""They stood firm despite getting trolled by anti-abortion groups and their customer based loved it.""

While no brand will ever be perfect, using your money to support companies that align with your ideals is one way to amplify the causes that are important to you. So before you go on your next shopping trip, keep these tips in mind.",,[],['Ariel Baker']

""I finished first and went over to help this woman. She wanted a shade match for a foundation, so I picked one out and handed her the tester to try. She told me it was too light, but I knew it was her shade. I put it back, pretended to shuffle things around on the shelf, and handed her the EXACT SAME tester. She tried it on and proclaimed, 'Now THIS is the right shade!' She bought the foundation. I said nothing.""

Paper waste: to compost or not to compost,"Photo by Digital Buggu from Pexels.

With so much paper being thrown into garbage bins, it is a comforting idea that homeowners can reduce their waste by composting paper. Just how exactly this can be done can be mind-boggling. And with so many different types of material used for paper, it might be tempting to not bother and just throw paper into the garbage bin as usual.

Paper should not be that complicated. Here are some common paper products in typical households and whether it’s best to compost them or not.

Before going into this, it is vital to remember that compost should contain a balanced mix of brown waste such as dried leaves, wood chips, and paper, as well as green waste like food scraps and grass clippings.

Printed papers

Inks used for printing are usually non-toxic nowadays. Just make sure to avoid heavily printed paper if the compost will be used for edible crops. Most inks are water-soluble or vegetable oil-based, but even inks made from petroleum and other minerals can also be composted.

This means newspapers are compostable. Just make sure to cut them into small pieces to help improve the aeration of the compost heap.

Glossy papers

Glossy papers like those used for magazines or gift wrappers are made with clay or resins, some coated with a type of plastic that makes them unsuitable for composting. This includes some receipts that are made from glossy paper.

Toilet or kitchen paper

Toilet or kitchen paper can be composed depending on what it was used for. The case with composting them is that they may introduce unwanted bacteria. Avoid composting paper that has been used with chemical cleaning agents or cosmetic products. It is also best not to compost paper that was used to clean a surface from grease.

"Health, Sustainability and E-Commerce Drive Beauty Packaging Innovation","The beauty packaging industry is resilient. Despite the pandemic, sales increased by 3% from 2020 to 2021. Toiletries categories remain the largest contributors to packaging volumes globally, led by everyday hygiene products such as bar soap, shampoo and toothpaste. To meet the needs of new consumer routines, shopping habits and preferences, beauty brands are changing their packaging designs in fundamental ways and prioritising sustainable and digital investments.

Consumers focus on health, hygiene and wellbeing

The pandemic heightened the focus on health, wellbeing and hygiene. While product claims such as holistic, clean, and natural still resonate with consumers, their focus is shifting towards the basic principles of health and being free from disease. Beauty consumers are embracing self-care and adopting healthier lifestyles, with the home becoming their main wellness hub. In terms of packaging, the focus on hygiene translates into growing packaging volumes for toiletries, and demand for hygienic solutions continues to grow, benefiting stick formats in categories such as skin care and colour cosmetics. For example, Milk Makeup’s range of products in stick format allows consumers to carry out a skin care routine without touching their face. Meanwhile, ingredient safety and transparency have also become essential to consumers. Increasingly, therefore, brands clearly list the ingredients used in the composition of their products on the packaging, protect the integrity of the formulation using airless packaging, and use NFT technology to convey more information on the product.

Sustainable packaging is a key factor driving purchases

According to Euromonitor International’s Voice of the Consumer: Lifestyles Survey, 67% of consumers tried to have a positive impact on the environment through their everyday actions in 2021. Similarly, 46% of global consumers used sustainable packaging such as refillable, recyclable, biodegradable or compostable packaging in 2021. The beauty industry has been focusing on sustainability for a long time, but the pandemic put social and environmental issues in the spotlight, leading consumers to opt for brands that can deliver positive change. Increasingly, companies are under scrutiny to honour any commitments made to build a more sustainable and ethical future. Also, brand owners and packaging manufacturers are accelerating eco-friendly innovations to reduce plastic use and water waste. For instance, The Body Shop relaunched its body butter range in recyclable packaging made of a 100% recycled PET jar and aluminium lid. Meanwhile, Unilever, following the launch of its refillable Dove deodorant in 2021, extended its refillable offer by launching a concentrated refill for its Dove Body Wash in 2022.

E-commerce continues to gain ground

The beauty industry still heavily relies on store-based sales. However, e-commerce gained momentum during the pandemic, with beauty shoppers moving online. In 2021, 18% of global beauty value sales were made online, posting an increase of six percentage points in comparison to pre pandemic, in 2019. Online shopping is predicted to grow faster in the years to come. Euromonitor’s Voice of the Industry 2021 survey also shows that beauty companies consider that changes in consumers’ shopping and spending behaviour as a result of the pandemic will be permanent. Rising demand for beauty products online requires robust packaging fit for shipping. Growing volumes of letter box packaging are being seen as the penetration of beauty subscriptions continues to rise, with brands such as Curology offering bespoke skin care products delivered through the letter box. Besides, the shift towards e-commerce has prompted new beauty sampling solutions, especially in fragrances and colour cosmetics. Christian Dior launched its J’adore fragrance in a miniature roller-pearl format which comes in a 20ml pack size. This smaller pack size can be an alternative to sampling and represents an entry point to the premium beauty universe.

Evolving wellness priorities require beauty companies to adjust their product and packaging offer to meet consumers’ new needs, while ensuring trust, safety and transparency. And, as technology develops, innovation is expected to focus on circular models, as well as sustainable and transparent supply chains. Meanwhile, digitalisation and the rise of e-commerce will impact the evolution of the role of packaging and its design requirements, and establishing a strong digital presence will set beauty companies apart from competitors.

Beauty events are roaring back. Getting it right isn’t so easy,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

In a dimly lit basement, gym-goers run on state-of-the-art treadmills and lift dumbbells in choreographed unison as loud music blares from speakers. The venue operates a slick check-in system, and a smoothie bar and expensive toiletries are on tap to enjoy after the session. But, this isn’t just another exercise class — it is the kind of community-building event that science-led skincare brand 111Skin has begun hosting, in collaboration with various trendy gyms, for press and influencers.

“High-performance workouts connect very well with high-performance skincare,” says Eva Alexandrides, who co-founded 111Skin with husband and plastic surgeon Dr. Yannis Alexandrides. “It’s a new way of communicating rather than over a sit-down meal.”

As vaccination rates rise and governments globally relax their pandemic regulations, 111Skin is among many beauty brands that are back to hosting press events — but not as before. Launches for new product colourways or packaging releases are increasingly viewed as frivolous or wasteful, but with marketing budgets back, PRs are under pressure to deliver innovative and effective events for brands.

As a result, one-to-one affairs and intimate, community-building activities with personal and environmental benefits are replacing standard cocktail party product launches, as PRs seek to communicate brand messages – some following a Covid reset – in more creative and engaging ways. Brands also need to be more considerate of their footprint as consumers (and press) become aware and critical of the impact of events.

LVMH-owned Benefit Cosmetics faced an online backlash in May for taking a group of influencers on a trip to Hawaii to promote its new product line, amid Hawaiians claims their home is being damaged due to overtourism. Benefit’s posts on Instagram and TikTok were called “tone deaf” and the trip “disrespectful”.

In a statement shared with Vogue Business, Benefit Cosmetics said it was “committed to supporting local communities” including a local beach clean, gifting provided from local brands including Kokua Sun Care and Mohala Eyewear and a donation to Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii, a non-profit that works to preserve the local environment.

"Single-use Packaging Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2022 - 2027)","ReportLinker

The global single-use packaging market (henceforth referred to as the market studied) was valued at USD 36. 76 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach USD 50. 98 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of approximately 5.

New York, June 10, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Single-use Packaging Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2022 - 2027)"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06249273/?utm_source=GNW

74% during the period of 2022-2027 (henceforth, referred to as the forecast period).



Key Highlights

The changing consumer buying behavior due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak and the growing adoption of flexible, cheap, and easy-to-use packaging are major factors driving the investment in the single-use packaging market. In the present world, most end-user industry organizations adopt designs upon which modern life seems to depend, like single-use paper or plastic beverage cups, lids, straws, and bottles.

The advantages of plastic bags over their alternatives are still massive. During the recent COVID-19 outbreak, single used packaging’s advantages without the availability of suitable substitutes cannot be denied. For instance, single-use plastic is extensively used to keep food contaminant-free, produce masks, gloves, and other protective equipment, and even manufacture syringes and other key healthcare equipments.

Furthermore, producing one disposable cup has a lower environmental impact than producing one reusable cup or bottle. And producing a Styrofoam or paper cup requires much less energy input than reusable alternatives such as plastic, glass, or ceramic.

Governments across all the nations have responded to public concerns regarding packaging waste, especially plastic packaging waste. They are implementing regulations to both minimize environmental waste and improve waste management processes. This would negatively impact the market’s growth.

The COVID-19 pandemic provided significant relief to the single-use packaging vendors. Although many countries were slowly banning these packaging and promoting reusable packaging, the pandemic changed the consumer and government’s behavior toward it. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the demand for sanitizers, soap, disinfecting wipes, and sprays increased exponentially. The majority of these products are packaged with single-use plastic. The orders were so huge globally that the manufacturers and packaging companies in the field even expanded their facilities, which most governments also supported.



Key Market Trends



Miniaturization of Packaging Materials to Boost the Adoption of Single-use Packaging



Miniaturization in packaging is mostly done for lower material consumption, reduction in costs, and to reduce transportation costs; moreover, it also helps in waste reduction.

The packaging industry is being reshaped by changing lifestyles. Consumers are expecting more convenient, timely, and portable solutions, in addition to the snackification of mealtimes (’grazing’ on snacks throughout the day). As a result, the need for smaller amounts to be consumed numerous times per day will necessitate multiple packaging packs, increasing packaging material consumption.

In mature markets, consumers are also leading busy lives, necessitating the need for more handy, timely, and portable solutions, such as smaller packets that they can carry with them and open. Even at home, the trend for grazing has accelerated the transition to smaller groups.

The small pack trend appeals to a health-conscious and calorie-conscious public: customers want ready-to-eat food with reasonable portions. Small, flexible snack packs and single-serve quantities of breakfast cereal are examples of products that satisfy the need.

Changing demographics, which have resulted in smaller average home sizes, have highlighted the need for packaging solutions that fulfill the demands for convenience and reduce food waste.

COVID-19 changed many things, including putting a stop to many people’s on-the-go lifestyles. To assist and alleviate the health crisis, people were forced to travel and work limitations, which had a direct impact by increasing the craving for comfort foods.



Asia Pacific Expected to Hold a Significant Market Share



China has one of the world’s largest economies and is a major manufacturing center. China’s GDP increased by 8.1% in 2021, despite a reduction in consumption due to Covid-19-related restrictions and a catastrophic power deficit in the second half of the year. The strong manufacturing in electronics, pharma, cosmetics, and food and beverage presents a huge opportunity for the packaging industry in the country.

China has a huge cosmetic market, with very high local consumption as well as exports. According to CIRS Group, exports of beauty products and wash suppliers were 445,794 tons in the first half of 2021, up 1.6% from the previous year. Imports totaled CNY 133.0654 billion, up 2.6% from the same period the previous year. According to China Customs, the value of beauty items exported from China in 2020 was USD 4.24 billion, up from USD 2.77 billion the previous year. China exported over one million metric tons of personal care and cosmetic items worldwide in the same year.

Japan is also a major manufacturing hub in Asia, with high-quality products and best manufacturing practices. Japan is a leader in the world when it comes to manufacturing. Apart from its impeccable electronics and huge automobile sector Japan also is a global producer of cosmetics and one of the biggest consumers for single-use plastic packaging materials.

India is one of the most populous countries in the world and ranks 2nd only after China. According to IMF, the current population of the country is approximately 1391.99 million in 2021 and is expected to reach 1455.82 million by 2026. This large mass of the country also makes the country a heavy consumer of all sorts of products. Therefore, India presents a huge market for the packaging industry as well.

South Korea boasts a thriving cosmetics industry, with China being the top destination for skincare products shipped from the country in 2021, according to the Korea International Trade Association. The value of skincare cosmetics exported from South Korea to China was around USD 2.84 billion. It was followed by Hong Kong and the United States, which exported skincare worth USD 391.4 million and USD 340.5 million, respectively.

Eurofragance Presents New Collections At In-Cosmetics 2022,"Eurofragrance showcased its new Ecoconscious and Sensolab collections at In-cosmetics, a leading fair for personal care ingredients, held between April 5th and 7th in Paris. The collections focus on sustainability and innovation and align with the company’s strategic plan and are intended to answer current consumer desires.

The creative Sensolab collection offers new sensorial experience with its solid fragrance formats, made possible thanks to technological innovation. This eco-friendly collection is characterized by products that use less water or are water-free. These products require less packaging, are lighter and are responsible for lower carbon emissions thanks to improved shipping conditions.

The collection includes a body lotion stick fragranced with bergamot and cannabis notes that is easy to carry and use as a basic cosmetic; a water-free coffee and white flower scented solid conditioner and a powder shampoo with hints of apricot and carrot, that eliminates the need for water. Other products included are a pocket deodorant in a compact powder format and a bath confetti soap that brings playfulness to the shower, in a format that diffuses olfactive notes of mandarin.

The company also presented the Ecoconscious collection of vegan, sustainable fragrances with natural ingredients, formulated with some eco-certifiable ingredients.

The multinational revealed various applications created with L’Ame du Bois™, the first captive perfumery ingredient derived from wood waste and developed by Eurofragance in October 2021. It was introduced at in-cosmetics this April in the form of fine fragrances, a shampoo and a scented candle.

Being an important ingredient in its history, the company looked for a way to produce a natural extract from wood without deforestation or negatively impacting the environment, and did so by upcycling discarded sawdust from a particular tree. After a time consuming and repetitive purification process, they were able to uncover an ingredient with the best olfactory profile, while retaining the soul of the wood.

Olegario Monegal, Global Business Unit Director of Home and Personal Care, explains, “These two categories, ‘home’ and ‘personal care’ are booming in Europe. Our presence at in-cosmetics illustrates our particular desire to accelerate our growth in personal care. We have a palette of high-quality raw materials and an excellent level of customer service along with valuable market knowledge that make us ready to respond to new consumer demands.”",,[],[]

Diablo Immortal Battle Pass & Cosmetics Are Locked to One Character – Fans Demand Change,"Diablo Immortal players are unhappy with the game’s current system of locking all purchases of cosmetics to one character.

If you’ve been looking forward to playing Diablo on your mobile device, the good news is that Diablo Immortal is finally here. And for those of you that don’t have phones, Immortal is out on PC too.

It’s only been a few hours since launch and already many fans are claiming that Diablo Immortal is Pay-to-Win. And perhaps even more disappointingly, some of the content you pay for is locked to just one character.

Diablo Immortal Players Demand Account-Bound Cosmetics & Rewards

Diablo Immortal players are demanding that cosmetics and other rewards become account-bound rather than tied to one character.

Right now, when you buy a cosmetic pack in Diablo Immortal, you’re only buying access to that cosmetic for a single character. Should you want to equip the armor, weapon, or profile customization on another server or alt, you’ll need to purchase it again.

The same goes for the Diablo Immortal Battle Pass unlocks, strangely enough. While the pass will be available on your second character, it’ll be back at Tier 1 once more.

Even with our tricks to completing the Diablo Immortal Battle Pass in no time, that’s still quite the grind for unlocks that you’ve already made.

And since Diablo Immortal Season 2’s release date is just around the corner, some cosmetics will soon be unobtainable.

Blizzard Entertainment

Even the pre-registration rewards can only be claimed on a single character, so you’d better choose wisely.

“Cosmetics must be without any doubt account bound,” a popular post on the Diablo Immortal subreddit reads. “This means that every character of the same class, no matter the server you’re playing on can equip the armor, weapons, frames you bought. There’s no other way around this. Period.”

Why I'm Tracking My Beauty Waste This Earth Month,"This Earth Month, join us as we explore the personal steps and global movements that will work in tandem to keep our planet healthy. Because, as we know, the Earth’s well-being directly impacts our own. Read more

The global cosmetics industry creates over 120 billion units of packaging annually—and most of it isn't recyclable. Because trying new creams, serums, and sprays is part of my job as a beauty writer, I'm constantly seeing how unsustainable these products are, including the boxes they're shipped in and the product containers themselves.

This Earth Month, I made a pledge to try and make my beauty routine as sustainable as possible—but the first step was figuring out what changes I needed to make. To get started, I spent two weeks tracking my beauty waste. I realized that my waste falls into three main categories: mail packaging, single-use products, and empty containers. Breaking things down in this way has made it a lot easier for me to wrap my mind around the ways I can make my routine more sustainable. Read on for what I learned.

1. Managing mail packaging

Any time I'm out of town for more than a week, I come home to a mound of packages bigger than any Christmas I've ever had. It's equally as exciting as it is overwhelming because the waste this creates adds up quickly. Most of these contain boxes within boxes: the generic shipping-company box, then a pretty brand box, then tiny boxes with individual products. Sometimes, brands send these really elaborate packages that mean a single serum is shipped in a box big enough to house a pair of knee-high boots. And then there's the bubble wrap, packing peanuts, and paper confetti.

Related Stories

I recycle all of my boxes and know cardboard is something that's actually quite easy to dispose of sustainably, so I'm not overly concerned about the volume of boxes. But, there are definitely a few things that I wish were different about the packages I receive. First up is all the extras. Whether it be bubble wrap or metallic packing grass, there are some things that just can't be recycled, and I wish my mail was 100 percent plastic-free. Plus, nothing grinds my gears more than getting a box that's way bigger than the item inside, which happens quite often. Simply put, it's unnecessary.

On the left is a tiny product that came in a very large box. The right shows an appropriate-sized, well-packed box.

2. Taking stock of single-use products

Something I became hyper-aware of during this process is how many things I throw away during my daily routine. I've used reusable facial pads in lieu of cotton balls for years, so I thought I was doing well. But then I started to think about things like Q-tips, tissues, and alcohol pads. One thing I'm not about to do is invest in reusable Q-tips or blow my nose in reusable tissues, but I would still love to explore more sustainable options.

I've realized that my biggest issue is individually packaged alcohol pads— I use them a lot more than I'd realized. For example, I always use one to sanitize my beauty tech tools like microcurrent devices or LED light masks after every use. Plus, I do my own gel manicures every two to three weeks and use a few pads during that process. They come in paper envelopes lined with plastic, so I'm interested in finding a solution to cut down on this.

Although I don't go through them super quickly, I'd also love to find a sustainable solution to my makeup sponges. I end up getting a new one every two to three months and would love to find a less wasteful option.

3. Figuring out how to handle product containers

The hard thing about product containers is that they're often made of a mix of different types of plastic and metals, which makes them impossible to be recycled through municipal centers. I'm currently looking at a serum that comes in a glass bottle with a plastic pump and lid. The glass is likely recyclable, but only if I separate it from the pump and lid and rinse it out before putting it in the bin. The pump is likely just trash. Brands are working to make their packaging less complicated and more easily recyclable, but there's still a long way to go.

I end up with a lot of container waste, whether it be empty containers or products I used a few times and then realized I didn't like. I have a stockpile of empties in my closet that I've been holding on to because I know there are recycling options but I haven't actually done the research yet. I also need to figure out solutions for the products I've used but don't like. In some cases, I can gift them to friends. But sourcing a friend for every product I don't like is overwhelming, and I know there has to be a better solution.

Takeaways

As I go through this process, I'm very aware that I'm not going to save the world by making my beauty routine more sustainable. Most of the changes I'm looking to make won't make that mind-blowing of a difference. But, it's still something I'm committed to doing. I know that by being more mindful, I can make my beauty routine more sustainable, which is a step in the right direction.

The beauty industry’s dirty little secret,"Some brands are stepping in to address this issue by offering refill options – which is great if you’re talking bath, body and haircare, where it’s just a simple case of purchasing a pouch and then decanting it back into the original bottle back at home. (Diptyque, Kerastase and Ouai are just a few luxury brands offering these pouches while stores including L’Occitane and Kiehl’s have in-store refill stations.)

But with skincare – especially brands with “natural” claims – refillable often doesn’t work, thanks to the challenge of keeping ingredients in highly active formulas and avoiding the risk of developing bacteria.

An in-store refill station at L’Occitane. But not all beauty products can be decanted back into the original bottle.

“We need to ensure our ingredients remain safe from contamination because we avoid artificial preservatives,” says Tony Rechtman, chief executive of Total Beauty Network, which produces the natural makeup and skincare brand Inika Organic. “Our Organic Liquid Foundation, for example, requires airless packaging. Refill it and you’d let contaminants in.”

It’s a pain point for the brand, but where it does use plastic, it pays penance through a Plastic Neutral initiative. Meaning: “If we use five tonnes of PCR plastic, we will aim to collect five tonnes of plastic by the end of 2022 and recycle it, by working with Plastic Forests.”

Plastic Forests repurposes the plastic into fence posts that are then distributed by BlazeAid, a volunteer organisation that rebuilds in Australian communities affected by drought, fire and floods.

“It’s not perfect, but it’s a start,” says Rechtman.

TerraCycle ANZ boss Jean Bailliard commends Sukin for its transparency and commitment to becoming more sustainable.

Jean Bailliard is the general manager of TerraCycle Australia New Zealand, a global social enterprise that has programs in place to help consumers recycle all the empties that are never going to be accepted in kerbside collections.

Bailliard says most brands admit they’re not perfect and even if they can’t find a solution right now, they can still act ethically. “They just need to be transparent about the issues they’re facing and talk about their plans. Sukin is a great example of this. As a company, it is incredibly transparent and states it wants to be more sustainable but still has a long way to go. Its recycling program is one step in that process.”

Over the past few years, TerraCycle has been working with brands such as David Jones, Mecca and Maybelline (via Priceline), encouraging their customers to drop off their used bottles and packaging in store. This is then sent to TerraCycle’s warehouses, where it is sorted by waste stream, cleaned and converted into new raw materials that are used in anything “from outdoor furniture to decking to plastic shipping pallets”.

Recycling plastic is not a new concept but in the beauty industry’s case, it’s particularly complicated.

Bailliard says consumers will pay a premium for recyclable products (a TerraCycle survey last year found 90 per cent of consumers were willing) but feels the way forward is for brands to keep innovating.

“Toothpaste, for example, is a tough one, but what about looking at dry-powder formulas you mix with water? Consumers also need to ... consider new practices like paying a deposit for a product in a reusable container, which is refunded when you return the packaging, which is then professionally cleaned, refilled and returned to the shelf.

Chanel’s No. 1 nine-piece skincare, makeup and fragrance range is packaged in recyclable, lighter-weight glass with non-plastic lids.

“We’ve done this with our Loop program, which has been hugely successful worldwide and seen us partner with stores like Tesco in the UK and brands like Procter & Gamble and Unilever. Hopefully, we can establish Loop in Australia over the next few years.”

French fashion houses are also taking (smallish) strides to do their bit, recognising perhaps that every little effort adds up.

If a Dior or Hermès refillable lipstick doesn’t do it for you, consider instead Chanel’s just-launched No. 1 nine-piece skincare, makeup and fragrance range crafted from recyclable lighter-weight glass. It comes without explanatory leaflets (a QR code tells you everything you need to know instead) and lids composed of 90 per cent bio-sourced materials that include camellia-seed shells and wood shavings.

Some may see this latest launch as little more than glam greenwashing, but for others, it’s proof that aesthetics and ethics can go hand in hand. Baby steps, remember?",,[],['Eugenie Kelly']
Baralan strengthens ESG commitment as it celebrates 60 Years,"Baralan’s ESG strategy focuses on making meaningful sustainability advancements in two key areas: optimizing its packaging portfolio to reduce environmental footprint; and developing a holistic sustainability framework to guide a company-wide transformation over the medium and longer term. This includes specific initiatives like enhancing reusability and recyclability of products, optimizing waste by promoting more effective solutions such as airless packaging and prioritizing mono-material packaging. Moreover, the company has implemented tangible actions to encourage the adoption of alternative materials, such as biopolymers, and has developed new products using PCR materials in a series just launched earlier this year.

For Baralan, sustainability and sustainable development are, thus, concepts linked to an idea of circular economy that takes into account the quality of products, satisfying the needs between design and functionality, safeguarding and ensuring better conditions for products’ lifecycle. Sustainability is one of the key elements of Baralan’s strategy, who is committed daily to respond to the growing desire of consumers to find products that meet their expectations with particular ethical and environmental needs and that reflect their values.

“Throughout our 60-year history, we have perpetually evolved to address industry trends and market changes, allowing us to provide consistent strategic support for customers and partners,” said Caroline Baranes, Chief Marketing Officer. “Our strengthened ESG initiatives and sustainable solutions serve as both tools and guiding principles in our day-to-day operations, giving our teams a renewed sense of purpose to achieve a cleaner, more sustainable world for all.

Cosmetic textures: how IMCD plays with appearances,"Solid textures in all forms, waxes, powders, oily or aqueous emulsions… as naturalness and the search for more sustainable solutions became central to product development, cosmetic galenics gained much importance on the market. Indeed, if consumers look for natural and sustainable products, they are hardly willing to compromise on sensoriality, efficacy, and ease-of-use, which they got used to with modern cosmetics.

Trends that stimulate formulators’ creativity

“The natural origin index defined by standard ISO 16128 is one of our customers’ main criteria today. The percentage of ingredients of natural origin in a product has become a reference in cosmetics formulation”, confirms Anne-Sophie Gardes, EMEA Regional Technical Director Beauty & Personal Care at IMCD.

Anne-Sophie Gardes, IMCD

To play this game, cosmetic formulation laboratories have to prove extremely creative in combining ingredients that offer both high levels of naturalness and the efficacy and pleasure of use expected. And there is a segment where you can definitely not make any compromise: sun protection!

“When it comes to formulation, it is one of the trickiest categories today. You need to offer high protection levels, while meeting legitimate expectations as regards environmental protection and naturalness,” the scientist adds. Choices need to be made between the various filters available, depending on the protection spectrum wanted, the potential environmental impact, in particular on corals and marine organisms, local regulations, and brands’ “black lists”.

A sponsor of the Sensory Bar at the last in-cosmetics Global show in Paris, IMCD Beauty & Personal Care had chosen to put forward this creative challenge with two sun care formulas boasting both innovative and astonishing textures: Extra Fluid Sunscreen, a waterless fluid sunscreen, and Hydra Sun Pearls, solid pearls containing 33% of water to spread on the skin.

“We wanted to show that there can be a real gap between the look of formulas and their actual compositions. The former is milky, so it evokes an aqueous emulsion, and yet it is waterless. The latter is composed of small beads, so we expect an anhydrous formula with a lot of wax, but it actually contains water,” explains Anne-Sophie Gardes.

An anhydrous fluid sunscreen

For Extra Fluid Sunscreen, a body and face sunscreen with a 93.34% natural origin index, IMCD used the NIKKOL Nikkomulese WO-NS emulsifier, an optimized mixture of two emulsifying molecules and a structuring agent to obtain particle dispersion, while boosting the SPF. The silky texture was worked with emollients and a mattifying powder (GRANPOWDER BBP-700) to reduce the oily effect of oils.

Beeswax and a gelling rheology modifier (MIGLYOL GEL) also help maintain the zinc oxide (UV Cut ZnO-65-CC) in suspension. This mineral filter offers good UVB and UVA protection, so it makes it easier to create short formulas. The SPF value obtained in vitro reaches 51.4 (47.8 in vivo) for a UVA PF of 25.3.

“With this fluid formula, you get a sunscreen that is easy to apply and ideal for both the face and body. Zinc oxide provides excellent protection without leaving white traces, thanks to quality dispersion and to the synergy it creates with a specific association of ingredients.”

Solid pearls with high sensoriality

The Hydra Sun Pearls SPF 25 sun beads were designed to offer a monodose of protective hand care. Each bead melts in the hand to always deliver the same quantity of cream. Despite their solid form, these beads contain 33% of water, which provides them with a light, low-oil sensorial texture far from heavy butter- and wax-based formulas.

“Hand creams are increasingly claimed to offer an SPF. Here, it is a water-in-oil emulsion. The outer phase is oily, which makes the skin feel comfortable. The aqueous phase offers freshness and lightness,” emphasizes Anne-Sophie Gardes. “The monodose bead form helps reduce waste by delivering the right dose required for each use.”

Here, again, the main emulsifier is NIKKOL Nikkomulese WO-NS. It is completed with rice bran wax to provide structure and a zinc oxide dispersion (UV CUT ZnO-65 CC) to obtain the sun protection needed. The formula is free from chemical filters and titanium dioxide and the natural origin index reaches 99.35%.

This is outstanding evidence of the creative possibilities offered by the great variety of cosmetic ingredients now available on the market – even when trying to reach the highest naturalness percentage possible for formulas as sensitive as sunscreens!",,[],"['Meiyume Develops Exclusive Halal Sun Care Formulation For Carasun', 'Makeup Brushes', 'How To Go Even Further In Designing Eco Products Of Tomorrow']"

"Celebrity makeup artist Sir John on his new CCO role, makeup’s comeback and why he’s ‘anti-trend’","Known for his work on A-list clients like Beyonce, Karlie Kloss, Naomi Campbell and Kim Kardashian, makeup artist Sir John joined Ctzn Cosmetics as its new chief creative officer and board member in April. Sir John, who is also a creative director for L’Oréal Paris USA, is bringing his more than two decades of celebrity experience to the indie brand.

Also taking a seat on the board and equity in the brand, he will help lead product launches and strategies for growth.

Launched just over three years ago by co-founders and sisters Aleena, Aleezeh and Naseeha Khan, the brand is focused on products for underrepresented demographic groups and has garnered buzz for its diverse range of nude lipsticks. The lipstick especially saw a surge in October 2021, when beauty influencer Mikayla Nogueira reviewed the brand’s lipstick and influencer Erin Dugan stitched the review. The influx of traffic crashed the website for a period of time, and sales rose by more than 12,000% after her review was posted. According to Sir John, one of the goals for the brand will be to expand the cult appeal of the brand’s lipstick to other product categories including eyes and contour.

We caught up with Sir John to talk about his creative vision for Ctzn, his beauty inspirations and creative process, and his dedication to being “anti-trend,” when it comes to his approach to makeup.

How did you link up with the brand and how did the new role come about?

“I knew about the products for a while and about the universal range. I was introduced to one of the investors and I fell in love with the mission behind Ctzn, which is to lean into an inclusive landscape for the beauty community — making sure that everyone feels seen and heard, and that people felt like they’re on our radar when we’re manufacturing and designing products, from design to colors.… Beauty is a feeling, It’s not something you can always see.”

How does your background as a makeup artist inform product development?

“We’re on the front lines. We see so much. I get tons of boxes of everything daily.… I’ve been able and blessed to work in different genres, [including] red carpet, stadiums, Super Bowls and Coachellas, as well as cover stories in the editorial market. They are all completely different. That’s how the business has trained me to look at products: ‘Is it good?’ ‘Is not going to waste someone’s time?’ ‘Is it going to be too hard to use?’ Those are all the kinds of things clicking through my mind when I see a product.”

How much are you able to share about your creative vision for the brand going forward?

“Packaging is key. As we become more mature, we care more about the way something is constructed, the look and feel. And looking at Gen Z, they love to photograph things.”

How does this role compare to collabs you’ve done in the past?

“I love the stuff that I’ve done with Barbie. “The Lion King” collection was able to touch so many people and also gave me a connection to the South African market and the diaspora of Africa, in general. All of these things have really been beautiful feathers in my cap. What that allows me to do now is have informed decisions and know what we’re going into. The guesswork is gone.”

What have you seen at this point in the pandemic with makeup; has makeup made its big comeback?

“What the pandemic allowed us to do is look at our skin in a different way. We’re OK wearing less foundation. We’re OK with less coverage. But then there’s also this dichotomy where people want to have fun with it. Makeup is making a big comeback, it’s coming back, but [now it’s] a little bit more [about] looking inward: ‘How does this make me feel?'”

What trends from social media do you have your eye on?

“I don’t really believe in trends. I’m anti-trend and anti-celebrity, in a sense. Twenty years ago, even 10 years ago, it was always about what celebrities were wearing. What’s cool about now is that you can go right to the people: How do people want to look? Celebrities are not really influencing us the way they used to, but the people are influencing each other.”

Over the course of your career, how much has social media changed beauty?

“I’ll say it’s a gift and a curse, because the beautiful thing about social media — the democracy of it — is that people have voices. People want to feel seen and championed. Body positivity is because of social media. This inclusive landscape of beauty is because of social. If we were waiting on the fashion industry or the beauty industry, we would still be waiting for us to feel invited, or seen, or represented.

The not-so-bright side of our business is that social media can be harmful. It can induce anxiety and depression on a younger generation of people, on all of us. It’s important for us to make sure that we’re taking a second to check in, to do a temperature check. There should be some kind of reckoning to make sure we’re not making people feel like they shouldn’t look like themselves.”

Apart from Instagram, are you looking at other platforms?

Reusable wipes and skincare samples: 9 ways to reduce cosmetics waste,"I’ve often felt troubled by the amount of packaging in beauty products. Take, for example, skincare serum. It can be encased in an ornate bottle, which sits inside an elaborate box (and sometimes a box within a box), which is then wrapped in plastic.

The tiny amount of product versus the swathes of packaging it comes in is sometimes mind-boggling. Some may argue that beauty products are designed to pamper and make us feel a certain way, and hence packaging is important, but this comes at a cost to the environment.

I try to assuage my feelings of guilt by making sure I recycle all paper, plastic and glass packaging, but I’ve just learned, to my consternation, that very little beauty packaging is actually recycled.

Contemporary Danish fashion brand, Ganni, also utilises the Swansea based manufacturer’s eye-catching eco-friendly product display units in their stores across Scandinavia, London, Paris and Los Angeles.

Funds raised will support Smile Plastics in its international expansion alongside purchasing a factory in Swansea, additional machinery and expanding the team.

Smile Plastics follows a zero-waste production model and offers a buy-back scheme, providing a closed-loop full-circle ecosystem that keeps plastics out of landfill. The company’s aim is to challenge ideas about business waste and the system that creates it and manufacture and produce plastics made from 100% recyclable materials.

Smile currently delivers over 500 tonnes of CO2 savings per year when compared to the traditional way of making panels from virgin polymer. The panels are predominantly used in the hospitality and retail sectors, although there is a rapidly growing market for making furniture and other household items

The Green Angel Syndicate is a delivery partner of the Regional Angels Programme, which is operated by British Business Investments, a commercial subsidiary of the British Business Bank. The Regional Angels Programme seeks to reduce regional imbalances in access to early-stage equity finance.

It is the first Regional Angels Programme delivery partner specialising in the fight against climate change by only investing in companies whose technology and process innovations have the potential to reduce carbon or greenhouse gas emissions or to remove carbon from the atmosphere. The Regional Angels Programme will match funds raised via Green Angel Syndicate’s network of investors and their EIS Climate Change Fund.

Rosalie McMillan, Founding Director of Smile Plastics said:

“This investment is well timed to enable us to realise the rapid growth needed to meet the demand for our product in the UK and internationally. We’re proud to have GAS on board for the next stage of our journey.”

Circular Beauty Can End the Industry's Waste Problem,"One only has to look as far as their own bathroom vanity to know that the beauty industry has a sustainability problem—generating a cited 120 billion units of waste annually of mostly plastic. This ugly truth about the multibillion dollar sector comes along with a bevy of alarming consequences related to ingredient sourcing, environmentally hazardous formulations, and wasteful distribution. For years, the industry status quo has been to prioritize profits in the midst of staunch competition, with beauty brands rapidly launching new products to keep up with the pace of mercurial trends. We know we can't just recycle our way out of this mess.

But how's this for hope? The eponymously named, New Zealand–based, luxury green beauty brand founded by Emma Lewisham is officially the first in the world to model a solution. In an unprecedented move, the brand has achieved a 100 percent circular business model, complete with carbon positive status, defying the global beauty market's competitive environment by making the intellectual property public. ""We genuinely want to see change,"" Lewisham tells BAZAAR.com. ""The problems we face are so much greater than the success of one business or brand, and if we are going to solve them, collaboration is key. We must tear down the barriers of competition once and for all. … This has to be the future of beauty.""

This achievement garnered the written endorsement from Lewisham's lifelong hero, the world-renowned environmentalist, ethologist, and a United Nations Messenger of Peace, Dr. Jane Goodall . ""Emma Lewisham may be setting a new benchmark in beauty, but they are also setting a benchmark for how all industries should be operating—circular, waste free, and carbon positive. I wholeheartedly endorse Emma Lewisham's Beauty Circle and all the systems they have put in place as a business striving to make the world a better place,"" Goodall writes.

Emma Lewisham

What Is Circular Beauty?

The term refers to a green business model that keeps materials in use through repair and reuse, extends product life-cycle through quality, and purposely minimizes waste. ""The beauty industry is currently built around the linear economic model, where we take from the earth, make something, then consumers throw it away. This take-make-waste system is responsible for an unprecedented amount of waste,"" Lewisham says. ""It may be appeasing profits, but it isn't supporting the one thing we cannot live without: Earth.""

Being the first luxury beauty brand to achieve a circular model including carbon positivity meant undergoing an extensive process of research and development, collaborating with independent environmental organization agencies like Toit ū Envirocare to track their carbon emissions at each stage of production. ""It has been the result of many years of hard work and dedication by our team to get to this point,"" she says. ""Our circularity journey has been underway since inception and has been a labor of love and tenacity."" She adds that this meant investing heavily into the research and development of packaging, machinery, and business processes to allow for every product to be refilled, kept in use, and out of landfills.

Reusable, Refillable Packaging

Achieving circularity relied heavily upon innovating packaging. ""The single largest contributor of carbon emissions in the beauty industry is single-use packaging,"" she says. ""In mapping our carbon emissions, we have been able to prove that when buying our circularly designed refills—as opposed to brand-new packaging—carbon emissions are reduced by up to 74 percent."" It is important to Lewisham that we understand the significance of reusing packaging, via endlessly refillable containers, as opposed to recycling. ""While recycling is part of circularity, reuse must always come first,"" she notes. ""Typically, refilling requires significantly less energy and resources, therefore emitting less greenhouse gases.""

More importantly, she points out that beauty recycling is not as streamlined of a process as we would like to believe. She notes that the recycling of beauty packaging requires specialized systems; it is simply not possible through typical curbside pickups. ""Unless someone is prepared to cover the cost of having it recycled, it ends up either in landfills, scattered through our oceans, or burnt into greenhouse gases,"" Lewisham explains. ""If brands are to rely on the recyclability of their packaging, it is essential that they take responsibility for ensuring that it is actually recycled.""

Further, the skincare entrepreneur is calling for an end to single-use beauty packaging. ""After all, why would you invest time and resources into producing something that is inherently designed to be thrown away?"" she asks. ""And economically, surely, we should be reusing materials that we have invested in producing as opposed to sending them and their inherent value straight to a landfill.""

Emma Lewisham

Carbon Positivity

Yet another aspect of Lewisham's achievement has been going beyond carbon neutrality by becoming certified carbon positive. Carbon neutral is a status brands achieve when they track their carbon emissions (caused by resource use in production, transportation, creation, et cetera), and then removing the equivalent amount of carbon from the atmosphere, often through financial donations to offsetting agencies. But being carbon positive—also known as ""carbon negative"" or ""climate positive"" depending on the certifying agency—indicates that the brand is taking more carbon emissions out of the atmosphere than it puts in.

""To become certified carbon positive, we worked with Toitū Envirocare, who are a world-leading independent environmental certification agency,"" Lewisham says. ""Over 12 months, we measured the carbon emissions emitted at each stage of our products' life cycles, including growing, harvesting, transportation, product packaging, and end of life. This allowed us to clearly see where we could reduce carbon emissions and enabled us to implement an extensive carbon-reduction strategy as a first point of call."" It took work, but it created a new baseline of eco-responsibility for beauty brands to aspire to.

Collaboration over Competition

The final step of Lewisham's planet-friendly commitment has been making the fruits of their extensive labor—the —public for other brands to follow suit. ""Sharing our Beauty Blueprint wasn't a decision I made lightly, as it is undoubtedly one of our brand's competitive advantages,"" Lewisham says. ""However, none of it matters unless other brands join us on a circular and carbon positive path. … I hope that by sharing our Beauty Blueprint, other brands can capitalize on our innovation and investment to accelerate their transition to a circular and carbon positive model.""

Poignantly, Lewisham points out that alone, the brand cannot hope to achieve the true shifts in the industry that she passionately hopes will come to pass for the sake of her young daughter. Her belief in the power and importance of collaboration is yet another area where Goodall commends the beauty entrepreneur. ""I admire Emma Lewisham's passion for creating lasting change,"" Goodall writes. ""Sharing their sustainability IP industry-wide is a powerful step, and I urge all brands to follow their lead. … This is when true change begins—when we work together.""

Emma Lewisham

Voting with Your Dollars

In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that human-wrought climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases was already ""irreversible"" for centuries to come, causing U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres to deem the IPCC's findings ""a code red for humanity."" Experts urged steps to limit greenhouse gas emissions in order for global temperatures to stabilize in two to three decades. How? By voluntarily prioritizing elements of inclusive and green economies—models characterized by low carbon emissions and efficient resource usage, and that are socially inclusive; in other words, circular.

As beauty consumers, we can take steps to consume less, waste less, reuse packaging (or recycle it responsibly). But for the purchases we do make, we can also vote with our dollars by supporting environmentally responsible brands that put their values into concrete actions. ""New Zealand beauty brand Emma Lewisham is demonstrating what it means to be a truly sustainable business,"" Goodall writes. ""Through their carbon positive and circular business model, Emma Lewisham is creating environmental prosperity and showing their peers that this business model is not just possible but paramount if we are to make a meaningful difference.""

Amber Heard testifies makeup presented in court was not the one she used,"The defamation trial between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is back in session, with Heard taking the witness stand this week.

In addition to Heard's alleged apparent defecation in their shared bed and Depp's finger injury, Heard's alleged use of a specific brand/type of makeup to cover injuries received at the hands of Depp has been a hot topic of conversation.

Elaine Bredehoft, Heard's lawyer, expressed the following sentiments while holding up the Milani Cosmetics All-In-One Correcting Kit on an April date in the ongoing trial. ""This is what Amber carried in her purse for the entire relationship with Johnny Depp. She's an actor, do you honestly think she would have left her apartment ever without makeup?""

Milani didn't waste any time in revealing that the kit in question did not exist at the time of the relationship because it didn't debut until 2017. People continued to speculate on social media that Heard was lying about several aspects of her testimony after that.

Heard held up the Milani kit in question in court today, but revealed that it wasn't the actual kit she used at the time - despite the fact that this wasn't revealed when her lawyer first held up the concealer, or at any other point in the case until now.

A very intense morning in the trial of Depp vs Heard

Amber Heard tells jury Depp hallucinated at end of marriage, denies poop accusation

The highly-publicized trial, which resumed Monday after a week-long break, has been live-streamed from a courtroom in Fairfax, Virginia, on the Law & Crime Network YouTube channel and other outlets since mid-April.

Depp allegedly grabbed a phone from Heard's hand, screamed ""really nasty stuff"" at one of her friends, and then threw the phone at Heard's face in ""what felt like her eye"" during the fight leading up to the incident, according to Heard.

During two separate 9-11 calls on May 21, 2016, the same day Heard claimed Depp threw a phone at her face, multiple police officers testified they did not see any injuries on Heard and were unable to determine if a crime had occurred. Heard was also uncooperative with the cops, according to the officers.

When asked why she refused to cooperate with the police, Heard stated that she ""wanted to protect Johnny.""

At the time of publication, Heard is still testifying.",,[],[]
Going green becomes mainstream in European beauty market,"25-May-2022

On May 8, 2022, the third offline event of BeautySourcing’s premium suppliers drew to a satisfactory close. Over the three days, the BeautySourcing Marketplace had attracted a large number of professional buyers coming from Germany and beyond

With the help of the O2O business model, these buyers could not only see things but also feel, smell, touch samples and even try them out. They came to find new impulses and inspiration, explore new products and discover new trends. Admittedly, due to the pandemic, this event could not be comparable to previous editions in terms of size and number of visitors. But this event showed a sign of a basically rapid recovery of German beauty market. This year, besides big manufacturers, many small-size brands have emerged. Most of them are established by online celebrities and cover a wide range of categories including makeup tools, coloured cosmetics, nails, perfume and beauty device, etc.

During the show, 428 buyers showed their strong interest in 378 samples from BeautySourcing’s 32 partner suppliers. These buyers mainly came from northern, central and southern Europe. Few of them came from Turkey, India and other countries and regions. Looking from the nature of them, 33% of the buyers were local European producers looking for suppliers, 24% were brands and 13% were distributors and agents.

What trends and innovations did we identify at the show:

Packaging suppliers sourcing trends: new materials and new formats especially with the refillable aspect of beauty, biodegradable packaging material (PLA, Bamboo, Coffee Ground)

It is a truth that today most beauty packaging is still single-use and ultimately goes into landfills. As brands and consumers become increasingly eco-conscious, packaging suppliers pay high attention to the recycling, refillable and even biodegradable possibilities. Thus, clean beauty, natural cosmetics and sustainability became the focus of the event. The event showed that packaging suppliers tried to use recyclable materials and refillable systems to reduce the packaging waste. Moreover, PLA, bamboo, coffee grounds offered a renewable, compostable and biodegradable option for packing cosmetics. The on-site activities reflected that suppliers were scrambling to dabble into these directions to make their packaging more eco-friendly.

Home beauty device incorporate multiple functions into one tool, creating healthy and natural results.

Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, people’s demands for self-care treatments at home rapidly grow. At the event, the home beauty device also became a focus. The manufacturers and brands worldwide sought to present their innovative designs to meet the at-home self-care demands. Their at-home beauty device covered various application scenes, including acne treatment, hair growth or hair removal, cleaning tools, skin care and rejuvenation, among others. For numerous scenes, high technologies hold the key to treatment functions. Advanced technologies including radiofrequency, LED light therapy, laser, galvanic current, vibration therapy, microdermabrasion and microcurrent make it possible for people to enjoy their facial treatments as effectively and safely as they do in salons. Some of these technologies are integrated into one device to create multiple results.

RF face massage device from HIEE is a tend following example. It incorporates RF, EMS, EP, ION, VIB , LED into the device. Multi-pole RF radio frequency could effectively activate skin and help to ensure skin elasticity. EMS microcurrent tightens and lifts the facial skin. The ion introduces nutrients and helps skin care effectively absorb ingredients. The LED lights have different wave lengths and create different treatment: red helps skin restore vitality and elasticity while blue creates skin oil and moisture balance. The 316 Stainless steel, 24k golden plated energy contacts enhance treatment effect.

Another example is Hongwang Nicemay’s RF eye massager with EMS function. The device integrates with radio frequency, EMS and photon therapy functions with 4D treatment heads. It can perfectly satisfy those who have eye skin rejuvenation and anti-wrinkle needs. But don't just think of it as an eye massager. It can be applied to the whole face. With such a portable device, users can enjoy a facial massage anywhere they want.

All in all, BeautySourcing, as a professional vertical platform in beauty industry, will continue to discover and share region-specific beauty trends and innovations. Find more information: beautysourcing.com

Garance Doré's Skin Care Line Is French Beauty Reimagined,"When you think of French beauty, what comes to mind? The oft-discussed concept usually conjures images of minimalist creams that yield serious moisture, well-coiffed women with immaculate skin (and probably a red lip), and pharmacies lined with glass-bottled products all housing the secret to eternal youth. While a moisturizer that makes you forever 21 (or even 41, for that matter) is still more magic than real-life science, Garance Doré’s skin care line and its pragmatic approach to French beauty might just be the next best thing — it’s certainly the next big thing, in any case. The original French-girl influencer’s debut skin care line, two years in the making, is built around her love for simplicity, reverence for nature, and a commitment to streamlined routines even maximalists will appreciate.

Developed alongside her longtime business partner, Emily Yeston, Doré’s eponymous line is like the influencer’s ethos distilled into a trio of highly effective formulas. “Emily and I had felt for a long time that our skin was exhausted from trying so many products with highly active ingredients from our extensive beauty closets,” Doré explains to TZR. “We both had loved the simplicity and efficacy of French pharmacy products for a long time but realized that a lot of the classics we loved were full of ingredients that didn’t meet our standard of clean.” That’s how Doré and Yeston developed the idea for the line, combining their respective skills to create products they would actually want to use themselves.

“When used consistently,” Doré says, “the simplicity of a Doré routine powered with the gentleness and hydrating properties of our products create the foundation for fantastic skin.” With each thoughtfully-designed piece made right in France, the Doré line and its kelly-green packaging is one you’re sure to see cropping on the bathroom counters and in the medicine cabinets of celebrities, influencers, and friends alike.

Though launching with just three products, this initial Doré drop has virtually everything needed to form the core of a robust, universal morning and evening skin care routine. First up in the new collection is the aptly-named Le Cleanser (you must use a French accent every time you say it, by the way), a smart gel-to-milk face wash that utilizes the astringent, acne-clearing properties of witch hazel leaf water with naturally illuminating white lily extract and free radical-neutralizing goji berry extract.

With the face cleansed but not stripped, skin is primed to drink in Le Crème, a thick, luxurious-feeling moisturizer. The most indulgent product in the bunch Le Crème and its star ingredients, marine algae and hyaluronic acid, envelope the skin in hydration but doesn’t feel too heavy for daytime wear or sensitive skin in general.

Finally, Le Baume might be the most versatile pick in the lineup. One of those true goes-everywhere products, it’s a nourishing multiuse salve comprised of key ingredients castor oil, aloe vera, and vitamin E that soothe and heal dry skin, knicks, and chapped skin all over.

Doré

“French girl beauty to us is about cultivating confidence,” Doré explains. “When a French woman finds a product she loves, and she knows will work, she’s not going to waste her time looking for the next best thing — there is a practice of consistency and simplicity.” But it’s about more than just great products for the founder. “There’s also something quite special about the experience of French women passing their beauty traditions on to their daughters, nieces, sisters. There is a true sense of lineage, and we are excited to share that with our community with Doré.”

Create Less Waste With These 9 Reusable and Refillable Beauty Products,"It’s getting easier and easier to swap out common products with reusables – coffee cups, straws, and produce bags among them – but what about the things we can’t so easily replace? Like the bottles, jars, and jugs that hold our lotion and soap?

Many cosmetics brands tout the recyclability or biodegradability of their packaging – sometimes with a fair amount of greenwashing involved – but recycling alone isn’t a viable solution to our global waste problem; since 1950, less than 10% of plastic produced has actually been recycled, and, according to waste-management company TerrraCycle, the cosmetics industry itself produces an estimated 120 billion units of disposable packaging annually.

In the midst of this plastic-pollution crisis, companies are stepping in and making reusable and refillable cosmetics available to customers, so we can continue to care for (and sometimes pamper) ourselves without the same environmental cost.

Refillable Deodorant

Those plastic, twist-up deodorant tubes are becoming a thing of the past. Instead, household-name and small brands alike are offering refillable options.

Proverb’s aluminum-free deodorant refills are available in different colors, scents, and strengths, and are wrapped in paper. With their aluminum refillable pods, Grove Collaborative bypasses plastic and aims to be completely plastic-free by 2025. Haeckels also sells reusable aluminum cases, and their products are made with just eight sustainable ingredients, all sourced from suppliers within 2km of the company. For a discrete case to keep in your bag all day, try Fussy, whose compostable refill packaging is also made from sugarcane pulp. Humankind refills are made from cardboard and plastic, which can be recycled, and customers can also pay a small monthly fee to help offset their impact through the company’s ocean-plastic-removal offset program.

Conventional brands are hopping on the trend too; Dove, Secret, and Old Spice now sell reusable cases and deodorant refills.

Washable Cotton Rounds

Instead of buying those mega-packs of cotton pads from the beauty aisle, try washable cotton rounds instead. Use them to apply liquid products like micellar water, face wash, or toner, or swap out products that come as saturated wipes – like makeup remover – with the liquid form of the product to apply with these reusable pads.

LastRound – available at the Package Free Shop – come in a cute dispenser for your bathroom cabinet and are machine washable. The Versed Skincare cotton rounds come with a mesh bag for washing too; place used pads in the bag before putting in the washing and drying machine with your other laundry. Beauty brands Paula’s Choice, Garnier, Sephora, and Cocokind all have their own reusable rounds as well.

Refillable Skin Care Products

Brands large and small are coming up with solutions for the small, single-use plastic bottles, jars, and tinctures that store our favorite skin care products.

Based in Nashville, The Good Fill has its own in-person fillery, but you don’t need to be a Tennessean to use their products. Their orderable refill pouches for skincare products are made with 93% less plastic than the bottle, and are then mailed back to the company to be reused. Youth to the People products can also be refilled, and subscribers can save $10 on each refill.

Tata Harper takes a different approach with their silicone-free Water-Lock Moisturizer; refill pods come in recyclable packaging and lock into the original container. To refill the foaming facial cleansers from Zyderma, order their glass vials of the concentrated product to dilute with water and use as normal. Yves Saint Laurent also offers refills for their Pure Shots Perfect Plumper Face Cream, as does Rihanna’s Fenty Skin for a number of products from facial sunscreen to body scrub.

Silicone Sheet Masks

Popping on a sheet mask makes any night in feel like a luxury, but these single-use products inevitably end up in the trash. Pamper yourself without the waste with a reusable sheet mask to hold your favorite skincare products closer to the face for better absorption. The Honest Beauty silicone sheet mask is a go-to for skin care gurus; apply skincare products – or make your own mask concoctions, like these oatmeal-based masks – before setting the mask on your face. Rinse after each use and store for your next night of pampering.

Reusable Eye Masks

Eye masks work much the same as face masks by trapping in product for better absorption. The silicone Diex Forever Eye Mask targets the area under your eyes to hold your favorite eye creams and serums close the skin (it also comes in a super cute case). These masks sell out quickly, but Pacifica also has an affordable and effective reusable eye mask, available at Target.

Refillable Makeup

Who knew makeup could be refillable? These brands are tackling the task of waste-free beauty. Plus, refills are often much cheaper than the original product, so choosing a sustainable option will save you money in the long run.

Guerlain, Fenty Beauty, and Dior all offer refill tubes for their lipstick, as well as Hourglass, which sells refills for their highly-rated eyeshadow palettes too. Glossier Monochromes eyeshadow trio compacts also have refills in 10 different shades than can easily pop in and out of the original container. Kjaer Weis is among the most refill-friendly brands, with 100% recyclable and compostable packaging for their refillable concealer, mascara, blush, brow gel, eye shadow, eye pencils, bronzer, highlighter, and lipstick, with complete instructions for refilling.

Silicon Swaps

For all of your swabbing needs, ditch the multi-hundred packs from the drugstore and opt for these silicone alternatives. Try the popular LastSwab from LastObject, or snag an affordable multi-pack from Walmart. Wash the swap with soap and warm water after each use and store in the included case.

Refillable Hair Products

Along with plastic-free shampoo and conditioner bars, some companies are offering another low-waste alternative to traditional hair-care. Love Beauty and Planet products are vegan, cruelty free, and contain no dyes or parabens, and they offer 32oz refills, as does Ouai for their shampoo and conditioner for fine, medium, and thick hair types. Natura 300ml refills give you great bang for your buck on their many shampoo and conditioner products too.

Refillable Soap

With all that COVID-conscious hand washing, you might go through a bottle of hand soap faster than you can replace it. Check out ESPA and buy a reusable pump bottle to fill from their refill bags of hand and body soap, as well as shampoo, conditioner, hand cleanser, and lotion. The Follain Everything Soap is great for dogs, clothes, counters, and hands alike; snag their small glass bottles to fill from a larger refill jug. Bathing Culture’s cute glass jars can also be refilled from their one-gallon body wash bottles, or visit one of their refill locations in California.

Takeaways From Tacking My Waste as a Beauty Writer,"This Earth Month, join us as we explore the personal steps and global movements that will work in tandem to keep our planet healthy. Because, as we know, the Earth’s well-being directly impacts our own. Read more

When I started my career in beauty, receiving sparkly new products was the highlight of the job. And while getting my hands on the newest serums, foundations, and conditioners is still exciting, I'm now hyper-aware of the waste that comes as a result of the entire process. For example, when I asked a brand for one product to test, they sent me three additional products that I couldn't even use because they didn't align with my skin type. And don't even get me started on all the packaging.

I realize that I can't change the beauty industry—and testing products will always, in some way, be a part of my job—but I can change my practices. After spending two weeks tracking my trash and consulting a sustainability expert about how I could change my habits, I've found some tangible, actionable ways to do better.

1. Managing my stash

Even if writing about beauty wasn't my job, I'd probably still own far too many products. But tuning into my waste habits made me realize that I need to be more judicious about how much *stuff* comes into my collection—which means saying no to samples. I already have a pretty solid stash, which I can be better about shopping for both my personal use and for article inspiration. For fellow beauty lovers out there, it's important to stay on top of what you've got, and make sure you're not holding onto more you can actually use (beauty products do expire, after all).

Related Stories

I'm in the unique position of having to test products pretty regularly, and admittedly not all of what I sample earns a permanent spot on my shelf. However, thanks to sustainability expert Jhánneu Roberts, I now know that I can be more creative in the ways I use these products. For example, a face cream that I've used a few times but don't love can be repurposed as a hand cream, lipstick can become the perfect creamy blush, and leftover shampoo and conditioner make for A+ shaving cream alternatives.

2. Getting rid of excess the right way

Certain elements of my beauty routine will inevitably wind up as waste, but I now know that there are smarter ways to handle the excess.

There are some disposable items in my regimen that I can't part with—like tissues, makeup sponges, and cotton swabs. Instead of using the traditional versions of these things that go straight into the trash when I'm done using them, I've realized that swapping in recyclable options allows for a more sustainable alternative: composting.

Before the challenge, I was already using tissues made from recycled paper and plastic-free cotton swabs, but I always through them in the garbage. Now, I've decided to repurpose the trash can under my vanity strictly for compostable items, like cardboard, tissues, cotton swabs, and compostable beauty sponges. Not only does this keep these items separate from my actual trash so that I can easily add them to my kitchen compost pile (which I compost through SmartCompost.nyc), but it also makes me more mindful of how much actual trash I create and so that I can continue to cut back.

Then, there are the empties. I've long known that municipal centers can't recycle most beauty containers because they're made of mixed plastic, but that retailers like Nordstrom and Credo Beauty have programs that allow you to drop off empties for proper disposal. Instead of doing this, though, I've typically just let them accumulate in my closet... which is better than throwing them in the trash, but still isn't great. My 2-week waste experiment put a fire under me to finally get rid of them the right way, and the process was incredibly easy. I just walked into my local Nordstrom, found the BEAUTYCYCLE box in the beauty department, and dropped off my empties.

3. Staying mindful

The most important thing I learned throughout this process is that being more sustainable all comes down to mindfulness. While being completely zero-waste is impossible (for me, at least), paying closer attention to my habits has made a real difference in the amount of waste I create. And while the choices I make won't single-handedly change the world, they're a small step toward making it better.

Taking stock of my beauty waste and figuring out ways I can change it has been truly eye-opening, and made me more conscious of where I can improve in other facets of my life. If you're interested in doing the same, I promise it will be worth it.

"Deadly Pathogens Travel From Land to Sea on Microplastics, Study Finds","3 Mins Read

There’s another case for reducing plastic waste—scientists have discovered that microplastic can carry diseases from land to sea.

The findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports, are the first to connect microplastics in oceans to land-based pathogens. The researchers also found that contaminated plastic can concentrate in areas already contaminated with plastic waste.

“It’s easy for people to dismiss plastic problems as something that doesn’t matter for them, like, ‘I’m not a turtle in the ocean; I won’t choke on this thing,’” study author Karen Shapiro, an infectious disease expert and associate professor in the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, said in a statement. “But once you start talking about disease and health, there’s more power to implement change. Microplastics can actually move germs around, and these germs end up in our water and our food.”

The findings

The researchers created sea-like environments in a lab, looking to see if select pathogens were adhering to microplastics—particles smaller than five millimeters—namely polyester microfibers in clothing and fishing nets, and polyethylene microbeads in cosmetics.

Parasites were more present on microfibers than microbeads, but both carried pathogens. The researchers found plastic made it easier for the pathogens to come in contact with sea life whether the plastic floated or sank. Those that float are capable of traveling long distances. Those that sink can concentrate on the sea floor putting filter-feeders at risk.

“When plastics are thrown in, it fools invertebrates,” Shapiro said. “We’re altering natural food webs by introducing this human-made material that can also introduce deadly parasites.”

The researchers looked specifically at three pathogens: Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium (Crypto), and Giardia—all of which are recognized by the World Health Organization as causes of illness related to the consumption of shellfish.

Deadly threats

T. Gondii is a parasite that’s also found in cat excrement and linked to the spread of toxoplasmosis. According to the researchers, the parasite has been linked to sea otter death as well as the death of critically endangered wildlife including Hawaiian monk seals and Hector’s dolphins. The pathogen is also harmful to humans, causing life-long illnesses including reproductive and developmental disorders.

Both crypto and giardia can cause gastrointestinal diseases. For young children and those with compromised immune systems, the infection can be deadly.

“This is very much a problem that affects both humans and animals,” said the study’s lead author Emma Zhang, a fourth-year veterinary student with the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. “It highlights the importance of a One Health approach that requires collaboration across human, wildlife and environmental disciplines. We all depend on the ocean environment.”

The findings come on the heels of a study that found microplastics in the Arctic for the first time.

“This work demonstrates the importance of preventing sources of microplastics to our oceans,” said co-author Chelsea Rochman, a plastic-pollution expert and assistant professor of ecology at the University of Toronto. “Mitigation strategies include filters on washing machines, filters on dryers, bioretention cells or other technologies to treat stormwater, and best management practices to prevent microplastic release from plastic industries and construction sites.”

In March, U.N. member nations adopted a resolution to curb plastic waste globally. By the end of 2024, an international committee will set the treaty’s terms. The move was hailed as ‘historic’ by Inger Andersen, executive director of UN Environment Program. “It is an insurance policy for this generation and future ones, so they may live with plastic and not be doomed by it.”

"‘Measured, tracked and validated’: Estée Lauder outlines ‘green score’ tool for beauty","Published in the Royal Society of Chemistry​​, Estée Lauder executives, scientists and several external sustainability specialists outlined how the beauty major had applied green chemistry principles to its raw material selection and product formulation processes via a “quantitative green chemistry scoring methodology”.​

The methodology, or framework, they said, enabled Estée Lauder to provide a ‘green score’ for cosmetic and personal care products, ingredients and formulations and therefore conduct a “rapid assessment” ​by following a “hazard-based approach”​ that considered several human health, ecosystem health and environmental endpoints.

“The current approach advances the organisation’s sustainability goals in a way that can be transparently measured, tracked and validated,”​ the study authors wrote. “With this data-driven approach comes the opportunity to proactively guide the supply chain and strengthen green-chemistry-inspired formulation above and beyond regulations.”​

Tools like this, they said – based in green chemistry principles – could assist in “harmonising sustainability goals” ​and provide a “quantitative approach to make decisions and measure progress”.​

Measuring ‘green chemistry performance’​

To develop the ‘green score’, the study authors said ingredient and chemical component data were obtained from manufacturers, open-source databases and computer model estimates across eight metrics: acute, ocular, and dermal toxicity in human health; bioaccumulation, persistence, and aquatic toxicity in ecosystem health; and feedstock sourcing and greenhouse gas emissions for environmental endpoints. These metrics were then examined, averaged by category, or further averaged to an overall ‘green score’.

The Green Score tool's eight evaluation metrics [Image: Estée Lauder Companies]

Because scores and statistical results could be viewed at the ingredient, formula and product subcategory level, they said the tool could be used as a “measure of green chemistry performance”. ​Estée Lauder said it also offered a complementary hazard-based scoring system to the company’s existing risk-based safety program to ensure a “conservative view on ingredient selection and formula creation”, ​enabling priority raw materials for replacement to be identified.​

“…The tool includes several important features: (1) a balance between assessing inherent chemical and supply chain hazards, (2) a disincentive to use raw materials with low scores or lack of data by weighting their impact to reduce the score further, and (3) a certainty score to provide insight on the level of confidence in the Green Score for a given ingredient or chemical component,” ​they said.

Directing ‘reactive’ formulation and innovation​

Beyond this, the tool could, importantly, inform innovation decisions and guide response to regulatory constraints or actions, the authors said.

“By utilising the tool throughout the product development cycle (e.g. from ingredient functional class to product category and product form) the framework provides formulators with the technical agility required to shape formulation decisions and embeds green chemistry into decision-making,” ​they wrote.

“Key innovation opportunities”​ could also be focused on, given certain product forms scored higher than others, they said.

“With every improvement made by the Green Score, the tool itself will also be updated to further incentivise substitution by modifying default scores as well as the criteria set for penalties. By taking such a dynamic approach in evolving the tool, we can ensure that feedback loops are in place to improve scores across the entire product portfolio while staying ahead of and pre-empting reactive reformulation triggered by regulatory action.”​

The future? Wider data, better supply chain reporting​

Because the current framework strived for “data transparency and verifiability”,​ the team said not all possible human health, ecosystem health and environmental endpoints of concern had been included due to “limited data available”​. Similarly, not all 12 principles of green chemistry had been accounted for in the tool, for the same reasons, they said.

“However, with improvements in testing and modelling methods, data availability, and broader regulatory review, additional human health or ecosystem endpoints such as endocrine disruption could be added. For supplier data, future development and standardisation of supply chain reporting and frameworks may allow for inclusion of additional environmental endpoint data, such as manufacturing waste generation and use of hazardous process chemicals.”​

“… While the Green Score will be continuously improved to incorporate new data from regulators and suppliers, the current version is a transparent and robust tool to inform formulator decision-making, communicate expectations with suppliers, and prioritise raw materials, product types and product forms for reformulation. [The] Estée Lauder Companies will use the Green Score across its operations to guide future innovation for greener alternatives,”​ the study authors said.

Scoring Beauty's Eco Value Earlier this year, a group of beauty majors kickstarted the EcoBeautyScore Consortium​ that aimed to establish a brand-agnostic and transparent global environmental impact scoring system by the end of the year. Henkel, L’Oréal, LVMH, Natura &Co and Unilever had spearheaded the formation, and The Estée Lauder Companies was one of the other heavyweights backing the consortium, along with Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson & Johnson and Shiseido, among others.

The Best Zero Waste Makeup of 2022,"We independently research, test, review, and recommend the best products—learn more about our process. If you buy something through our links, we may earn a commission.

For long, the gold standard of a beauty box was lilliputian brochures, marvelous coffrets and reams of diaphanous wrapping. Tucked in its belly was usually a tiny (or a large) container, oftentimes made of plastic.

The cosmetic industry for decades has been notorious for producing waste, especially tons of plastic waste. Compounding this issue, only a miniscule 9% of the billions of tons of plastic produced globally is recycled. But now, consumers are demanding better alternatives, and some brands are stepping up to the challenge. They’re conscious of not only what goes in the bottle, but also the whole packaging caboodle.

To navigate the zero-waste universe, we checked in with Kathryn Kellogg, author of 101 Ways to Go Zero Waste and founder of Going Zero Waste. “Beauty products are notoriously difficult to recycle,” says Kellogg. What you should really keep an eye out for, she says are ""products that you can upcycle (unleash your DIY skills by turning glass beauty pots into candles), refill schemes and products with extended producer responsibility, for instance, where brands have partnered with recycling companies such as TerraCycle or take back the packaging.”

"Pope praises wrinkles, criticizes obsession with looking ‘forever young’","Pope Francis waves as he leaves his general audience in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican June 8, 2022. (Credit: Paul Haring/CNS.)

ROME — Why are the elderly unappreciated and seen as useless when they carry so much wisdom about life and can open the door to God’s tenderness, Pope Francis asked.

Criticizing the obsession of trying to stay forever young in appearance, he said people must not hide or try to get rid of their wrinkles.

“Wrinkles are a sign of experience, a sign of life, a sign of maturity, a sign of having made a journey. Do not touch them to become young, that your face might look young,” the pope said June 8 at his weekly general audience in St. Peter’s Square.

“What matters is the entire personality; it’s the heart that matters, and the heart remains with that youth of a good wine — the more it ages the better it is,” he said to applause.

The pope continued his series of talks about old age by looking at St. John’s account of Nicodemus (Jn 3:1-21). Jesus tries to explain to the elderly Pharisee about the need to be born again.

Jesus says that to see the kingdom of God, one needs to be “born from above,” which means “a rebirth from above with the grace of God” and not to be “reborn physically” as if this life had been a waste of time or a “failed experiment” that needed to be erased and done over, the pope said.

“This life is precious in God’s eyes — it identifies us as beings who are loved tenderly by God,” the pope said.

Jesus’ encounter with Nicodemus has something to teach people today, who, like Nicodemus, misunderstand what “rebirth” is and should be in the light of faith, he said.

Today, he said, there is a “dream of an eternal youth” and a “myth that makes us want to return to our mother’s womb to come back always with a young body.”

The world, which shows “a worrisome tendency to consider the birth of a child as the simple matter of the production and biological reproduction of the human being,” also cultivates this “myth of eternal youth as the desperate obsession with an incorruptible body,” he said.

Technology has stepped in to help so that, while people await “the defeat of death, we can keep the body alive with medicine and cosmetics which slow down, hide, erase old age,” he added. “So much makeup, so many surgical interventions to appear young.”

“Feeding the myth of eternal youth” should not be confused with the laudable effort of staying healthy and promoting one’s well-being, he said.

The pope quoted the Italian actress, Anna Magnani, who said, “Please don’t retouch my wrinkles. It took me so long to earn them.”

There is a mission proper to old age, he said, which is to help show people the hope and love that come with “being destined for eternity in God” and journeying toward one’s final destination with the wisdom of lived experience.

Being old is not an obstacle “to the being born from above that Jesus speaks of, but it becomes the opportune time to illuminate it” and make it credible to others, the pope said.

The kind of tenderness grandparents show their grandchildren “opens the door toward understanding God’s tenderness,” he said, “and old age helps us understand this aspect of God who is tenderness.”

He said people should question why “this throwaway culture decided to throw out the elderly, considering them useless.”

“The elderly are the messengers of the future, the elderly are the messengers of tenderness, the elderly are the messengers of the wisdom of lived experience. Let us move forward and watch the elderly,” he said.",,[],[]
Beauty Products Giant Revlon In Talks To File For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy: Report,"New York-based cosmetics and personal care company Revlon, Inc. REV is reportedly close to filing for bankruptcy.

Revlon is preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as early as next week, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter. The predicament was precipitated by the enormous debt burden the company is left to contend with, the report said.

The company has reportedly started negotiations with its major lenders ahead of the maturing of several of its debts in the coming years. Its long-term debt stood at $3.31 billion at the end of March.

Related Link: Analysis: The Beauty Industry Post-COVID-19

Revlon is owned by MacAndrews & Forbes, the portfolio company of billionaire Ron Perelman. The private-equity firm bought Revlon in 1985.

The talks are ongoing and a Chapter 11 filing isn't a given, the report said.

Consumer discretionary spending took a hit during the pandemic years, and the current fluid macroeconomic condition has only exacerbated the situation. That said, the reopening has recently given a small lift to the demand for the cosmetic products marketed by the company.

Reacting to the report of bankruptcy filing, Revlon stock slipped 7.32% to $1.90 in after-hours trading on Friday, according to Benzinga Pro.

Fiils refillable hair and body care review: Did the eco brand’s formulas deliver?,"In the world of cosmetics, plastic packaging is hard to escape. Factor in that out of all plastic ever to exist, less than 10 per cent of it has been recycled, and you’d be forgiven for needing a lie down.

There is a greener way however, and it comes in the form of refillable beauty products – which is where Fiils comes in.

Was it the metallic aesthetic that first drew us in? Probably. But compared to a typical shampoo bottle, the refills produce 70 per cent less plastic waste and take half the energy to make – and they’re far lighter which makes them less energy intensive to ship.

While recycling is nearly always left up to the consumer, Fiils takes responsibility for its refills, which need to be recycled in a certain way. All we need to do is wash, dry and return them (pre-paid postage of course) and recycling company Terracycle takes care of the rest. The bottle pumps are plastic, but the bottles themselves are aluminium which, unlike glass or plastic, can be recycled pretty much indefinitely.

Formula wise, they’re 99 per cent natural and entirely vegan and cruelty-free, with zilch sulphates and parabens for a gentler cleanse. Silicone is also a no-no, often blamed for dull hair that’s prone to breakage. Scented with pure essential oils, all products are also free from palm oil, one of the major drivers of deforestation.

With all these eco-credentials we couldn’t help but wonder – can this brand still nail both skin and hair care? We put its refills to the test to find out.

How we tested

Adjusting to more natural products can take time, so we tested the hair and body care formulas for just over three weeks. We looked for cost effectiveness, practicality and those all-important formulas, assessing their smell, application and how they made our skin and hair look (and feel), picking a range of scents according to our own skin and hair type.

As one of life’s simple pleasures it was crucial our routine felt just as cleansing, moisturising and pampering as ever. Read on to find out if the brand delivered.

Luxe and minimalist, we love the Fiils aesthetic. With a choice of copper, rose gold and silver, the metallic bottles (£6, Fiils.co) brought sophistication and uniformity to the mishmash of products in our bathroom, and felt robust enough to last.

You might want a different colour for each product though, as dinky labelling makes them hard to tell apart mid-shower. To use as little plastic as possible, you can forgo the plastic pump for screw caps too, but we found these made it harder to control the amount of product we used.

If you prefer unscented products then this is not the brand for you sadly. There are three lush scents to choose from depending on your hair and skin type; lemongrass for oily, coconut for dry and pomelo, which smells similar to grapefruit, for normal – we just picked those that most suited our needs. Feel free to peruse the ingredients list with mini descriptions, which is a nice little guide to exactly what’s inside.

Our locks tend to be oily at the roots and dry toward the end, so we tried the zingy lemongrass shampoo first (£12, Fiils.co). Touted as a go-to for irritated scalps and dandruff, seaweed extract is on hand for damaged strands while green tea extract boasts anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antibacterial properties to boost growth. While we got less of the foamy lather that we’re used to, this seemed to improve with every wash – as a quick tip, you probably need more water rather than more product, and going in for a second wash helps things along.

We also gave the pomelo shampoo a try – it’s a slightly sweeter smelling formula for all hair types and is enriched with vitamin C and moisturising jojoba oil – perfect for shinier tresses.

We tended to our dry ends with the coconut conditioner (£12, Fiils.co), formulated with moisturising shea butter for rescuing brittle strands and sunflower seed oil which tends to itchy scalps, breakage and split ends. If you love the smell of coconut then this dreamily creamy formula will rock your world.

Something to note; sulphate free hair care sapps less of hair’s natural moisture, but in doing so delivers a gentler cleanse which can take time for your scalp to adjust to. As such, we felt our locks were definitely more oily than usual after the first few washes, but we’re so glad we stuck with it.

Our tresses felt nourished, healthy and smooth after a few weeks and, while usually quite flat, felt lighter. That slighty frazzled look towards the ends (after a few rounds of at-home bleaching) was also lessened and, after using the pomelo shampoo especially, we enjoyed a few compliments on how sleek our barnet was looking.

Our favourite of the bodycare bunch is undoubtedly the coconut hand wash (£10, Fiils.co) for normal to dry hands. While many soaps leave our hands feeling dry and tight, this buttery formula left them baby soft – almost like a moisturiser in itself. Hydration aside, coconut essentials oil is famed for its myriad benefits, including being an antibacterial.

Enriched with skin hero vitamin C, the pomelo body wash (£10, Fiils.co) was also a real treat for our skin. Lathering up just enough it had a sweet citrusy scent for an AM shower pick-me-up. Just a few pumps left our skin feeling squeaky clean, healthy and not at all dry post shower. Fiils also touts the formula for addressing uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation and lost elasticity, but as these aren’t concerns we’ve noticed we couldn’t really comment on this.

We also plumped for the coconut hand and body lotion (£12, Fiils.co) for thirsty skin and found it sunk in fast, avoiding any excessive lingering greasiness. Plus, with skin and nail hero olive oil included among it’s ingredients, it is also on hand for a rejuvenating injection of vitamin E. We would say that, while the sweet coconut scent is delicious, it’s quite strong and lingers on the skin which might not be for everyone.

We’ll be honest this isn’t a budget affair, but going for the subscription (which is the plan anyway, given the brands refills) means you get more for less. A £12 shampoo becomes £9.60 for the shampoo, for instance, and you can subscribe for as little as once every three months.

Customisation is part of the brand’s allure, as you can build your own stash whether that’s bodycare, haircare or a mix of everything. Dip your toe in with one bottle and refill, or go all in with the hair duo (£26, Fiils.co) or the body duo (£26, Fiils.co). It does work out cheaper to buy a set, and there’s plenty of combinations depending on your needs, but ultimately the choice is yours.

The verdict: Fiils

Whether you’re after a full blown bathroom overhaul or a small switch, Fiils formulas are worth their salt. All the scents are delicious and for us, the hair care really shone. As our first natural shampoo, patience was a virtue but we were so glad we stuck with it – our locks felt healthier and smoother, and looked glossier than they have in a long time. The body care was also a real treat that felt cleansing yet gentle, a more natural recipe for healthy, hydrated and smooth skin.

There’s no denying Fiils is slightly more spenny than your average body and hair care brand, but really you’re not only paying for a largely natural and organic ingredients list, but a more sustainable supply chain that you can feel good being a part of.

Canadian students saved customers $450k in grocery bills with their ‘peculiar’ delivery service,"A “peculiar” produce delivery service launched by two university students in 2021 is tackling food waste in Vancouver.

Food waste is a complex problem. It significantly accelerates the climate crisis, contributing to approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions every year.

To address this issue, Sang Le and Arielle Lok decided to help reduce food waste on a larger scale. Le, a University of British Columbia Class of 2022 student who studies marketing and business analytics, first became aware of the quantity of household food waste produced from cooking as a college student. She began working on a passion project to reduce food waste, and in December 2020, she met Lok, a McGill University Class of 2023 student who studies finance and shares a common interest in social entrepreneurship.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2021, with Le’s background as an operator in food tech and Lok’s background in venture capital for the consumer goods industry, the two students launched Peko Produce, a “peculiar” produce delivery service in Vancouver that reduces food waste and promotes the accessibility of affordable, healthy food. Their vision is “to build the future of sustainable and socially conscious grocery.”

“Growing up in an Asian household means that our families have always been very frugal with food because they grew up in poverty and understand the labor behind a simple meal,” Le tells NextShark. “During wartime, most Vietnamese – including my grandparents – waited for hours just to get a very little amount of basic commodities using government coupons. Food was scarce, and our families learned to appreciate it early on.”

Le attributes their strong passions for agriculture and entrepreneurship to two influences: their family working in agriculture and the maternal figures in their lives who raised them with street stall food. “As a result,” Le says, “our identities as Asian women definitely translate to our work – we have a close relationship with food, believe that we should do everything with care and definitely bring a ‘mama bear’ approach to our leadership at Peko.”

Story continues

More from NextShark: Ma, Ba, may we talk?: The East Asian dinner table conversation, and what it says about mental health

Despite their own experiences with food insecurity, Le and Lok’s family members could not understand Peko’s mission fully. Le mentions that in the beginning, they “were very confused about why their daughters went to university to sell ‘ugly’ fruits and vegetables.”

To start Peko, Le and Lok went around the Greater Vancouver Area, pitching their produce delivery service to every farm and distributor. Despite the support and positive reception they received, there were still several ups and downs. “Supply was very unpredictable, especially as a small business,” Le shares. “So we were 70% short on our first-ever launch where we received 100 orders over 2 days, did not do quality control well, and received horrible customer feedback (rightfully so). It’s gotten A LOT better since though!”

While working office jobs, Le and Lok searched for a cold produce warehouse or commissary kitchen so they could make a space where they could pack their mystery produce boxes. Some of these locations placed them on multiple year-long waitlists or turned them down due to a lack of space. Operations eventually began thanks to weekend rentals at a coworking space, and since Le and Lok could not drive at the time, their friends delivered everything.

In mid-November 2021, flooding due to the historic atmospheric river event in British Columbia significantly disrupted the area’s supply chain, emptying out grocery stores. During the same week, Le went to the ER for a landslide accident. Because of this, Peko diverted over 12,000 pounds of produce, filled up community fridges and donated to aid communities.

Food waste contributes significantly to pollution – 40% of food produced globally is lost or wasted. In Canada specifically, 58% of all food produced is wasted or lost every year, and $31 billion worth of produce is rejected every year because it does not meet Canada’s cosmetic standards. To address these issues, Peko saves produce from stops along the supply chain, such as farms, distribution centers and retail outlets, to prevent it from being thrown out for looking “peculiar,” for approaching the end of its shelf life or for becoming part of surpluses. Unlike other market solutions that tackle certain parts of the supply chain, Peko sources from domestic and international imports as well as organic and conventional produce to reduce as much food waste as possible.

Peko offers a mystery box for 25 Canadian dollars that contain around 10 to 12 pounds of “peculiar” and surplus produce, both conventional and organic, as well as around nine to 10 varieties of “imperfect” local and exotic fruits and vegetables for up to 40% off grocery prices.

After a few months of watching Peko grow, Le and Lok’s families became more supportive of its cause. In its first year of operation, Peko generated over six figures in sales, divested over 150,000 pounds of produce and saved customers approximately $450,000 in grocery bills.



Since not everyone has access to Peko and similar food delivery services, Le suggests starting where you are: “Put in a little more work – whether that be meal planning, freezing/pickling things, regrowing your food, or chopping off damaged parts of the produce and support[ing] your local food system – this is one of the best ways to support the growers of your food and reduce your environmental impact.”

Reducing individuals’ food waste matters, but it is more impactful to challenge large-scale food systems to reduce their food waste. Lee suggests that we “hold governments and businesses (especially big corporations) accountable to build sustainable practices and reduce wastage – vote with your dollars, we don't have much time left!”

Tackling Action Sports’ Problem with ‘Forever Chemicals’,"There’s a juxtaposition between the outdoor sports we love and the footprint they create. The natural landscapes are what lure us in — the perfect reef that creates a perfect wave or a mountain peak that creates the optimal conditions for skiing or snowboarding. Though we love traveling to The North Shore, The Alps, and other paradises of the world, the increased traffic it all creates through tourism also creates a greater footprint. Ironically, many materials we use for our outdoor clothing, boards, and gear can have harmful effects on the environment and even our own human health and ecosystem. We as consumers can be more aware of how we use these products and have a better understanding of how to conserve in the future. Sustainability has become a buzzword in action sports, but some of these companies known to be the most sustainable are still using toxic chemicals in their manufacturing processes.

Forever Chemicals in Action Sports

PFAS, or per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are “forever chemicals” that persist in the environment and do not decompose in nature. Because these chemicals are weatherproof and stain-resistant, they’re a useful material in outdoor gear. The most common uses of PFAS in these materials include ski and snowboard jackets, bags, some surf waxes, ski waxes, sandals, sunscreen, and even boardshorts and bikinis. The American Chemical Society analyzed wax and repair professionals in the ski and snowboard industry and found them to contain 25 times the amount of PFAS compared to that of the average adult.",,[],"['Mark Stansbury', 'Clean Water Advocate For']"
Sustainability and Environmental Impact of Cosmetics,"The $400 billion-and-growing global cosmetics and beauty industry's environmental impact stretches from the sourcing of raw materials to production, distribution, and waste generated by end consumers.

Cosmetics affect more than the local landfills left with mountains of single-use plastics—they also affect our oceans, our air quality, and the ecosystems that have provided for flora and fauna for thousands of years.

Indeed, species are going extinct for the sake of making skin care and eyeshadow palettes. And in addition to the ways in which wildlife is impacted by the manufacturing and disposal of the products, they are also directly harmed by the still-prevalent practice of animal testing, which occurs throughout 80% of the world.

Here's a rundown of the environmental and sustainability issues surrounding conventional cosmetics.

What Exactly Are Cosmetics? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines cosmetics as ""articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body ... for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance."" Legally, cosmetics include makeup, skin care, hair products, deodorant, and toothpaste.

Chemical Ingredients

One of the most publicized problems with the beauty industry is its use of toxic chemicals. Parabens, plasticizers, formaldehyde, BHA, pesticides, and coal tar are all rife in cosmetics manufacturing, and sunscreens are a great example of the harm these synthetic ingredients can cause when they reach waterways.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calls the world's coral reefs ""one of the most valuable ecosystems on Earth,"" yet they are subjected to an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 tons of sunscreen every year. Chemicals in sunscreen contain nanoparticles that can disrupt coral reproduction and growth, ultimately resulting in bleaching. The Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep Cosmetics Database identifies 1,562 cosmetics and personal care products that contain octinoxate and 615 that contain oxybenzone—these are some of the most environmentally destructive UV filters on the market.

Some 3,600 of the products on EWG's database contain parabens, which can also bleach coral as well as disrupt reproduction in animals, and well over 3,500 contain polyethylene, a type of plastic. Polyethylene is used in cosmetics as an abrasive, emulsion stabilizer, binder, bulker, and film former. It is also the most common material used for microbeads in exfoliating products. Microbeads and other microplastics like glitter wind up in oceans and disrupt the digestive tracts of marine life.

Global analyses of aquatic plastic pollution have found that plastics have been ingested by two-thirds of fish and 90% of seabirds. Those same studies estimate that the rate of ingestion is increasing by roughly 2% per year.

Animal Testing

A reported 80% of countries still allow cosmetics to be tested on animals. Even though the FDA doesn't require any type of testing before a cosmetic hits the U.S. market, countless products that reach American shelves still undergo animal testing because they're produced or sold in countries that allow or require it. Besides the ethical concerns around subjecting more than 100 million animals per year to possible allergens that often kill them, the outdated practice has an apparent bounty of environmental consequences.

Firstly, the animals recruited for laboratory testing are plucked straight from the wild. As a result, the IUCN Red List says the continued existence of species like long-tailed and rhesus macaques—some of the most used—is threatened. The status of the long-tailed macaque, specifically, has jumped two Red List categories, going from a species of least concern to vulnerable to extinction, just since 2008.

Another concern: Animal testing is a highly resource-intensive and wasteful practice. Research animal facilities use 10 times more energy than a standard office because they require so much space, ventilation, temperature stabilization, and constant lighting. A multitude of chemicals are used both for testing and cleaning—these and the bodies of animals contaminated with them create chemical, radioactive, and biological hazards when they're discarded, either by rendering, landfill disposal, or incineration.

Irresponsible Sourcing

The cosmetics industry is a serious natural resource drainer. Take palm oil for example, a vegetal substance that appears (under 20 different names) in more than 2,300 cosmetics on EWG's database. Palm oil grows only in tropical environments within 10 degrees of the equator. A growing demand for the commodity drove suppliers to clear 500 square miles of rainforest in Southeast Asia alone between 2015 and 2018.

Deforestation is already severely polluting because it's often conducted through fire methods, which release tons of carbon—more, even, than the trees themselves sequester—into the environment. But the direct victims of palm oil's widespread rainforest destruction are, of course, primates.

Orangutan Foundation International estimates that 1,000 to 5,000 orangutans are killed in palm oil concessions each year.

Deforestation is also rampant in the mica mining industry. The mineral is often used to add shimmer to cosmetics. It was discovered in more than 13,500 products assessed by EWG, and 4,249 of them were lipsticks and eye shadows.

What's more, both these industries—palm oil and mica—are extracted from the earth by some of the most vulnerable and lowest-paid people in the world. Mining, harvesting, and manufacturing methods are extremely labor-intensive and often carried out in unsafe, unhealthy conditions.

Water Consumption

Iana Kunitsa / Getty Images

Water is in almost every beauty product on the market. The ingredient was listed simply as ""water"" in more than 33,000 products assessed by EWG, and that's not including the thousands more that list it as ""aqua"" or ""eau."" From a waste standpoint, water is entirely safe for the environment (because, well, it makes up 71% percent of the planet already). But from a sustainability standpoint, the resource is noticeably dwindling. The United Nations has predicted that 52% of the world's population will live in water-stressed regions by 2050.

Another problem with using water as a filler to bulk out a product is its weight. Water is heavier than most oils, even, and the heavier the load, the higher the transportation emissions.

Transportation

A beauty product's (or brand's) environmental footprint can be measured using a science-based tool called life cycle assessment. LCAs, as they're often called, look at each stage of the product, from the extraction of ingredients to manufacturing to use to, finally, post-consumer disposal. In the traditional life cycle, transportation occurs between each of these stages—and oftentimes distribution is international.

The U.S. is one of the largest importers and exporters of cosmetics and beauty products. Trade maps show that imports into the states travel, on average, 4,711 miles (about the distance between New York City and Bulgaria), and exports travel even farther.

According to a 2018 Cosmetics Europe report, companies are reducing their carbon footprints by ""shifting their transportation from road to rail and from air to sea"" or by using hybrid and electric vehicles. Other efforts include consolidating distribution networks and growing distribution centers to store products until they're ready to ship, ultimately cutting unnecessary trips.

Air Pollution

In addition to the air pollution caused by carbon emissions from transportation, beauty products with strong scents also clog up the atmosphere with volatile organic compounds. In fact, one study found the VOCs from fragrances, hairsprays, and deodorants to emit the same level of chemical vapors as cars in some cases. (It did note, however, that the balanced ratio was more a result of car pollution going down than pollution from cosmetics going up.)

When the VOCs combine with other air particles, they develop into a nasty kind of particulate matter, PM2.5.

Plastic Pollution

Some products' entire footprint (almost) is in post-consumer recycling and disposal. For instance, as little as 5% of shampoo's total impact is attributable to raw materials, manufacturing, distribution, and packaging. The plastic that's either downcycled, incinerated, or sent to landfills to break down slowly over 450 years accounts for the remaining 95%.

According to Zero Waste Week data, the global cosmetics industry produces 120 billion units of packaging per year. Much of it is plastic—and worse, a variety of plastics that make recycling the packages next to impossible. Therefore, the disposal of these containers accounts for up to 70% of the whole industry's carbon emissions.

The specialized recycling company TerraCycle has been seminal in making sure mixed-material containers (i.e., pump bottles, mascara tubes, compacts, cream jars, etc.) at least get turned into insulation, carpeting, and car parts, but the program has been criticized for giving big corporations an out in the sustainable packaging department.

Sustainable beauty packaging: Five trends to watch in 2022!,"To help brands in their way to sustainability and clarify what is achievable in 2022, Eva Lagarde, founder of the consulting and training company re/sources, has identified five key trends, in terms of sustainable packaging in 2022.

New sustainable materials

Whether they are co-products from the agricultural or food industries (seafood, mushrooms, coconuts, bamboo, sugar cane…), forestry (wood, bark, etc.) or ceramic waste, a lot of new materials are invading our packaging realm.

These materials are attractive for the innovative notion they confer and the story worthiness they offer. There is a lot to say to the consumers about new packaging compounds. Firstly, you are moving away from petroleum, microplastics, ocean waste and all the rest of it, and secondly, the technological, as well as natural aspect, is a captivating storyline.

As an example, TheShellworks is currently developing new packaging from a bacteria digested polymer that is certified fully biodegradable. It will degrade in an industrial composter in about 5 weeks. The company currently offers a palette of 10 colours from off-white to dark mandarin orange or navy blue or black.

Another good example is with Chanel using the moulded pulp made from bamboo and bagasse (sugarcane waste) fibres by Knoll Packaging, and now the caps made with the bio-compound from Sulapac (90% bio-based materials, 10% of which are products derived from camellias), for the new Chanel n°1 range. An interesting move, indeed, from a major luxury player that would probably encourage more brands to embrace these new materials.

It’s worth noting that these new materials could be limited in shapes, colour finishes or decoration capabilities. These materials are also under a new stream of recycling, often through industrial composting (although they will eventually fully degrade in nature), they can damage the current plastic recycling stream if they end up in there. So a clear communication and educational message to consumers are really important to ensure an optimum end of life.

The refill revolution

There are three ways to implement a refill model.

Either through dual inventory in-store, with a host packaging and a refill cartridge or else. Many brands have developed this idea including Tata Harper, Fenty Beauty, Charlotte Tilbury, L’Occitane, to name a few.

The second model is based on an in-store refill device and a host of empty packaging to be filled. The model works well for rinse-off products since there is less risk of formula contamination. Some brands have already entered the game like The Body Shop (at a worldwide sale), Re (UK), Algramo (Chile), The Refillery (Philippines), Mustela (France). For leave on skincare products, French brand Cozie has developed a device that keeps the formula under airtight condition during filling and prints batch numbers for regulatory compliance. The brand has also developed the system for other brands and is working on an overall logistic chain for the collection, cleaning and return of packaging in the loop system.

The third way is to offer a subscription opportunity to consumers, where they receive a refill regularly. Brands with this model include 900.care, What Matters, Izzy, Wild. Within this trend, a lot of brands are now offering extemporaneous formulas, where the consumer would only buy a lot of tablets and re-hydrate the formulas at home with water.

The refill revolution is underway, and with the introduction of new regulations banning single-use plastics, chances are that we’ll see a lot of new initiatives in the near future. Consumers might take time to pick up this new habit and retailers need to adapt as well considering the space, cost and logistical challenges. The supply chain will also need to reorganise its processes to provide stores with “bulk” formulas in a seamless fashion. Until standard systems are set, it might remain a complex alternative.

End of life management

Today, only a very small percentage of beauty items get recycled. You know the drill. They are either “too small” or “too complex” (multiple layers of different materials, material mix, etc.) to get recycled. But now, with regulations banning some packaging items, pushing some material streams, or pushing the percentage of PCR content, a new balance needs to be found for a better recyclability of beauty products packaging.

To capture and manage the beauty empties, beauty brands work together with specialized organisations. In the U.S., for instance, Credo Beauty cooperates with Pact Collective, and L’Occitane and Garnier with TerraCycle. Also in the U.S., a coalition of brands is now working on small format analysis to optimise recycling.

However, it won’t be enough. To ensure a smooth end of life, smart solutions can be applied to packaging for usage and recycling instructions. With the new regulations coming into force, it will be hard to print everything on the pack, so packaging will need to become smarter with QR codes or NFC chips.

Another avenue to manage waste is to design it out, by removing all non-essential packaging, moving to mono-material items matching with currently available recycling streams, and avoiding all materials where the end of life is not widely controlled on the market. A lot of packaging manufacturers are offering these innovative solutions. But what do you do when an organised recycling scheme is not available in the region in which you want to sell. Brands will keep evolving on that front and even work with suppliers to implement safe solutions.

Paperization and woodification

Paper (or cardboard) - made from wood - is a really attractive solution from a sustainability standpoint since it is easily identifiable as a green option. There is direct understanding from consumers and recycling or compostability is available worldwide.

Pulpex, Paboco, Ecologic solutions which dramatically reduce the use of plastic are interesting solutions for bottled products. As far as skincare jars are concerned, there are many technical questions. We can make a jar from a wood resin as shown by Sulapac, or the latest innovation - dubbed “conic” - from Holmen Iggesund. However, paper is not waterproof, yet, and promoting it as such could be misleading.

Also, virgin paper is not necessarily less carbon-intensive than recycled paper when you take the entire lifecycle into account. Like any material, all impacts must be measured for proof. A paper that would be covered by more than 70% of metalised decoration might not be recycled. And when plastic is layered inside paper to waterproof it, plastic then gets discarded at the end of life and not recycled.

Paper boxes are also now coming without vacform in plastic, another new “moulded” pulp technology is offering more options from bamboo, wood or other plant waste, but we don’t know the CO2 footprint of these solutions compared to existing cardboard whether virgin or recycled.

Wood caps are also invading the market, with no or removable insert, which allows for a better end of life. They offer the sensorial feel that consumers are tending to right now. It’s worth noting that there is no recycling “stream” for wood caps, and they might be burnt or integrated into an industrial composting system. They do not represent a high volume in the market, and ultimately will fully degrade, so they remain a good option.

Indeed, wood and paper solutions are biodegradable in the end - if not decorated heavily - so they are a great avenue to explore for an eco-friendly approach but remember that obvious solutions are not necessarily greener or less CO2 intensive. There are many parameters to take into consideration when claiming environmentally.

In line with the “diversity” and “inclusivity” trends that have been growing in recent years, and are still a work in progress, we are now moving into the “accessible beauty” concept, making beauty items easier to manipulate.

From less tight opening caps, easier to handle brushes, simpler closers or holders, more readable instructions, there are many roads to explore for a more diverse more accessible beauty.

It will be a technical challenge to manufacture these solutions at scale and additive printing could be a way to explore exclusive ranges in smaller quantities. Olay is currently trailing its new accessible cap, and the future will tell us if the adoption is successful. Another brand to explore is Victorialand in the US which has launched a beauty routine with easily identifiable reading symbols, for people with visual impairments without the knowledge of Braille.

Like all the trends mentioned above, Accessible Beauty will require tests and trials before we identify the right model. This will also impact the beauty standards overall and we are coming to an era of the beauty of imperfections. Beauty is no longer a judgement tool but is entering a more holistic and well-being approach.

What if beauty was here to empower consumers instead of slaving them to impossible standards. Being green is also being inclusive.

In conclusion: keep realistic and transparent

Something we haven’t mentioned in the trends, as we think it’s an underlying trend to all of the above. TRANSPARENCY. It won’t suffice to say that you are doing good. Brands will need to show proof of their green efforts. Blockchain will be a great contributor in offering a verification tool for the entire supply and retail chain.

In general, using claims that are too simple won’t help us. “zero plastic” or “zero waste” can be detrimental to the entire beauty industry. We can’t build a pump without plastic, so zero plastic is not realistic but the reduction of plastic or waste, in general, is a more accurate way to promote your efforts.

In essence, we need to implement a more “nuanced” position on the market, explaining where we are at right now and what we are trying to achieve in the future. No solution is perfect today. Edutainment and using the metaverse will be a great way to interact with consumers, educate consumers, and co-develop products with them.

Maybe you need to educate yourself first for clearer messaging?",,[],"['Meiyume Develops Exclusive Halal Sun Care Formulation For Carasun', 'Makeup Brushes', 'How To Go Even Further In Designing Eco Products Of Tomorrow']"
