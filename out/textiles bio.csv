"Textile Exchange Pushes Biosynthetics, ‘Phase Out’ of Fossil-based Synthetics","Synthetics need a makeover, according to Textile Exchange.

Since the ’90s, synthetic fiber produced from non-renewable, fossil-fuel origins have dominated the market, with share only expected to grow with global fashion production. But in Textile Exchange’s latest report, fiber’s potential lies not in virgin synthetics but increasingly in biosynthetics. And fossil-fueled fabrics need a “phase out,” according to the report.

Biosynthetics are synthetic fibers that are wholly or partially derived from bio-based resources, like corn, sugar beet, sugarcane, wheat and castor, which have already populated sustainable lines from H&M to Allbirds in recent years.

According to Textile Exchange, polyester had a market share of around 52 percent of total global fiber production in 2020, or approximately 57 million tonnes of polyester. In comparison, the market share of biosynthetics — which often aren’t totally clean of fossil fuels — is nominal. Bio-based polyester had a market share of 0.03 percent of all polyester fiber produced globally in 2020.

The reason for this dominance is the lost cost of fossil-based synthetics, relatively limitless properties and limited expansion capabilities in natural fiber production. Biosynthetics also vary widely in scale and access.

While multiple contributors were behind Textile Exchange’s latest report, the organization affirmed its belief in a “global 100 percent fossil-free synthetic textile industry that protects and restores the environment, while enhancing lives.” All recommendations in the report align with Textile Exchange’s Climate+ strategy, building upon recommendations on regenerative practices, carbon sequestration and circular solutions.

To get to this vision, Textile Exchange outlined the nuance (be it around concerns of productivity, food security, GMOs or biodegradability), best sourcing practices and strategies for getting fashion within the 1.5-degrees Celsius pathway in reducing global temperature rise, with biosynthetics as a lever for change.

But it isn’t the only one, of course — hence the organization’s safeguarding of a “portfolio approach” to a bio-based circular economy.

When it comes to misnomers on biosynthetics, the report affirmed the focus should not be on finding the “perfect feedstock,” rather on continuously improving the best available option for a specific application in a local context. It also accentuated the importance of ensuring waste residues are truly waste and not displaced from other sources.

As for responsible sourcing practices, the report pointed to working definitions from The Bioplastic Feedstock Alliance/World Wildlife Fund, which referred to “responsibly sourced bio-content” as content that “at a minimum must be legally sourced; derived from renewable biomass; pose no adverse impacts on food security; have no negative impact on land conversion, deforestation, or critical ecosystems, and provide environmental benefits — including near-term climate benefits compared with fossil-based plastic.”

The report also touches on terminology relevant to the increasing interest in biosynthetics, including potentially unfamiliar measurement terms like land-use change, or LUC, how a conversion of land area affects impact, and references thought leaders like the Nova-Institute and standards like that of The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials, or RSB.

Somewhat contentious topics, like fiber scoring in the Higg MSI (which has been heavily criticized in the past by natural fiber advocates) and microplastics were also mentioned.

Recommending that one biosynthetic material’s scores not be generalized for all biosynthetics, the report noted, “A commonly asked question is why biosynthetics score worse than fossil-based synthetics in the Higg MSI. The Higg MSI Raw Material Source score is often referenced in a way implicating that biosynthetics score worse than fossil-based synthetics.…In the first phase of this tool, biosynthetics will not be included. This decision was made due to prioritization needs (focusing on large volume materials) and challenges regarding impact assessment for biosynthetics compared to fossil-based and recycled synthetics.”

Textile Exchange concluded that the biosynthetics transition needs to happen faster with all players at the table, requiring “significant efforts” and investments by industry, policymakers and society as a whole.",,[],['Kaley Roshitsh']
PATAGONIA & HEIQ LAUNCH JOINTLY DEVELOPED NEXT GENERATION MINT-BASED TEXTILE ODOR CONTROL TECHNOLOGY,"The long-standing research partnership between Patagonia and HeiQ resulted in yet another innovative solution for a problem on many textiles – malodor. Inspired by Patagonia's determination to continuously improve the chemistry used on all their products, the two pioneers announce the launch of HeiQ Fresh MNT, next generation sustainable odor control based on essential mint oil derived from a renewable and sustainable source.

Modern Synthesis raises $4.1m to grow fashion textiles from microbes,"Disclosure: AFN’s parent company, AgFunder, is an investor in Modern Synthesis.

UK-based biomaterials startup Modern Synthesis has raised $4.1 million in seed funding to support its microbial textile platform that aims to make the fashion industry more sustainable.

Investors in the round include AgFunder, Collaborative Fund, Acequia Capital, Petri Bio, Ponderosa Ventures, Possible Ventures, IMO Ventures, Taihill Venture, Parley for the Oceans, Climate Capital Collective, and former Jimmy Choo CEO Pierre Denis.

How it works:

Modern Synthesis’ microbial textile tech leverages bacteria to transform sugar from agricultural waste into nanocellulose, a biodegradable material valued for its abundance and its strength. The goal is to replace animal- and petrochemical-derived materials, helping the fashion industry lower its carbon footprint.

The startup’s “ microbial weaving ” process mimics the warp-and-weft technique of traditional weaving to create a customizable biomaterial in roughly 10 to 14 days.

Staff at Modern Synthesis create a scaffold, using robotics to place fibers in the desired shape or structure. Genetically modified bacteria grow around those structures to create the final material.

Similar to 3D printing — and unlike traditional weaving — pieces can be designed to shape, which means no scraps of leftover material and therefore no waste.

So far, Modern Synthesis has been able to build the upper part of a shoe using this process. The company says it has delivered its materials to a “key sportswear customer” for prototyping.

It plans to eventually leverage microbes to displace a variety of animal- and petrochemical-derived leathers, textiles, and films.

Why it matters:

Instead of trying to create an exact replica for a material like leather, Modern Synthesis says it is focused on developing an entirely new kind of material – and in the process, build out an entirely separate category for materials.

“What we’re trying to do is build this new class of materials that is more sustainable but also allows us to design and create in new ways, which is really exciting for the fashion industry,” Modern Synthesis co-founder and CEO Jen Keane tells AFN.

The startup is one of a few trying to create this “new class” of materials. New York-based Bucha Bio said much the same thing in 2021 about its leather-like biotextile made by fermentation, and MycoWorks recently bagged $125 million in Series C funding to further develop its fungi-based leather alternative [disclosure: AFN‘s parent company, AgFunder, is an investor in MycoWorks.] Keane previously spent time as a creative resident at another well-known biomaterials startup, Bolt Threads.

That said, a 2021 report from the Material Innovations Initiative (MII) found that even if the biotextile space hits its projected $2.2 billion market by 2026, it will still only represent about 3% of the materials market – with 69% animal-based materials and petroleum-based items making up the rest.

Beyond demand, one of the biggest challenges facing the market is a lack of supply. “There are currently more interested investors than suitable investment opportunities,” said MII’S report.

That presents a fairly wide window of opportunity for companies like Modern Synthesis – and a new way for brands to think about sustainable clothing.

The bigger picture:

Modern Synthesis isn’t just focusing on alt-materials.

“At the end of the day, we’re trying to build a circular manufacturing system with these microbes,” says Keane. “That enables us to leverage agricultural waste and use the microbes as manufacturing units and transfer them into more viable materials. On the flip side, we see the opportunity to have new-class materials that are fully cellulosic, so we can recycle them back into silos and recycling streams.”

More than 70% of the fashion industry’s greenhouse gas emissions come from upstream processes such as raw material production, preparation, and processing.

How it’ll spend the funding:

Most of Modern Synthesis’ seed capital will go towards building its pilot facility, which will allow the company to make more materials.

The planned site in London will house a lab, as well as sampling and pilot production capabilities. It’s on track to being operational by Q3 2022.

The funds will also enable the company to build its team simultaneously to increasing capacity.

“Our goal is to get these materials out in the world as quickly, widely, and responsibly as possible. And to do that, we need to leverage as many R&D resources as we can to speed up that process,” says Keane.",,[],[]

New Zealand’s Humble Bee Bio is using bees to create bioplastics,"Humble Bee Bio is on a mission to create a biodegradable alternative to plastics by synthesizing the biology of bees. While the New Zealand-based company is still at an early stage — it’s about halfway through its proof of concept — if Humble Bee is successful, its bioplastics are likely to make it into the sustainable textiles industry.

Humble Bee, which just raised $3.2 million (NZD $5 million) in convertible notes as part of its Series A, has been studying the Australian masked bee, a type of solitary bee that doesn’t make honey, but does make a nesting material for laying larvae in, which has many plastic-like properties.

“It’s resistant to acids and bases. It’s hydrophobic, it’s waterproof, it’s flame retardant, it’s stable up to 240 degrees Celsius,” Ryan Graves, Humble Bee’s chief technology officer, told TechCrunch. “The idea is, how do we recreate this?”

The team is using a synthetic biology approach that involves going into the bee’s genetic code and identifying the genes and proteins responsible for the nesting material. Humble Bee has extracted the code and is trying to recreate it in the laboratory. Next, the company will attempt to synthesize plastic-like materials, focusing on four different types of biomaterials that can be turned into fibers and finishing for fabrics.

Humble Bee is aiming for anywhere from March to June 2023 to prove out the concept, at which point the team hopes to scale production using industrial-scale fermentation.

“There’s a degree of exploration still to go on,” said Graves, “The processes are time-intensive and they are challenging. Getting going from code to protein is usually a 12-month process, and then we need to scale it up to get hundreds of grams of the stuff out.”

Only then can Humble Bee even think about a commercial strategy, but Graves said the company has already been approached by many textiles companies and other companies that use upholstery. We know the likes of Airbus, Toyota and Ford are trying to implement circular economy practices and need to think about the whole life cycle of their products.

“At the moment, you look inside a car, and it’s largely petrochemical-based, so the degradation properties on that are just pretty horrendous,” said Graves.

The CTO also said fashion brands have been reaching out to Humble Bee Bio. Environmental sustainability has become a priority for apparel companies, particularly when it comes to responsible and sustainable sourcing of materials, according to a 2019 McKinsey study. This is most evident so far with activewear brands, like The North Face, which used Brewed Protein materials for its Moon Parka, or Adidas, which partnered with Bolt Threads to create a shoe using a mushroom-based material.

“There’s a load of different companies in this space and that’s one of the things that has enabled us to move really fast,” said Graves. “We’re standing on the shoulders of giants that have done a lot with spider silks. So you’ve got companies like Bolt Threads and Spiber that have big market capitalizations and are much closer to the commercial end. They’ve made proof of concept garments, which is a whole step above what we’re trying to do here.”

With Humble Bee’s most recent raise, the company is aiming to hire another senior scientist and continue funding its outsourced R&D. Graves said New Zealand isn’t the best place for manufacturing biotech because of some “old school” genetic engineering laws, so it looks to countries like Thailand, the U.S., Mexico and Argentina where there’s existing infrastructure in the space.

“One of the beauties of doing biomanufacturing is once you’ve got the code, the actual engineered cell and basically the recipe for how you do the fermentation, is that it’s possible to do a distributed manufacturing model,” said Graves.

The company has got its eye on its next raise if all goes well with proof of concept, and said it is shopping for VCs that focus on the impact and climate space and are not averse to risk.",,[],[]

"Austin Newton, 'pioneer in molecular biology,' dies at 85","Austin Newton spent his entire academic career at Princeton, first in the biology department and biochemical sciences program, then as a founding member of the Department of Molecular Biology. During this time, he established a new experimental system and mentored many generations of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. He died May 13 in Princeton at age 85.

Austin Newton

""Austin's work on the cell biology of Caulobacter was groundbreaking,"" said Lynn Enquist, Princeton's Henry L. Hillman Professor in Molecular Biology, Emeritus, who chaired the department from 2004 to 2013. ""He was a pioneer in molecular biology.""

Born in Richmond, Texas, Newton graduated from the University of Texas-Austin in 1959 and received a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California-Berkeley in 1964, then joined the group headed by Nobel Laureate Jacques Monod at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Newton pursued his postdoctoral studies during a time that has been called the ""golden age of molecular biology."" He showed how an outstanding puzzle in gene regulation could be solved by the clever utilization of simple genetic tools. In Paris, he also discovered an abiding passion for sub-Saharan and West African sculpture and textiles.

At Princeton, where he was appointed an assistant professor in 1966, he published several classic papers of fundamental importance to understanding coordinated gene translation. He soon realized, however, that molecular biology was moving on, and that the genetic approaches with which he was familiar could be applied to fundamental problems in developmental biology. This became the major focus of his research at Princeton.

Newton was promoted to associate professor in 1973 and to full professor in 1978. He retired in 2009. In addition to his teaching and research at Princeton, supported by competitive awards from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, he served on the editorial board of the Journal of Bacteriology and as associate editor of Developmental Genetics. He was a member of various scientific societies and a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology.

Newton pioneered a new field, using genetic and molecular analyses to study the origins of asymmetric cell division — a characteristic of stem cells and cancer stem cells but also one that distinguishes Caulobacter, a tiny freshwater bacterium. Newton and his group made groundbreaking discoveries on the mechanisms governing asymmetric cell division, cell polarity, cell cycle organization and the conversion of cells from one morphology to another.

""His contributions to our understanding of how cell polarity changes are linked to cell cycle progression were truly pioneering,"" said Myriam Heiman, who completed her undergraduate thesis with Newton in 1998 and is now the Latham Family Career Development Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a core member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. ""I feel honored to have had the opportunity to work in his group, even if for a short period of time.""

Colleagues say Newton’s research was marked by vision and scientific imagination, traits that characterized his interactions with students and colleagues as well as his life in general. Many of his students have gone on to leading scientific roles in graduate and medical school departments or distinguished careers in biomedical industries. Students credit him with teaching them how to identify and tackle scientific problems.

Newton is remembered as a connoisseur who successfully mixed his broad interests in science, music (piano and Bach were favorites), art (especially African art), travel and good wine. Together with his long-time collaborator and wife, Noriko Ohta, one of Princeton's first female Ph.D. graduates, Newton shared a full and exciting life, welcoming a generation of students, postdocs, faculty and friends from around the world.

""When I first joined the department almost 30 years ago, Austin contacted me immediately to offer his help in purchasing a house and showing me around Princeton,"" Enquist recalled. ""Even though I was in another building, he stopped by regularly to help me negotiate the various issues of setting up my lab. He had a wry sense of humor and a passion for music and art.""

His is survived by Ohta and his sister Margueritte Dell Newton of Texas.

Bio-Butanol Market: COVID-19 Impact Analysis

COVID-19 impacted various industries. Lockdowns in multiple countries and logistical issues have hurt the sectors. Supply chain interruptions, human shortages, logistical restrictions, component shortages, demand reduction, inadequate corporate finances, and lockouts in numerous nations have hurt the sector. In this crisis, raw material suppliers and other enterprises must reconsider their strategies to serve this industry. The outbreak has halted residential and commercial construction. During the crisis, this industry's bio-butanol demand will be low to medium.

Delays in order delivery, supply chain constraints, a lack of people and equipment, and a lack of materials are all major concerns. After the crisis, demand for bio-Butanol is expected to surge. Even without shutdowns, restrictions on personnel and materials have slowed operations. Countries relaxed restrictions and opened business in many industries in 2020. Even after the lockout, bio-Butanol facilities will have trouble restarting. This affects bio-Butanol sales.

Bio-Butanol Market: Segmentation Overview

The global Bio-Butanol market is segregated based on Raw Material, Application, and End-Use Industry.

In terms of Application, the acrylates category led the global market in the forecast period. Growing demand for the product from different coatings applications such as paper coatings, leather coatings, and water-based coatings is likely to drive growth throughout the forecast period. Furthermore, increased R&D on bio-butanol as a motor fuel to replace gasoline due to its better physical qualities and cost-effectiveness is projected to generate new market prospects in the near future.

In terms of Raw Materials, Cereals represented a substantial proportion of the bio-butanol market in the forecast period. Butanol may be produced from a range of agricultural and forestry leftovers, as well as some energy crops, such as apple pomace, potato peel, brewer's wasted malt, corn cobs, corn stover, and corn fiber. Whereas the production process includes pre-treatment of wheat straw with dilute sulphuric acid to enhance cellulose accessibility to hydrolytic enzymes. The pretreated wheat straw is then hydrolyzed with hydrolytic enzymes to break down the cellulose into simple 5-carbon or 6-carbon sugars, followed by a combination fed-batch fermentation/gas stripping process to convert the sugars to butanol without product inhibition. As cereals are the primary raw material used in the manufacturing of bio-butanol, an increase in cereal output may aid in the expansion of the bio-butanol industry.

Inside Future Fabrics Expo: Materials innovation in overdrive,"A key theme for this year’s event is the diversification of the fibre basket — a process that prompts brands to question why they want a particular material for a particular use rather than rely on the predictable rotation of organic cotton, recycled synthetics and bovine leather.

Another theme is the reframing of innovative materials through a broader social and political lens. “There will be a real focus on the people and communities protecting biodiversity, how we involve them in an equitable way and avoid a colonial mindset,” says Amanda Johnston, curator and educational consultant for the Expo. “We want to show the interrelationships between climate, biodiversity loss and material choices.”

In an exclusive preview of this year’s event, Marenzi and Johnston highlight some of the most promising material picks.

Alternatives to animal leather

“The most popular area is always the skin rail,” says Johnston. This year, it features more non-animal skins than ever, including options with no or low plastic, and others made from agricultural waste.

Regenerative agriculture is a hot topic this year and features heavily in the education spaces and seminar series running throughout the Expo. Maison/0, a Central Saint Martins-LVMH creative platform exploring regenerative luxury, is presenting Rewilding Textiles, a guide to the topic.

Companies that prefer to avoid animal leather will have plenty of options. Marenzi highlights Hide Biotech, a protein biomaterial leather alternative engineered from collagen, and Natural Fibre Welding’s bio-based, plastic-free offering Mirium, used by Camper and Pangaia. Ecovative, which formed a cooperative with PVH and Bestseller late last year, is also on the roster.

“Before, people who wanted alternatives to leather were forced to work with plastic, without fully understanding how that contributes to plastic pollution,” says Marenzi. “There’s a far more nuanced conversation around leather and its alternatives now, rather than the broad-brush ‘no leather’ approach of previous years.” The 2022 Expo includes an exhibition space dedicated to plastic-free fashion, led by Siân Sutherland, co-founder of lobbying organisation A Plastic Planet.

Emerging innovators

Natural dyes also take prominence this year, offering new options to replace conventional synthetic dyes and introducing alternatives powered by algae or bacteria. Colorifix and Living Ink are two to check out, says Marenzi. Central Saint Martins graduate Scarlett Yang is a name-to-know here, using algae extract and silk cocoon to create a glass-like material that grows over time and can decompose in water within 24 hours. “Algae and microbial dyes are booming,” she adds.",,[],"['Condé Nast', 'Bella Webb']"
Connecting materials science with fungal biology: A personal insight,"Images from: https://fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-022-00133-y/figures/3, https://fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-021-00125-4/figures/6, https://fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-020-00095-z/figures/1

Today, I’d like to discuss the Article Collection “Connecting materials science with fungal biology“ which comprised twelve papers published in Fungal Biology and Biotechnology between Spring 2021 and Spring 2022 (http://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/CMSFB). These papers describe different use cases for fungal mycelium in material science. The applications vary from composite material in construction or for indoor insulation purposes to new materials in the textile and health care industries, as well as others.

I would like to chat with you about some of the contributions described, focusing particularly on practical implications, relevance to current and long-term solutions, and a personal perspective.

1.1 Fungal biocomposites: How to

It has been shown very often that fungal mycelium could be used for the fabrication of bio-composites. These materials consist mainly of lignocellulosic feedstocks that are “glued” together with mycelium. The fungus not only connects the particles but also degrades them, since fungi are the only known living organism that are able to degrade ligno-cellulose. The production process is quite straight forward, starting with pure cultures from petri dishes, followed by pre-culturing in vessels or beakers with a proper substrate, such as grain. The preculture is then used to inoculate larger bags and after that filled in molds to get structured bio-composites. It is well illustrated in the study by Pohl et al. (https://fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-022-00133-y) for the fungus Fomes fomentarius and it can be also seen in the following workflow:

1.2 Fungal biocomposites: Practical implications

Conventional composites can be found in many areas of our life. They are generally defined as combinations of different materials, together having specific physical and chemical properties. We are surrounded by composite materials, such as in construction sides, by wood composites or polymers. Some are hidden and used for insulation, or for other purposes. All these materials could be potentially substituted by mycelium based composites. Especially in packaging and insulation production they seem to be promising, and cleaner candidates compared to oil based products.

1.3 Fungal biocomposites: Personal thoughts

I really love the idea of living in a house which consists completely of fungi. The building industry could become more sustainable by using basic principles of circular economy, with fungal mycelium as the stabilizing compound. This fact is covered by a review of Almpani-Lekka et al. with various examples (https://fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-021-00124-5). However, personally, I think establishing the new methods will take time and work only to a limited extent. There will be more research needed to also extend the production capacity at larger scales on one hand and to improve the materials properties, for example making them water resistant, on the other hand. A recently published work by Esacker et al. (https://www.mdpi.com/2313-7673/7/2/57) discusses an improvement by adding inorganic clay particles. Nevertheless, the conventional and unsustainable building industry is growing very fast and a rethinking in the sense of using biodegradable material is crucial.

2.1 Intelligent fungal skins: How to

Adamatzky et al. (https://fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-021-00113-8) have introduced a relatively new field into the mycelium materials issue by studying if and how living mycelium skins can be used for different purposes. Basically, the production processes remain the same with the difference, that these materials are used as flexible skin sheets with the possibility to react to mechanical or other stimulations. The authors measured electrical activity of the mycelium of Ganoderma resinaceum after stimulating it with weight and light. The outcome is that it reacts to the stimuli by changing the internal, electric potential that was measured.

2.2 Intelligent fungal skins: Practical implication

Due to relatively low production costs and the biology of fungi potentially degrading waste materials, the stimulation response of intelligent living skins could be used in many fields. Flexible and living electronics are also a growing market, since they potentially could substitute rare earths and metals for some applications, where devices are needed to be small and handy.

2.3 Intelligent fungal skins: Personal thoughts

Personally, I think that if fungal intelligent skins are manageable in the future, they could be used for body modification and communication along small distances in or at the human body. One question that spontaneously came into my mind was, whether it is possible to use these skins to help paraplegic people by connecting damaged neurons?

3.1 Risk assessment: How to

As described before, it is imaginable to live in fungal houses and be surrounded by fungal mycelium all the time or to wear fungal skins. However, due to close contact to these partially living materials, a proper risk assessment is needed. Van den Brandhof et al. (https://fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-022-00134-x) describes that the selection of the species used should be based on a risk assessment of the mushroom. It must be differentiated between a fungus that is alive and kept alive, for instance for the active production of new material bio-composites and materials that are inactivated or killed as a final step of their production life cycle. Van den Brandhof also classifies the potential risks into different groups, such as the mycotoxin production, their impact on the biotic environment and the pathogenicity of the used fungi.

3.2 Risk assessment: Practical implication

Generally, the materials and the mushrooms are considered to be safe to human beings. This is assumed especially when some of the organisms have been used by humanity for thousands of years or when their usage is described in traditional medicine of human cultures, like in traditional Chinese medicine.

3.3 Risk assessment: Personal thoughts

The recommendations that are given at the end of the described paper are generally a good guide to decide which fungus can be used under which circumstances. However, their approach is, I think, only scratching at the surface and a proper risk assessment should be performed. Killing and inactivating the fungus is useful but only does so much. One should also measure other factors, such as the release of nano-scale particles of the vegetative mycelium that might enters the air and be taken up by breathing. Another factor, which comes from my professional interest and work, are the volatile compounds, that most organisms produce. It is well known that these can be irritating or sometimes toxic. The use of proper in vitro systems for these compounds has been described recently (https://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/8/1/75). It would also be urgently needed to gain data regarding the safety of the new materials within an occupational context.

All in all, the works discussed here, and the Article Collection in general, are meant to stimulate thought, participation, and engagement. There is still a lot to do, as described in the Article Collection, and the involvement of many disciplines is very important in the process.",,[],['Kustrim Cerimi']
Bridging the PET waste gap with C-Zyme,"Technology has the ability to tap into vast new sources for recycling PET and is based on a very selective enzyme that will only depolymerize PET and not other materials.

In February this year, Carbios, based in Clermont-Ferrand, France, succeeded in producing both 100% enzymatically recycled white PET fibre and bottle-grade PET from mixed coloured textile waste, using its C-Zyme process.

The significance of this achievement was underlined by Bruno Langlois, the company’s business development and partnership director, at EDANA’s International Nonwovens Conference held in Lyon, France, on June 8-9.

C-Zyme means that virtually all PET that goes onto the market now has the potential to be recycled

“Fibre to fibre recycling is the only way to achieve true circularity and for the pledges fashion brands have already made to be realised,” he said. “Our technology has the ability to tap into vast new sources for recycling PET and is based on a very selective enzyme that will only depolymerize PET and not other materials in waste clothing, such as adhesives, dyes and other polymers.

“The process is low temperature and operates at atmospheric pressure with no solvents. The PET is extracted and separated and the recovered monomers are virgin quality.”

Prior to the C-Zyme process, the waste textiles are shredded and densified to reduce crystallinity and increase the surface area. C-Zyme can then degrade 98% of such a mass in 16 hours.

Langlois pointed out that around 90 million tons of PET is produced each year, with around 27 millions tons going into packaging and the remainder used to make fibres.

Currently, only 13% of textile waste is recycled, and mainly into lower quality applications such as nonwoven padding, insulation or wipes.

Not surprisingly, things are moving fast for the company, whose demonstration plant has been operational since September 2021. Since validating the C-Zyme process, it has subsequently partnered with Indorama Ventures to build an enzymatic PET bio-recycling production plant in Longlaville, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France, with a processing capacity of around 50,000 tons of post-consumer PET waste per year by 2025 – the equivalent to 2 billion PET bottles.

From January 1st 2025, the separate collection of textile waste, which is already in place in some countries, will be mandatory for all EU Member States and the Carbios process will be one of the solutions that will enable this waste to be sustainably recovered and included in a true circular economy model.

“C-Zyme means that virtually all PET that goes onto the market now has the potential to be recycled,” Langlois said. “We are targeting 90-95% recovery of polymers from the textile waste material.”

E-textile Market Driver:

This growth is likely to be driven by the rising demand for smart apparel and high-performance health monitoring equipment. E-textiles in the fitness and sports segment helps in coaching the players and fitness seekers and helps in the improvement of golf swings, tennis serves, and ski techniques. Apart from sports, defense and healthcare are the major end-user segments for health monitoring wearables. In the military and defense, these wearables are used to monitor and relay the vital health statistics of soldiers on the field. It enables on-field doctors and rescue teams to act immediately in case of emergencies. Moreover, these e-textiles are also used in personal protective equipment and apparel to reduce the extent of risks that users are exposed to and provide them with suitable environment-based external stimuli. Therefore, the introduction of high-functional e-textiles is enabling monitoring and improving the overall health of an individual. This will lead to the high adoption of these wearables during the forecast period.

E-textile Market Challenge:

E-textiles are priced much higher than regular textiles as these products involve the incorporation of electronic components and technologies such as nanotechnology and BLE technology. The high R&D investments required for the development of these products also add to the end cost. Products based on advanced technologies such as nanotechnologies and BLE technology are integrated into woven fabrics or textiles for developing e-textiles. The production cost of these fabrics increased over the years, with the growing demand for woven textiles and fabrics. In addition, the total employment in the textile industry has increased over the years owing to the increased sales volume and costs related to textile and fabric production. Asian apparel producers are facing a 5% increment in employees' minimum wage since January 2016. High production costs of textiles and apparel will increase the cost of e-textiles as well and will serve as a hindrance to the market growth.

cleenTEC seal spells out the benefits,"Dimension-Polyant, the manufacturer of durable X-Pac waterproof laminates based in Kempen, Germany, has created a cleenTEC seal to help identify that X-Pac fabrics have been made with recycled, bio-based, and/or responsibly sourced materials.

In addition, it guarantees the materials are made by responsible manufacturing processes at production facilities that are 100% climate neutral.

Working with ClimatePartner, the company calculates the total environmental impact of each cleenTEC fabric and funds initiatives that invest in sustainable wind power developments or ocean plastic collection to offset the carbon footprint.

“We wanted to create a seal that would help brands better identify and understand our responsibly-sourced, carbon-neutral fabrics and that we go beyond being just a supplier of another recycled fabric,” said Uwe Stein, Dimension-Polyant CEO.

The company’s portfolio of cleenTEC certified fabrics includes its popular VX21, which is now 100% carbon neutral, along with the new RX and X11 fabrics which will be presented at Techtextil in Frankfurt from June 21-24.

X-Pac RX is a collection of mono-polymer fabrics made with a 100% post-consumer recycled polyester face fabric and X-PLY reinforcement. The recycled polyester fibere is made from discarded PET bottles and a lighter-weight polyester film backing provides a sleek, technical appearance.

For a more natural aesthetic, Dimension-Polyant has recently developed X-Pac X11, which is made with a 100% organic cotton duck face fabric, black recycled polyester X-PLY reinforcement and shiny polyester film backing.

Additional updates to the X-Pac collection of fabrics include the company’s strongest, most durable laminate, UVX40, now made with bio-based Dyneema fibres, and all X-PLY fibre reinforcements are now made with post-consumer recycled polyester.

“Many of our brand partners have expressed how much they appreciate all that goes into responsibly sourcing our raw materials to reduce our carbon footprint and take an industry lead in developing climate-neutral fabrics,” said Stein. “We are proud to have attained ClimatePartner’s ‘cradle-to-customer plus end-of-life’ certificate for our cleenTEC seal fabrics, which we believe are the first and only climate-neutral laminates made for packs.”

Dimension-Polyant will exhibit within the Sioen stand, C50 in Hall 11 at Techtextil.

Effect of plasma sericin glutaraldehyde treatments on the low stress mechanical properties of micro denier polyester/cotton blended fabric,"Tensile properties

The linearity of the load extension curve (LT), tensile energy (ET), tensile resilience (RT), and elongation (EMT) is the low-stress tensile parameters that have been assessed, as represented graphically in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4.

Figure 1 Extensibility (EMT%) of samples. Full size image

Figure 2 Linearity (LT) of samples. Full size image

Figure 3 Tensile energy (ET) of sample. Full size image

Figure 4 Tensile resilience (RT) % of samples. (a–d) Possible ways of fixation of glutaraldehyde on the fabric sample. Full size image

Figures 1 and 2 show the extensibility and linearity of the samples. Regarding extensibility (EMT), the statistical analysis shows that there is no significant difference. Because of this, the treatments have practically no effect on extensibility. The same comments hold good linearity of the load extension curve.

Figures 3 and 4 represent the tensile energy (ET) and tensile resilience (RT) values. In the case of tensile energy values, again, there is no significant difference. However, there is a significant difference between the values concerning tensile resilience. The fabric that has been applied with plasma following treatment with sericin and glutaraldehyde exhibits a significantly lower value in comparison to the control. The fixation of the sericin/glutaraldehyde on the fabric sample represented in Fig. 4a, and the sericin-treated fabric also shows a higher tensile resilience, which is due to sericin containing random coil α-structure with less β-sheet structure. It is soluble in hot water, and when the temperature drops, the random coil β-structure of the silk is transformed to α-sheet structure, which improves the viscoelastic nature of the silk, resulting in gel formation and giving the coated material increased elasticity and durability21,22.

Bending properties

A higher fabric bending rigidity means stiff fabric and its drape are low. Similarly, too low a value of bending rigidity means that the fabric would be too flexible or supplied. For good drapability, a certain minimum bending rigidity is required. To impart higher bending rigidity (B) and hysteresis (2HB), it is necessary to subject the fabric to finishing treatment. These treatments increase the fabric rigidity and elastic recovery from bending. A larger value of 2HB means greater fabric inelasticity.

Figures 5, 6, 7 show the values of bending rigidity, bending hysteresis and residual bending strain. Bending rigidity values do not show any significant difference between the treatments, as evidenced by the “t” test. Bending hysteresis also follow the same trend. There is no significant difference in the residual bending strain. However the treatment of plasma improves the adhesion, so MDC/P absorb more sericin glutaraldehyde on the surface of the sample (sample 5) when compared to the untreated samples, so the bending rigidity, residual bending strain value of the treated sample increased represented in Figs. 5, 6, 7. 23,24.

Figure 5 Bending rigidity (B) of samples. Full size image

Figure 6 Bending hysteresis (2HB) of samples. Full size image

Figure 7 Residual bending strain (2HB/B). Full size image

Shear properties

Shear properties are considered to be important for successful draping and fabric forming qualities that are necessary for successful tailoring and garment wear. The shear properties were measured using a KES-FB instrument. The values measured are G (shear rigidity), shear hysteresis at a shear angle of 0.5 degrees (2HG) andshear angle of 5 degrees (2HG5).

Figure 8 shows the shear stiffness (G) of the fabrics. As far as the shear rigidity values are concerned, there is no evidence to show that the treatments have any effect on it. Except for the fabric treated with sericin following pre-treatment with plasma and glutaraldehyde (Sample 5), there was not much difference in other cases. This may be due to the stiffening action of the finishing agent since the combination of glutaraldehyde and sericin was used, which might have led to the stiffening of the fabric.

Figure 8 Shear rigidity (G) of fabrics. Full size image

Figure 9 shows the shear hysteresis at a shear angle of 0.5 degrees (2HG). The shear hysteresis also follows the same trend as the shear rigidity.

Figure 9 Hysteresis of shear (2HG) of fabrics. Full size image

Figure 10 shows the residual shear strain 2HG/G. With the exception of the sericin-glutaraldehyde-treated sample and plasma-sericin-glutaraldehyde-treated sample, the residual shear strain values are not significant. The residual shear strain 2HG/G is found to be highest in plasma- and sericin- and glutaraldehydetreated samples, which indicates that the recovery is less. This is due to the presence of sericin gum, which impedes the recovery of the fabrics from shear.

Figure 10 Residual shear strain (2HG/G). Full size image

During the degumming process the random coil α-structure converted into β-pleated sheets act as the stiffening mechanism in the silk25.

Figure 11 shows the hysteresis of shear at a shear angle of 5 degrees (2HG5). This follows the same trend as shear hysteresis at 0.5°. In particular, sericin and glutaraldehyde treatment show a pronounced effect with respect to shear hysteresis.

Figure 11 Hysteresis of shear (2HG5) of fabrics. Full size image

Figure 12 represents the shear recovery of the fabrics. The values are found to be significant in most of the cases. However, the plasma-treated sample was similar to the control fabric.

Figure 12 Shear recovery (2HG5/G). Full size image

Compression properties

Unlike the tensile, bending, shear and surface properties, compression properties merit special consideration, as they are single values such as drapes. This type of compression refers to transverse compression.Compression properties provide an idea about the handling of the fabric. LC, CE and RC are defined in the same way as LT, ET and RT, respectively. Figures 13, 14, 15, 16 are thevalues obtained from the compression test of the fabrics. LC values are a measure of the linearity of the compression curve. CE describes fabric compressive toughness. RC indicates the rate of fabric elastic recovery. Among the three parameters that are used to represent the compression properties, CE (compression energy) is the most important parameter.

Figure 13 Linearity of compression (LC) of fabrics. Full size image

Figure 14 Compressional energy (CE) of fabrics. Full size image

Figure 15 Compressional resilience (RC) % of fabrics. Full size image

Figure 13 shows that with the exception of plasma- and sericin-glutaraldehyde-treated fabric (Sample 5), the linearity of the compression values are found to be the same for all the samples.When the compression force acts on the substrate's surface, protrude fibers may resist the load. When the load acts on the fiber, yarns come into close contact and are flattened and straightened, at which point inter-yarn and inter-fiber friction, as well as the yarn's bending stiffness, provide compression resistance until all fibers are in contact with one another26. From the SEM image in Fig. 17d the plasma- and sericin-glutaraldehyde-treated fabric showing more uniform surface coating on the fibers, so the distribution of the loadis resisting very high when compared to other samples, and similar trend we observed in the compressional energy values represented in Fig. 14.

Figure 17 (a) Scanning electron microscopic image of 100% cotton control fabric. (b) Scanning electron microscopic image of 65/35 micro-denier polyester/cotton control fabric. (c) Scanning electron microscopic image of 65/35 micro-denier polyester/cotton sericin and glutaraldehyde finished fabric. (d) Scanning electron microscopic image of 65/35 micro-denier polyester/cotton (plasma-treated sericin and glutaraldehyde finished) fabric. Full size image

Figure 15 shows the compressional resilience of the treated samples. With the exception of the glutaraldehyde treated sample (sample 2), there was a significant improvement in other cases. The reason for the low compressibility may be attributed to the stiffening effect. This can be attributed to the reduction in the mechanical restraint in the polyester fabric due to sericinand glutaraldehyde finishing. Morooka et al.27concluded that a combination of CE and RC can reflectthe softness of the fabric. Higher CE values accompanied by lower RC values generally lead to a softer fabric.

In Fig. 16, the percentage compression, which is a nonstandard parameter, shows a significant difference insamples 2, 3, and 5, glutaraldehydetreated sample, sericinand glutaraldehydetreated fabric and plasma- and sericinglutaraldehydetreated fabric respectively.

Surface properties

Surface properties are related to the smoothness of fabrics and are represented by MIU, MMD and SMD. MIU is the ratio of the average frictional force to the normal load. MMD (mean deviation of MIU) gives the variability in the MIU value along with the fabric. The geometrical roughness (SMD) gives the average vertical displacement of the piano wire tip with reference to the mean surface layer of the fabric.

At a magnification of 5000, Fig. 17a offers a clear image of individual fibres in a 100% cotton fabric. Figure 18, shows that the MIU value is high in the case of sericin and glutaraldehyde samples and the case of plasma and sericin cum glutaraldehyde samples shown in Fig. 17c,d when compared to control represented in Fig. 17b. The increase in friction is due to the increase in the area of contact caused by the presence of sericin and glutaraldehyde. Figure 19 shows the mean deviation of MIU (MMD) and does not show any significant difference.

Figure 18 Co-efficient of friction (MIU) of samples. Full size image

Figure 19 Mean deviation of MIU (MMD). Full size image

The variation in fabric surface roughness is depicted in Fig. 20. With the exception of glutaraldehydetreated fabric, all the other samples show an increase in surface roughness. The surface roughness increases with the glutaraldehydetreated sample, sericin and glutaraldehyde finish and plasma finished with sericin and glutaraldehyde samples compared to the control sample.

Figure 20 Geometrical roughness (SMD) of samples. Full size image

Evaluation of fabric hand

Tables 2 and 3 shows the primary hand values (PHVs) and total hand values (THVs) for the textiles.The sensation of contact of fabric, which is relevant to the garment handle properties is the sensory comfort of garments. The subjective evaluation of textiles based on the sensation of touch has already been termed fabric handling. Fabric itchiness is determined by the diameter of fibers, fabric density at higher and lower pressures, and garment surface finish. The plasma-treated sample aids in the absorption of additional moisture, and the presence of moisture on the skin surface increases the intensity of fabric roughness sensations due to frictional changes.It is apparent that the plasma-treated sample displays a higher value, and the other values are comparable.

Table 2 Primary Hand Values. Full size table

Table 3 Total hand values. Full size table

In Fig. 21 all the treated samples are not very much different from the control which shows that there is no measurable difference in handle following the treatments given to them. In other words, there was no deterioration in the handling of micro denierpolyester fabric due to the treatments.

Figure 21 Total hand value. Full size image

ANOVA analysis of various factors

ANOVA was carried out for low-stress mechanical properties between treated and untreated fabrics. The results are given in Table 4, and it shows that there is no significant difference between various properties. However, between the treatments,there was a significant difference.",,[],"['Rajalakshmi', 'Department Of Costume Design', 'Fashion', 'Vet Institute Of Arts', 'Science College', 'Thindal', 'Erode', 'Kubera Sampath Kumar', 'Department Of Chemical Engineering', 'Textile Technology']"

Bio-Inspired Textiles Promote Sustainable Fashion,"While color is one of the primary indicators of sales success within the fashion industry, it’s also one of the world’s largest sources of water pollution. In fact, textile mills often dump residual dyes and hazardous chemicals into canals, streams and rivers.

At NC State, researchers from the College of Natural Resources and the Wilson College of Textiles have developed a process that could someday solve this problem — and it involves the use of nanoscopic particles extracted from wood.

“Textile mills use dyes and other coloration agents that are very toxic,” said Nathalie Lavoine, an assistant professor in the Department of Forest Biomaterials. “Using nanocellulose is a way forward to sustainable processing.”

Nanocellulose is a naturally occurring substance extracted from cellulose — the main substance of a plant’s cell walls. It’s divided into two types: nanocrystals and nanofibrils, both of which are biodegradable and non-toxic. The former is also stronger than steel.

With funding from the Research Opportunity Seed Fund Program at the Wilson College of Textiles, Lavoine and her collaborators have developed a process that allows them to use nanocellulose to produce clothing items with iridescent features resembling the rainbow-hued shimmer seen on fish scales, bird feathers and insect bodies.

“Researchers have known how to make iridescent films with these nanoparticles,” Lavoine said. “But until now, there was no way to apply these particles to textiles.”

Using nanocrystals extracted from wood, Lavoine and her collaborators can print iridescent designs on clothing items. Photo provided.

The researchers extract cellulose from wood chips and the pulp used in papermaking and combine it with water, treating the resulting mixture with acid to uncover nanocrystals. They then purify the mixture to remove undesired components.

Once the purification process is complete, the researchers add the mixture to frames so that it can solidify into plastic-like films. Then, using a computer-aided design table, they cut the films into shapes and patterns that can be printed onto clothing items.

Lavoine said the use of nanocellulose in textiles ensures the sustainable use of natural resources, opening a path for novel uses of both low-grade wood and traditional timber sources. It could also reduce dye pollution from the fashion industry.

The United Nations Environmental Programme found that not only is the dyeing process for fabrics the second largest source of water pollution, but that the fashion industry alone is producing 20% of the world’s wastewater.

While Lavoine and her collaborators haven’t figured out how to provide all colors, they’re currently working on it. They’re also testing the application of nanocellulose on a variety of other items, including phone cases.

“We can extend this work to much more than textiles,” Lavoine said. “The only limit is our imagination.”

Lavoine and her collaborators recently presented their work at the 2022 ACCelerate Festival in Washington, D.C. The three-day event, hosted at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, showcases “creative exploration and research at the nexus of science, engineering, arts and design” across the Atlantic Coast Conference.

Going forward, the researchers will collaborate with NSF I-Corps to commercialize their work. The training program aims to help NC State researchers transition their ideas and inventions into the marketplace through customer discovery and market research.

“There’s still a lot of research to be done,” Lavoine said. “But ultimately, we’d like to find one or two industry partners who can bring commercial value to this project.”",,[],['Andrew Moore']

Hemp to be promoted in textile industry,"Hemp to be promoted in textile industry

Products manufactured from hemp fibres, including these hats, are being promoted by the International Trade Promotion Department.

The Commerce Ministry looks set to promote and upgrade hemp fibre in the Thai textile industry as it offers high potential in the global market under the popular bio-, circular and green economic model.

According to Phusit Ratanakul Sereroengrit, director-general of the International Trade Promotion Department, the plan aligns with the government's ongoing efforts to push hemp as a new potential economic crop for commercial use.

Hemp and cannabis had been classified as narcotics under Category 5 under the Narcotics Act of Thailand for many years. The extensive medicinal properties of both cannabis and hemp have long been known.

In 2019, the possession and use of cannabis for medical and research purposes under certain conditions was legalised for the first time in Thailand.

In December 2020, the legalisation of cannabis and hemp became more concrete and conspicuous after many parts of the cannabis and hemp cultivated in Thailand were allowed to be exempted from being considered narcotics under Category 5 through a notification from the Public Health Ministry.

In early 2022, declassification of cannabis and hemp happened via another Public Health Ministry notification published in the Royal Gazette on Feb 9.

This notification ""unlocked"" cannabis and hemp from narcotic classification, creating opportunities for the general public and business owners to use them for a wider range of purposes.

""The department foresaw the potential to promote hemp in textiles and products for export because it is a natural fibre with many special properties,"" said Mr Phusit.

""The production process is environmentally friendly and able to respond to global market trends.""

The world market for textiles and garments made from fibres and hemp products is now estimated at more than 140 billion baht, with the figures expected to grow by 22.4% between 2022 and 2027 based on growing demand.

In a move to capitalise on the global trend, the International Trade Promotion Department established a project to develop and promote the export of textiles and garments made from fibres and hemp products to tap into market demand worldwide.

In-depth market information and business development guidelines for hemp products will be provided to support Thai entrepreneurs to develop their products and enable them to compete in international markets.

In the first quarter of 2022, Thai textile product exports (excluding textile housing) tallied US$1.72 billion, up by 13.8% year-on-year. The most important export markets included the US, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, India and Germany.

The major export products comprised garments worth $602 million (34.9%), fabric and yarn worth $552 million (32%) and other textiles including artificial fibres, embroidered and lace fabrics, fishing nets, tailoring and crafted fabrics, shawls and scarves worth a combined $571 million (33.1%).",,[],"['Bangkok Post Public Company Limited', 'Phusadee Arunmas']"

"Seaweed Protein Market Size To Reach $1,397.7 Million by 2030, says P&S Intelligence","NEW YORK, June 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In 2021, the worldwide seaweed protein market was worth around $513.7 million, which is set to touch $1,397.7 million by 2030, growing at an 11.8% CAGR from 2021 to 2030, according to the latest market research study published by P&S Intelligence. A growing trend is protein extraction from eatable seaweeds for a variety of health purposes. Alternative protein sources are preferred since, unlike cow ranching, they do not take up additional land or cause greenhouse gas emissions while being cultivated.

Highest Revenue Generator Is Protein Extracted from Red Seaweeds

In 2021, proteins produced from red seaweeds accounted for an over 70% share in the seaweed protein market. Red seaweeds account for over half of all the seaweed farming practiced globally. Nori, a red seaweed with a protein level of up to 47%, has the highest measured protein content. Humans use red seaweed mostly as a binder in food items and as a bacterial substrate in labs.

Key Findings of Seaweed Protein Market Report

The various non-food uses of seaweeds, such as nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, animal feed, biofertilizers/bio-stimulants, cosmetics, bio-packaging, carbon capture or sequestration, biofuels, and textile fibers, are projected to drive the market growth in the future.

Because of their health, nutritional, and socioeconomic benefits, seaweed proteins are becoming a popular alternative protein source throughout the world.

In the year 2021, the food sector accounted for over 80% of the total income from the sale of seaweed proteins. Product consumption in the food sector continues to be driven by the increasing demand for seaweed snacks and growing popularity of Japanese cuisine.

Conventional methods of extraction held a 55% share of the seaweed protein market in the past. When compared to other approaches, seaweed extracts made using the conventional alkaline process give higher yields.

Seaweed production in China is the world's highest. China's eight farmed seaweed species can provide protein equivalent to 3 million tons of rice, 1.5 million tons of pork, 11 million tons of spinach, and 15 million tons of potatoes in a year.

Regional Analysis

The utilization of hydrocolloids and seaweeds in APAC accounts for almost 60% of the seaweed protein market share. China has surpassed the U.S. as the leading importer of non-edible and edible seaweed for processing. Similarly, behind China, the Philippines is the world's second-largest supplier of processed and semi-processed carrageenan. Carrageenan exports from the Philippines have surged by more than 40% in the last 10 years.

Your Wardrobe Staples Could Be Made From Fermented Protein Fibres,"3 Mins Read

Alternative material innovator and casual wear brand Pangaia Lab has announced the launch of a capsule collection powered by Brewed Protein, a biomaterial made by Spiber. The collection includes the NXT GEN Hoodie, a sweater that contains 88 percent organic cotton, with the remaining 12 percent of fibres supplied by Brewed Protein.

Spiber and Pangaia have worked together to prove that sustainable bio-based fabric technology is ready to scale. The Brewed Protein development is offered as an alternative to animal-derived and carbon-emitting fabrics. The final NXT GEN hoodie is a showcase of the synthetic material, which has been created using DNA found in nature as its inspiration.

Growing sustainable fabrics

Pangaia and Spiber are aiming to disrupt material production with their collaborative bio-fabric created using fermentation technology. The process requires DNA codes to be identified from nature, before being built upon to create a totally new material, free from petrochemical bases.

The need for sustainable materials, according to Pangaia, has never been greater. Continued use of synthetic materials, based on fossil fuels, is creating irreparable harm to the planet. The brand cites polyester and polyurethane as major offenders, with both contributing to water toxicity, air and land pollution and climate change.

Spiber has created a database of DNA sequences from various natural organisms. From here, it designs an entirely new variation and synthesises it. The unique DNA is inserted into microbes that are given sugar-based feedstocks to break down and allow fermentation to begin. Polymers are created by fermentation and removed from process residue, resulting in a protein powder that can be spun into fibres. When combined with organic cotton, the Brewed Protein is stable and suitable for transforming into clothing. The NXT Gen Hoodie acts as proof of concept and complexity.

The antithesis of fast fashion

To look at, the hoodie is unextraordinary. It could pass for a regular cotton sweatshirt, barring the customary white type paragraph on the front that details the production process. The price tag, however, will garner attention. Costing £305, the jumper does not represent democratic access to earth-friendly materials. It is, however, a stark reminder that sustainability doesn’t always manage to make price parity a priority.

Current predictions state that by 2030, the global population will have exceeded 8.5 billion. Spiber states that if the Paris Agreement is going to stand any chance of being fulfilled, at least one in every five items of clothing will need to align with a circular production model. This ties in with the E.U.’s decision to implement rules surrounding product quality. The new directive will seek to ensure clothes sold within Europe are infinitely more repairable, longer-lasting and easy to recycle at end of life.

Pangaia’s history of sustainable capsule launches

As a brand, Pangaia was founded on principles of ethical fashion. To date, it has launched seaweed-based active wear, zero-waste trainers, nettle fibre denim and more. Its most recent development was a partnership with Colorifix to use bacteria-based dyes that would negate synthetic dye run-off. Pangaia debuted pink and blue items within its 365 capsule collection, launched in December last year.

As with most previous launches, the new NXT GEN Hoodie will feature a digital passport. The idea was launched by Pangaia in may last year and adds a QR code to care labels which, when scanned, show life cycle information about the garment and offers full transparency about manufacturing methods.

"Quality Fabric Of The Month: Luxury, Lab-Grown Leather","VitroLabs’ cell-cultivated leather offers an environmentally- and animal-friendly alternative to traditional leather.

By Rachael S. Davis, Executive Editor

Many man-made leather alternatives can lack the lasting, high-quality found in real leather and aren’t necessarily much more environmentally friendly than leather processing — an energy and water intensive processes that consumes many chemicals. There are companies in the marketplace working on plant-based leather alternatives and interest is picking up in such products.

One company new on the scene, VitroLabs, Milpitas, Calif., has entered the arena with a completely different approach. Aiming to design animal farming out of leather production, VitroLabs has engineered a cell-cultivated product that begins with a cow biopsy to harvest just a few cells. Using a specialized bioreactor along with the right nutrients and signals, those few seed cells become an animal hide in just a few weeks. That hide can then move straight to the tanning process, significantly reducing the environmental impact. The process is also much more favorable for animal welfare.

According to the company, those seed cells can be turned into billions of square feet of leather by reproducing the natural conditions required for those skin cells to regenerate indefinitely. The finished material contains a variety of proteins that are needed to produce a durable product with the luxurious finish and complexity of traditional hides.

“At a time when environmental stewardship is more important than ever, biotech companies have the opportunity to lead the way in changing how we produce materials and build supply chains, working hand in hand with existing artisans and craftspeople who are the cornerstone of the $400 billion leather goods industry,” said VitroLabs Co-Founder and CEO Ingvar Helgason. “By launching the first production of cultivated leather, we’ll hit a major milestone in fulfilling our mission to lead the shift towards a more sustainable future.”

Last fall, VitroLabs moved into a new facility designed for pilot production and featuring laboratory space. The company also recently raised $46 million in Series A financing that will help build and scale the pilot production facility. The funding was led by Agronomics, with Bestseller’s Invest FWD, Kering, Khosla Ventures, actor Leonardo DiCaprio, New Agrarian and Regeneration.VC also contributing.

“At Regeneration.VC, we view break-through applications of synthetic biology like VitroLabs as crucial to reimagining environmentally degrading materials like conventional leather,” said Michael Smith, general partner, Regeneration.VC. “There are near term shifts to enable the scaling of bioreactors along with improvements in growth media that point to the possibility of scaled production and significant margin potential in SynBio. We see a multi-billion-dollar opportunity to displace traditional leather supply chains. With a mission-aligned ecosystem of brands, manufacturers, and consumers, VitroLabs will leverage proprietary technology to unlock a next-generation material.”

“There has been an explosion of companies that are developing alternative materials to leather,” Helgason noted. “However at VitroLabs, our cultivated animal leather preserves the biological characteristics that the industry, craftsmen, and consumers know and love about leather, while eliminating the most environmentally and ethically detrimental aspects of the conventional leather manufacturing process associated with its sourcing.”

May/June 2022",,[],['Rachael Davis']
Animal agriculture doesn’t stand a chance,"In its recent Rethinking Food and Agriculture 2020-2030 report, RethinkX, an economic disruption think-tank, proposes that new technologies will not just disrupt food proteins like those found in meat or milk, but also proteins found in a whole host of products, like leather and other materials.

This is because these new technologies have the potential to give us access to cheaper and better alternatives to many textiles and materials we use today and the winners will always be those that are superior and cheaper, meaning the disruption is inevitable from an economic point of view. However, unlike food, the barriers to entry are easier for materials companies – this will be a B2B driven disruption, with no regulation to hinder the growth of the new technologies.

The disruptive companies in the next generation material space are not dissimilar to those currently taking the food world by storm. There are new plant-based alternatives, ranging from the use of new materials such as pineapple leaves by Piñatex, or new manufacturing routes for biobased materials like Natural Fiber Welding, to fermentation-derived alternatives like Bolt Thread’s Mylo, Mycoworks’ Reishi, and Spiber’s precision fermented Brewed Protein, as well as cellular agriculture-based products, with VitroLabs, for example, growing hides from cells. These technologies will work in parallel to disrupt traditional materials.

Economic led disruption

Products from the cow like milk, meat and leather are particularly susceptible to this disruption. The industries are interlinked, in that dairy cows can be used for beef and leather can come from dairy or beef stock, but these are the minority. In the main, the industries operate separately, and with highly volatile margins. It is likely that any disruption to beef and milk will also lead to the disruption of leather.

Hides are limited in size, quality is highly variable, the supply chain is low-margin with a highly fragmented value-chain and the production time is very long

Cow-based leather is the most abundant animal-derived material out there. Today, the leather industry is an $80 billion manufacturing sector, with exports of hides and skins alone exceeding $5 billion annually. The annual global leather goods market was valued at almost $400 billion in 2020, with around half being footwear.

Bovine leather makes up about 65% of the global leather market and the primary raw materials for the leather industry are hides which are a waste product from the meat processing industry.

Inefficiency

The leather industry is deeply inefficient. Hides are limited in size, quality is highly variable, the supply chain is low-margin with a highly fragmented value-chain and the production time is very long. As such, there is a lot of waste – not only from the processing part, but also simply in dealing with the non-conventional shapes that animal skins come in. This leads to wastage – in some cases about 30-40% of a cow hide by area and almost 80% by weight is lost in this process. In weight terms this is even more significant – in leather processing one metric ton of raw material is converted into only 200kg of usable leather product. The quality variability means hides are graded from A (the best) to E (the least good), with only 2-4% of hides being graded A. As a result, A grade hides are sold out years in advance, as the luxury goods houses seek to secure their supply. The processing of hides also requires significant amounts of water and can produce toxic waste effluent.

However, in recent years the mismatch between the desire for meat and the desire for leather has meant that in some regions, we see buffalo being bred predominantly for their hides, while in other regions the hides are being thrown away, as they have no economic use. It is the supply and demand imbalances between the parts of the cow that leads to economic imbalances. In another twist, the growing improvement in faux leather – plastic-based leather – has contributed to this change in supply-demand dynamics.

Improving technologies

One of the first faux leathers was made of layered and treated paper pulp. Called Presstoff, it came to prominence in World War I in Germany due to the rationing of animal-based leather. Since then, technologies have continued to get better.

While the quality is not quite on a par with animal leather for some uses, faux leathers are far cheaper – synthetic (plastic-based) alternative leathers are about a third the cost of animal-based leather. Today about two thirds of the overall “leather” market by volume and a third by value is taken up with these alternative leathers. As such, the synthetic leather market is currently worth about $28 billion.

This growth has not come without consequences. Synthetic, faux or vegan leathers are predominantly made of plastic. This comes with all the environmental downsides of any plastic-based material, derived from fossil fuels. Many of the next-gen materials, however, are bio-based, cheaper and in many ways better. How we determine if a material is better than another, however, depends on a variety of factors – durability and aesthetics, as well as how a material performs on sustainability metrics.

Profit

There are very few, if any, instances where consumers would purchase a hide directly from a cow, or even a sheet of tanned leather. This is because companies, not consumers, decide what raw materials to use in their products. Companies seek to maximise revenue – lower their input costs while still keeping the quality high enough so they can continue to make a profit. Companies will switch to a different raw material as soon as there is an economically viable alternative. Furthermore, since materials typically go on the body instead of inside it, there are far fewer regulatory hurdles and personal trepidations – like emotional or cultural attachment – that could arise compared to food. Because of this, and because of the high price tags of many products, the barrier to entry is far lower and thus the bulk of the disruption of materials could very well occur before the disruption of food.

Proteins

Another way to think about this is that leather is often an ingredient in the end product sold to consumers, like shoes, handbags or the seating interior of a car. With alternative leathers, we are not just seeing products made from only one new or old technology, but we are seeing biotechnology used to enhance other biobased materials, so-called “bio-alloys”. Using these proteins as ingredients and building the materials up using technology in new ways comes with property enhancing benefits like better colour-fastness, with implications for dye run-off, for example.

Today about two thirds of the overall “leather” market by volume and a third by value is taken up with these alternative leathers. As such, the synthetic leather market is currently worth about $28 billion

The major driver of disruptions is economic, but there are other influencing factors that affect the adoption of new products. With leather, depending on the application, properties such as thickness, suppleness, finish, durability, permeability, size, warmth etc., are all important. Leather from cows, however, is constrained by biology. The glacial pace of evolution limits improvements that can be made to its properties. Improvements in processing technologies can only go so far. Not so for leather produced through new technologies.

Endless possibilities

With next-gen materials the possibilities are endless. There is so much more customisation that can occur because the raw materials are individual proteins and fibres that can be assembled in an infinite number of ways. There is also no reason that the modern products that replace leather goods need to be made using bovine proteins – they just need to replace (or exceed) the old product’s function. More likely than not, leather goods will be replaced by materials that are far superior in every way. What is impossible for cows to produce, becomes possible. Materials of any size or texture, with any properties desired like changing colour with the temperature or glowing in the dark are not science fiction – there are many proteins in nature that have far better properties than bovine collagen. Spider silk protein, for example, is stronger than steel, but farming spiders is close to impossible. But with new technology it becomes possible – it could for example be used for highly durable covers for car seats, or hard-wearing clothing or unbreakable ropes.

This is why, as soon as costs and capacity allow, these next generation products will capture market share quickly.

The S-curve

What happens if the disruption of leather is faster than expected?

History tells us that all technology adoption follows an S-curve. Why should next generation leather be any different? At the same time, every other part of the cow is seeing the development of good enough and cheap enough alternatives. If any one of these developments happens quicker than expected, this would have knock on effects for all parts of the cow. If you take away the revenue contributed by, for example, leather, the cost of the cow falls on fewer components, pushing up prices. This in turn changes the cost equation for other next-gen materials and the effect can quickly magnify as individual components are substituted, in turn leaving less and less of the cow as a valuable output.

Supply and demand

Because animals have a fixed composition, farmers and meatpackers cannot adjust production to compensate. In fact, if meatpackers can’t sell a certain part of the animal to secondary processors or consumers, they can raise the price of the other parts, cut processing costs, or pay farmers less for the animal. To balance, farmers may then need to adjust the size of their herd, purchase lower-cost inputs or alter their timelines – none of which can happen overnight. Changes in the supply or demand of any one part affect the economics of all the other parts even if the products are supplying different industries. New technologies have the flexibility and adaptability to change these ratios immediately.

Margins

Materials will be a crucial part of this process because, while with cattle, the value of the hide is worth 2-5% of a slaughtered steer’s value, a relatively small amount, (the beef is worth over 90%), the loss of this additional revenue could be significant. Profit margins in the beef cattle industry are volatile and in single digits.

If the leather industry shifts to next-gen leathers, this would mean reduced demand for cattle hides and thus a 2-5% drop in the amount of money earned per animal – leaving the meatpacker with damaged margins. While an instantaneous and complete disruption is unlikely to occur, a prolonged decrease in the demand for cattle hides will have a serious impact on the profits of meatpackers and therefore of farmers. With demand for all other by-products and beef simultaneously being chipped away, animal agriculture doesn’t stand a chance in the longer term.

Leaf-meridian bio-inspired nanofibrous electronics with uniform distributed microgrid and 3D multi-level structure for wearable applications,"Special morphology and structure of prepared TPPCN membrane

Figure 1 depicts the typical technological route of preparation mimicking meridian system of nature frond leaves (Fig. 1a) to obtain enhanced performance. The flexible substrate, an electrospinning PU/CCNTs (named PCN) membrane (Fig. 1b (I)) is firstly prepared using a metal mesh as receiving device. Fig. S1 is a digital picture of prepared PU membrane, showing an interesting grid-like morphology. Test results of the contact angle verify the transformation of properties from super-hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity (Fig. 2k) after plasma treatment. Subsequently, it can be observed the gray PCN turns yellow (Fig. 1b (II)) after immersion of EtOH-Fe3+ solution. Combined with the scanning results of EDS mapping and XRD, a uniform distribution of Fe and Cl elements (Fig. S2), indicating a healthy attachment of Fe3+. Thereby, facile in situ polymerization of EDOT reacts on the surface of PCN-Fe3+, followed by the ultrasonic treatment. Black conductive CCNTs/PEDOT@PCN (named TPPCN) membrane is finally obtained (Fig. 1b (IV)). Typical TPPCN membrane with thickness of 0.7 mm is shown in Fig. 1c. Grid-like morphology is perfectly preserved from substrate, as well as the multi-level structure revealed by the SEM images of cross-section (Fig. 1c (II–V)). Moreover, Fig. S3 shows a typical three-dimensional (3D) image of microgrid morphology. The regular grid-like structure is evenly distributed on the surface with a center height of around 50 μm. More importantly, TPPCN membrane also remains flexible enough to be bent and folded into some other shape (Fig. 1d).

More efforts are spared to investigate the variation of morphology and structure composition during the membrane forming. Compared with pure PU membrane, doping of CCNTs and CA significantly increase the conductivity of spinning solution, resulting in thinner and finer PCN nanofibers (Fig. 2a, b)33. The average diameter is reduced from approximately 0.76 to 0.53 μm. Treatment of EtOH-Fe3+ solution causes appreciable crimping and swelling (Fig. 2c), accompanied by little increase in diameter (0.64 μm). Afterward, it continues to increase to 0.77 μm after in situ polymerization of PEDOT for 18 h (Fig. 2d). PEDOT layer forms as irregular scales wrapped around the nanofibers, which is confirmed in Fig. S4 and results in a rough surface. Whereas, the 3D porous networks structure is retained very well. Details of normal distribution for each sample’s diameter are supplied in Fig. S5. Meanwhile, Fig. 2g demonstrates a TEM image of PPCN nanofibers, obvious core-shell structure with a continuous-coating PEDOT shell layer is observed. Furthermore, the CCNTs are anchored onto the surface of PCCN under the assistance of ultrasonication to prepare the TPPCN membrane. Naturally, more CCNTs would be anchored onto the PPCN nanofiber surface with prolonging ultrasonication time (Fig. S6). Time of 45 min is necessary, as shown in Fig. 2e. Many entangled CCNTs are observed to wrap on the nanofiber surface. Figure 2f, h are enlarged morphology of TPPCN membrane and TEM image. The porosity test results of the nanofiber membrane are shown in Fig. 2l. Totally the variation of porosity and diameter tends to be opposite, means that the larger the fiber diameter, the lower the porosity. And the polymerization significantly reduces the porosity. Finally, EDS mapping and XPS tests of the TPPCN membrane in Fig. 2i and S7 further demonstrates the uniform distribution of S (unique to PEDOT, Fig. S8 shows a typical chemical structure of PEDOT and anion polymerization process), Fe3+, Cl, C and O elements on fiber surface.

Apart from the morphology and microstructure, FT-IR results (Fig. 2j) also confirm the composition variation of the fiber membrane during the preparation process. The characteristic bands at 1072 cm−1, 1595 cm−1, and 1721 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration of C-O, plane bending vibration of N-H and the free hydrogen-bonded carbonyl groups in the urethane linkage (-H-N-COO-) in the spectrum of pure PU, respectively. Also, peaks at 2955 cm−1 and 3334 cm−1 are caused by the stretching vibration of -CH 3 and overlap stretching vibration of N-H. Particularly, typical characteristic bonds belong to vibration of -OH is observed at 3496 cm−1 in the curve of PCN after the introduction of CA. For PPCN membrane, pure PEDOT sample prepared with the same process is tested to do a comparison. Accordingly, characteristic bands of PEDOT are observed, including the peaks at 1533 cm−1 and 1358 cm−1 of the carbon skeleton of thiophene ring, 690 cm−1, 834 cm−1, and 980 cm−1 attributed to the vibration of C–S–C and 1215 cm−1 belonged to C–O–C, respectively.

Electromechanical properties of TPPCN membrane

Prepared nanofibrous membrane exhibits good flexibility and stretchability. Typical tensile strain-stress curves of all samples are provided in Fig. 3a. Compared with pure PU membrane, doping of CCNT significantly improves the rigidity of PCN, which is consistence with previous works23. Also, sacrifice of mechanical performance is inevitable owing to repeated and long treatment, in which substrate was wetted and dried by the solvent. PPCN membrane shows a reduced flexibility (1.21 MPa and 41.5%). Synchronously, the high energy of ultrasonic process will damage the nanofibrous structure. Thus, strength of TPPCN possess slight decrease (0.92 MPa), while there is no significant variation in elongation. Figure 3b shows the electrical conductivity of prepared samples with different situ polymerization time (2–36 h). Pure PU is no-conductive. Despite CCNT with content of 1 wt% is doped, resistance of PCN membrane cannot be tested by multimeter (å 109 Ω). While, conductivity of PPCN dramatically improves to ~0.5 S cm−1 only after in situ polymerization for 2 h. And it continues to increase to ~26.3 S cm−1 (18 h) with the prolonging polymerization time and increased fiber diameter. Especially, great stability and durability are confirmed by stable conductivity (Fig. S9), where PPCN membrane was placed in acid (pH = 2), alkali (pH = 12) and salt ion solution (NaCl, 0.1 M), ethanol for more than 6 h. However, as we mentioned long-term solvent immersion will seriously damage the structure of PPCN membrane, resulting in a sharp decline in mechanical properties. Even, the PPCN membrane becomes fragile and could not withstand further ultrasonic modification when the polymerization time exceeded 36 h. Time of 18 h is optimized and used as an appropriate final parameter in this work, after which conductivity will not increase obviously indicating a completely coating and conductive paths. Additionally, the existence of PEDOT layer has made the conductivity of the PPCN membrane at a high level and the modification by CCNTs would not further improve the conductivity of the TPPCN samples (Fig. S10 shows the conductivity of TPPCN membrane after ultrasonic treatment for different time). Due to the high conductivity, TPPCN membrane can be used as a conductor in the circuit to light a LED bulb or others electronic devices. We also show its application as touch sensors. In an interesting illustration, TPPCN membrane used as sensing units is weaved onto a cotton fabric with a formation of 2 × 2 integrated array enables an touch sensor (Fig. 3d). Another functional processor is manufactured in bread board, thus it could distinguish different touch positions as demonstrated by lighting the corresponding LEDs connected in the TPPCN membrane.

The error bars presented in the plots represent the standard deviations of the respective measurements. Full size image

Furthermore, pressure sensing property is investigated using the TPPCN membrane as the target. The current-voltage (I–V) curves shown in Fig. 3c, depict the relative change of current varies with different applied pressure. The TPPCN membrane demonstrates linear I–V characteristics with a relatively stable response to pressure, and it is confirmed to the Ohm’s law during the whole testing range. For the pressure sensitivity, gauge factor (GF) is used to evaluate the pressure sensitivity (S), and it is defined as

$${{{\mathrm{GF}}}} = \frac{{{{{\mathrm{R}}}}_0 - {{{\mathrm{R}}}}}}{{{{{\mathrm{R}}}} \times \Delta {{{\mathrm{P}}}}}}$$ (1)

where R, R 0 and ΔP denote the real-time, initial resistance, and variation in pressure, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3e, there are three linear resistance segments clearly can be found during the dynamic instantaneous resistance response to varying pressure, which detailly manifested as a sharp increase in the low-pressure range, a gradual increase in the intermediate-pressure and stable tendency in high-pressure range. Thus, it is correspondingly calculated to be of 5.13 (0–1.0 kPa) and 0.41 kPa−1 (1.0–8.0 kPa), respectively. Particularly, TPPCN membrane shows ultralow response limit. Although noise signals are unavoidable, it is confirmed to distinguish the pressure of ~1 Pa (Fig. S11) and shows great repeatability in several repeated signals. Besides, when applying force on the TPPCN pressure sensing unit, it offers a short response time of ∼80 ms and recovery time of ~120 ms (Fig. 3f), which is fast enough for most of the practical applications. In particular, compared with TPPCN membrane with multi-level structure and grid-like morphology, blank sample shows a ~100% decline in the sensibility (~2.46 kPa−1), as well as an increased response/recovery time, indicating an enhanced sensing properties and effective microstructure. Figure 3g shows a response of TPPCN membrane to the pulsed pressure of 250 Pa, 1.0 kPa, and 5.0 kPa with an increased frequency from 0.5 to 1.0 Hz, and the reversible and reproducible electronic signal reveal good stability. Also, the long-term stability is further be investigated in 1000 repetitive cycles of repeated loading/unloading process, as illustrated in Fig. 3h. The inset shows a magnified region of the electrical responses. The output signal is almost identical and identifiable in each cycle. Thus, we believe that the TPPCN membrane possesses a long service life and exhibits good stability for practical applications. Finally, Fig. 3i and Table. S1 show a comparison of the sensing properties with similar reported works. Compared with nanofibrous membrane-based pressure sensors, it is in a high level. At the same time, the preparation process is of great convenience, expansibility and universality, which is important for commercialization.

Mechanism discussion and model analysis

To understand the working mechanism of TPPCN membrane pressure sensor, we observe and simplify the gap variation between the spatial multi-level layers during the loading process, which is shown in Fig. 4a–c. Generally, it can be seen that the contact areas among each layer of TPPCN membrane increases with the applied pressure on the surface, which will generate more charge transport channels and result in the decline of resistance. A basic sensing unit with two-layer structure is simplified to postulate an equivalent circuit model. Thus, the resistance can be calculated by the equation:

$$\frac{1}{{{{\mathrm{R}}}}} = \frac{1}{{{{{\mathrm{R}}}}_{{{\mathrm{L}}}}}} + \frac{{{{\mathrm{L}}}}}{{{{{\mathrm{R}}}}_{{{\mathrm{L}}}} + {{{\mathrm{nR}}}}_{{{\mathrm{C}}}}}}$$ (2)

where R L , R C , and n are the resistance of single lay of TPPCN, contact interface, and the number of contact junction. During the whole loading process, R L remains unchanged, while R C will decrease with increased pressure, accompanied by varied contact distance and the number of contact junction. In the initial stage, the decrease in the contact distance results in dramatic enhancement of contact junction due to the effective interlocking between surfaces of each layer, which further leads to the total resistance to decrease rapidly. Therefore, a high GF value can be obtained. Then, the variation of resistance decreases slowly with increasing pressure, as new contact junction was difficult to form. Finally, it becomes steady in the high-pressure region. At this stage, all layers of the TPPCN membrane are in contact with each other in a flattened form.

Full size image

Moreover, as is widely accepted that a high and local stress concentration will be produced at the protrusions surrounding special surface34,35. It means an enhanced optimized efficiency of the contact area under the same applied force, which is beneficial to improve the sensibility and response/recovery time. To investigate the pressure distribution on the surface of TPPCN membrane, we simulate the pressure distribution on the grid-like morphology as well as another three microstructure that can be easily obtained by the template method, including pyramid, hemisphere, and cylinder (more simulation and modeling information are available in characterization section and Fig. S12). As shown in Fig. 4d–g, a loading of 5 kPa is applied and all these samples possess the stress concentration on their top protrusions area. Nevertheless, owing to sharper structure, more uneven stress distributions are observed from the samples of pyramid hemisphere, and cylinder structure. And samples of TPPCN membrane display more homogeneous pressure distribution along the altitude direction. Particularly, applied pressure can be transmitted to the root segment of adjacent peaks, indicating a small deformation in low pressure range. We believe that these architectural features endow them with different characteristics to meet the various requirements of the target application. Detailly, for our prepared sample, on the one hand, microgrid morphology enables TPPCN membrane to produce faster and larger deformation responses to pressure stimuli at smaller initial contact interfaces, resulting in a faster response time and 200% increase in initial GF value (compared with TPPCN-blank). Another key point to mention is the rough surface formed by the CCNTs loading, which is of great significance to the enhancement of detection limit and response time (Fig. S13). The CCNTs-modified surface enables the TPPCN membrane to produce stable signal response even under low stress. On the other hand, when the initial contact junctios at the top stress region achieve saturation in small deformation and loading force. The spatial multi-level interlocking structures provide more new contact junctions at high pressures. Similarly, enhanced contact areas caused by them can further compensate for the whole resistance variation. Therefore, the relative resistance variation still exhibits linearity within the large pressure range. To sum up, synergistic contribution of spatial multi-level structure and grid-like morphology enables a fast response/recover time, good sensibility, and wide-range detection linearity of TPPCN membrane.

Versatile applications of the TPPCN membrane

Owing to the good electromechanical performance of the prepared TPPCN membrane, it can be potentially used as wearable electronics. Here, we demonstrate how it can enable various proof-of-concept applications such as tactile strain sensor, temperature sensor, wearable heater, and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). Details of all devices preparation process and characterization are available in supporting information.

We first demonstrate its use as tactile sensor, results are shown in Fig. 5. TPPCN membranes used as sensing unit are assembled into a simple ‘fabric piano’, of which Cu wires and PDMS film are used as signal transmission lines and encapsulation enclosures (inset of Fig. 5a). As shown in Fig. 5a, the fabric piano possesses four signal channels, which can respond to four tactile signals independently at the same time. Before it, we demonstrated the positive relationship between the peak value and applied pressure. Similarly, the diversity of signal peaks is also of great importance for the application of sensors. For instance, a single signal pattern obviously cannot satisfy the vivid melody of piano. Hence, four different kinds of configuration of pressure signals including sine, Arb, half-sine, and square waveforms are vividly imitated with the same magnitude and frequency by controlling the time of pressure and the applied force. What’s more, among these that have been displayed, signal with Arb and square form is selected to combine and simulate interesting Morse signal. As shown in Fig. 5b, well-organized lasting squeezing and rapid tapping could generate a series of signal peaks in a continuous manner that can be identified as points and lines of Morse code. Thus, information with actual meanings can be transformed. A demonstration of the letters including ‘T’, ‘P’, ‘C’, and ‘N’ is displayed as an example. Furthermore, to take advantage of good wearability and processibility, a conventional textile process is utilized to decorate TPPCN membrane to braided fabrics to form a monolithic sensing array (6 cm × 6 cm with 4 × 4 arrays, (Fig. 5c) for force mapping. With the assistance of more signal processors, these sensing fabrics could be used for gravity/pressure sensing in spatial area. As shown in Fig. 5c (II), four objects with weight of 2.5, 4, 7.5, and 45 g are placed at different locations, respectively. Evidently, the pressure distribution of them can be clearly identified with different color in the 3D Plot of R 0 /R of the sensor array. Similarly, in another interesting example, five TPPCN membrane sensors are decorated on the glove. When holding the beaker with 100 mL and 200 mL water with glove, different pressure signals can be monitored, as shown in Fig. 5e. The resistance variation of each sensors is recorded and labeled in the schematic. Also, same experiments were operated using the glove with sensors attached to the arthrosis, a similar pressure distribution can be recorded and obtained when the volunteer hits an object (Fig. 5e). Apart from the pressure sensing applications, this obtained TPPCN membrane also shows an outstanding potential to be used for the detection of physiological signals and body motions. Here, we also do some simple trials, in which TPPCN is attached to a different area in the human body for detecting various motions. As illustrated in Fig. 5d, TPPCN membrane sensors displays a battery of sensitive signals corresponding to finger bending (Fig. 5d (I)), cheek blowing (Fig. 5d (II)), head nodding (Fig. 5d (III)), jumping (Fig. 5d (IV)), pulse vibrating (Fig. 5d (V)) and elbow bending (Fig. 5d (VI)). These signals contain large strains from body movement, moderate drafting from muscle expansion and contraction, and weak squeezing from pulse pulsations, which varies in intensity and frequency. Nevertheless, all of these show good repeatability, reliability, and reversibility, indicating the fine applicability and stability of prepared TPPCN membrane to the detection of human motion in a full range.

Human body temperature is of great importance to indicate various syndromes (e.g., influenza, metabolism disorders, and inflammation) and current state of the body. It is imperative to maintain a constant body temperature or to detect and alert for abnormal temperature variation. Owing to a great conductivity, TPPCN membrane can be used for electric-thermal conversion, results are shown in Fig. 6. The simultaneous temperature variation is shown in the time curves (Fig. 6b). As we can see, when the electric field is added to the TPPCN membrane, the temperature increases rapidly and reaches an equilibrium temperature subsequently. The heating temperature increases with applied voltage increased from 0.5 to 2.0 V. As long as 60 s is energized at a small voltage of 2 V, the temperature up to 70 °C can be achieved, indicating a high heating efficiency. Figure 6d shows the IR images of the heating process under a voltage of 5 V. Several typical dynamic temperatures of 35, 50, 75, and 100 °C during the heating process are recorded and displayed. Especially, this is an interesting current detection device. We use thermochromic PDMS to do an encapsulation to TPPCN membrane. When the current is turned on, Joule heat will cause obvious color change in PDMS (Fig. 6e), which plays an important warning role. Besides, cycle test of heating/cooling process is performed (Fig. 6c). A suitable circulation temperature of 33–50 °C (within the normal physiological signs) is selected. During each cycle, a voltage of 2 V is used to the TPPCN membrane until the resulting temperature reached ~50 °C. Then, the power supply was turned off until the sample temperature decreased to ~33 °C. The sample remains unaffected for several cycles, demonstrating the thermal stability and cyclability of the prepared TPPCN membrane. For the temperature sensing performance, the temperature and resistance variation of the sample are measured in real-time heating process simultaneously (Fig. 6f). TPPCN membrane shows an obvious thermosensitive property that the resistance decreases with increasing temperature. And the GF value is calculated to be 3.41 and 16.6% °C−1 among the temperature range of 20–85 °C and 85–100 °C, respectively. In another two experiments (Fig. 6g, h), significant response peaks can be observed when hot water and ice water are respectively close to TPPCN membrane with constant temperature (75 °C and 20 °C). To sum up, all these results indicate its potential applications in personal thermal management.

Harvesting energy from environments or human movement is both attractive and technically feasible for wearable electronics. And the cooperativity between soft materials and nanotechnology has yielded infusive advancements in nanogenerators. The assembled nanogenerator exhibits a typical sandwich structure, where CCNTs-doped PDMS and TPPCN membrane act as triboelectric layer and the electrode (Fig. 7a, digital image of prepared TENG are shown inset of Fig. 7e). Interface between CCNTs-doped-PDMS and TPPCN membrane is shown in Fig. S14. Figure 7b schematically exhibits the configuration and detailed working principle of the TENG. The equivalent charges with opposite polarities are formed between PDMS film and Al foil (Fig. 7b (I)). When the Al foil separates from the TPPCN, an electrical potential difference is formed between these two surfaces with oppositely charged owing to the difference in the ability to capture charge. Subsequently, transient electrons flow from the electrode to the ground to generate a current pulse until a new electrostatic equilibrium is achieved. Thus, continuous contact/separation process will produce continuous alternative current. Output voltage is shown in Fig. 7c, d with an increased pressure and frequency. TENG with area of 40 × 40 mm could generate a typical voltage of 78 V. Also, corresponding current output is shown in Fig. 7e, and 0.45 μA is obtained. Furthermore, TENG is linked to LEDs in a rectified circuit (Fig. 7f) as a self-powered system. After repeat pressing process, LEDs are readily lighted, indicating a potential possibility for the applications in the field of indicator lights or energy collection equipment.",,[],"['Wang', 'Graduate School Of Medicine', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Shinshu University', 'Tokida', 'Ueda', 'Nagano', 'Institute For Fiber Engineering', 'Ifes']"
The sustainable fashion brands leading the charge in China,"China is one of the world's largest clothing manufacturers but when it comes to sustainable fashion, which companies are leading the way? (Photo by Johannes Eisele/ AFP via Getty Images)

China’s fashion consumers are observing first-hand the disastrous impact of pollution not only on the environment but also on their health and this is translating into demand for more sustainable fashion choices.

In fact, a Chinese University of Hong Kong report in 2018, concluded air pollution caused an average of 1.1 million premature deaths in the country.

The latest ‘Green Guilt Report: Sustainable Consumption in China’ by Shanghai-based Daxue Consulting (released in April 2022) supports consumer’s growing awareness of sustainable fashion. It reveals 77% of surveyed Chinese consumers (75% of whom are based in major cities), are willing to pay 5%-20% extra for sustainable fashion products, with up to 20% of upper-class Chinese consumers open to paying double for such lines.

The sustainable fashion brands succeeding in China

On the list of prominent Chinese ‘green fashion’ brands are Icicle, which focuses on sustainability and uses natural fabrics made from natural yarns such as cashmere, linen, wool, silk and cotton, with a brand slogan of ‘Made in Earth’. Regarding sourcing, a company note said: “We travel the world in search of outstanding textile producers with irreproachable ethical practices. Whether it is cashmere from Afghanistan and Inner Mongolia, linen from Belgium, wool from Italy, silk from China or organic cotton from Japan, our fabrics all conform to exacting standards. “

Ziran, which uses ‘xian yun sha silk – a sustainable and natural input using ancient, handcrafted methods to create luxury silk, has also developed sales in this growing niche.

Finally, Klee Klee, which translates into “slow down” in spoken Tibetan, uses eco-friendly materials and dyeing techniques, degradable packaging and recycled buttons, and it is another company tapping into the growing sustainability portion of the Chinese market.

The Tibetan name might impede sales outside of China given Western awareness of the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950 and 1951, and the subsequent fleeing of the Dalai Lama in 1959, however these concerns are not a problem in mainland China, where most citizens view Tibet as an integral part of the country.

In a note sent to this publication, Klee Klee explained it uses non-transgenic cotton grown without using chemical fertilisers or pesticides. The entire planting process meets the requirements of the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) and reduces the use of artificial chemicals in the textile process and the pollution of the natural environment. Klee Klee uses vegetable dyes such as indigo and collaborates with factories that specialise in plant dye. It also uses cleaning fabric with ozone and aims to use undyed fabric and yarn where possible. The company also makes buttons from recycled PET bio-plastic bottles that can themselves be 100% recycled.

Klee Klee’s brand manager Zhuang Qing pointed out most of the company’s manufacturers are based in Shanghai with more than half of them are based around Jiangsu, Shanghai and Zhejiang. It also works with ethnic minorities such as the Dulong people in the Yunnan province to develop the fabrics.

Qing added: “The textiles come from a range of different suppliers, some local and some international. For example, we have denim fabrics from Italy and Japan. The cut and sew is done in China. We have high requirements for sustainability, so we select our suppliers based on whether they have more sustainable processing equipment and expertise. For example, one of our suppliers does an O3 wash, which uses the oxidation process to wash away some dye and get the colour we want. For other denim wash factories, we require them to have water processing facilities to make sure the waste water is properly processed.”

Klee Klee also has a long-term partnership with a bio-dynamic silk-making farm that is GOTS-certified and offers fair pay. Klee Klee uses the silk the farm produces to make its products.

The strength of the ‘Made in China’ tag

“The main factor that contributes to these brands’ success is the rejuvenation of the ‘Made in China’ tag, which usually comes with stereotypes of low-quality and was generally perceived negatively in the past,” explained Denise Cheng, an analyst at China market research company, Daxue Consulting.

Referring to China’s “national tide” trend of replacing foreign brands’ dominance with that of local brands in a wide range of products, such as fashion, she said: “Whilst riding the ‘Guochao’ wave, these brands also focus on sustainability and create ethical fashion products with bold and aesthetic designs, ditching the fast fashion mentality.”

Similarly, another market observer, Anaïs Bournonville, head of the luxury division at Shanghai-based consultancy Gentlemen Marketing Agency (GMA), said “green fashion” as a market had strong potential if brands manage to incorporate this factor in a smart and localised way.

“While international brands have trouble engaging with the Chinese consumers on the topic of sustainability, Chinese brands use the artistic and emotional approach to share their values,” Bournonville said.

“By highlighting the importance of family values, dedication to the next generation, and protection of mother nature, brands get a higher level of engagement with their customers,” she added.

On the manufacturing side, Bournonville explained that most Chinese manufacturers appreciate the growing potential of green fashion for both Chinese and Western markets, being strongly conscious of their unique selling point of making sustainable fashion at a competitive price. Bournonville pointed out also that some sustainable materials are also widely available in China, such as recycled PET, which is helping brands to produce sustainable collections with larger volumes and lower costs.

China’s national carbon neutral goal

On the policy side, Fan Di, a professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University’s Institute of Textiles and Clothing, says Chinese fashion and textiles industries have an urgent need to move toward green fashion in part due to China having set the national goal of achieving carbon neutral by 2060. Given the strong role government plays in China, Fan noted public policy has a significant impact on corporate decision making within the country.

“After the goal set by the central government, local governments will develop local plans to reduce carbon emissions, and these plans will inevitably pressure manufacturing sectors to reduce carbon emissions, making companies in these industries encounter more stringent environmental regulations and enforcements,” Fan explained.

Meanwhile, developing sustainable or green fashion is a way for Chinese fashion and textiles industries to add value to their products, compensating for China’s increasing production costs and helping them compete with “rivals in southeast Asia who have a low-cost advantage,” he added.

Fan explained many of the manufacturers that have jumped onto the green fashion bandwagon are companies that initially needed to follow the sustainability requirements requested by overseas customers.

The International Organization for Standardization’s ISO 14001 standard on environmental management system certification for example, has been widely adopted by Chinese fashion and textiles companies. Many firms have also adopted Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards on disclosing sustainability information. “Using these internationally prevailing practices can increase legitimacy of their green practices,” Fan noted.

The fine balance between price and quality for sustainable brands in China

“On the other hand, although sustainability has become an increasingly important factor, product price and quality are still critical to Chinese consumers. This means Chinese fashion brands need to balance the tradeoffs between ‘being green’ and ‘low price’, by trying to avoid transferring too much of the cost of green products to the consumers,” he added.

Dan Wang, the Shanghai-based chief economist of Hang Seng Bank (China), says that on the consumer side, she is not sure if the green fashion trend can trickle down to areas outside of China’s major ‘Tier 1’ cities “because people are indeed still price sensitive” in smaller towns and cities.

On the financing side however, Wang noted that banks are now issuing special loans to companies that are making efforts to lower carbon emissions, given they are likely to pick up business as a result.

“My bank has a client in the fabric industry, who tracks carbon emissions in every step of their clothing production and shows [that information on] their labels,” said Wang: “Government purchases, including through state-owned enterprises, universities and other public sectors, will lead much of the effort by allocating more money to buying those green fashion products for their employees,” she added.

Given such pressure from government, and the shift in consumer awareness, China’s huge market for clothing and textiles is likely to become increasingly focused on sustainability.

The Strange Tale of Herschel Walker and the Chicken Empire That Wasn’t,"A 1996 profile of Walker in Sports Illustrated by the columnist Skip Bayless called his statements “a wacky maze of contradictions” and portrayed Walker as setting himself up to fall short of the “superhuman” expectations he publicly set for himself.

“Beginning during his college days at Georgia,” Bayless wrote, “he turned himself into almost a cartoon superhero: a world-class sprinter who had a black belt, performed in a ballet, made the Olympic bobsled team, chased criminals and even scored touchdowns in his spare time.”

Many aspects of Walker’s biography, however, have collapsed under closer scrutiny. On Monday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Walker has repeatedly claimed he “worked in law enforcement,” when in fact he hasn’t.

Considering Bio-Based Textile Solutions,"Consumer demand and the urgency of the need to shift to more sustainable means of production across all industries have prompted the fashion industry to look for more environmentally friendly textile solutions.

Study: Biobased Innovation as a Fashion and Textile Design Must: A European Perspective. Image Credit: Yulia.Panova/Shutterstock.com

A new paper presented in the journal Sustainability looks at the prevalence of and advances in bio-based textile solutions throughout Europe, aiming to map current practices and showcase best practice examples of bio-based textiles as part of a move to a circular economy.

In order to be practically and commercially viable, bio-based circular materials must exhibit similar textural and mechanical properties to their non-bio-based countered. Scientific advances have already introduced many viable bio-based alternatives into global supply chains, but the use of these materials alone is not considered to be wholly sustainable.

Theoretical framework flowchart. Image Credit: D’Itria, E et al., Sustainability

The authors point out that a fashion product can only be considered to be sustainable if every step of its production process, maintenance, cleaning, and disposal is part of a systemically sustainable approach. It is vital that this issue be solved, as the fashion industry is reported to be one of the most wasteful global consumer industries.

The authors highlight that while natural fibers tend to be considered to be more environmentally friendly choices than their synthetic counterparts, the distinction is not as simple as many assume. They highlight that the key issues lie in fibers’ production rather than its inherent qualities and that each type of fabric has its own pitfalls and challenges.

In order to explore this, the paper looks at this issue from the perspective of fashion designers themselves and the impact they can have on sustainable fashion practices, and on the use of bio-based textiles and biomaterials.

The paper presents a model for what it terms “fashion design-driven biobased innovations”. The authors envision an innovative circular system that leverages productive textile processes to transform the wider fashion industry.

They expand on this model via a series of literature reviews, theoretical frameworks, and the mapping of existing practices from 86 established European fashion and textiles companies in relation to their sustainability efforts.

This information is supplemented with interviews, whereby the authors spoke to 15 experts on fashion from both industry and academic backgrounds.

Once it had been collated, the data was processed in line with the Textile Exchange Benchmarking Report 2021. This approach allowed the authors to better measure the factors impacting new material innovations and ensure that the research maintained a suitably industry-led perspective.

Most notably, the report looks at three areas of interest that were deemed to be in line with the study: current industry strategies, measuring progress and impact, and shifting consumption from virgin resources to reclaimed and recycled materials.

The design-driven biobased innovation model. Image Credit: D’Itria, E et al., Sustainability

From this work, three overarching themes were identified in terms of the companies’ practices: innovative design and the development of new practices for working with biomaterials, biofabrication, and the tendency of companies to focus their efforts on the use of biomaterials in more traditional ways, and emotional design – a novel concept whereby companies look to shift the consumption of fashion to more long-lasting, sustainable products by working to affect consumer purchasing habits. Each of these concepts is illustrated with a practical case study.

The paper highlights how companies working with bio-based materials are facing a number of challenges in the field. Many of these challenges stem from the fact that biomaterials often undergo additional processing or blending with other materials as part of their production, potentially impacting the materials’ capacity to be considered truly circular in nature. These additional material components can also impact a bio-based material’s recyclability, limiting its potential to be returned to the production system at the end of its working life.

It is also noted that many material innovations are hindered by extended research and development times, and the challenges surrounding obtaining sufficient funding to pursue new avenues of research.

It is difficult to progress material experiments from prototypes to commercialized high volume production, often requiring a specific nexus of cultural, economic, and technological factors to enable this.

The design-driven biobased system conceptual model—sustainable design strategies combinations. Image Credit: D’Itria, E et al., Sustainability

The paper summarizes these challenges, particularly surrounding the importance of maintaining traceability, transparency, and accountability as part of the circular fashion industry.

It will be difficult for the fashion industry to meet these challenges, but the authors note that the industry typically thrives during periods of rapid change as it routinely transforms its output and production methods to accommodate changing trends in consumer demand.

As consumer demand continues to grow for more sustainable products, the authors anticipate that new ideas and technological advances will continue to move the fashion industry towards a sustainable and circular paradigm.

"The global green and bio polyols market size is estimated at USD 4.4 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach USD 6.9 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 9.5%, between 2022 and 2027","ReportLinker

The growth of the global green and bio polyols market is directly related to the strict government regulation against excessive use of petroleum-based polyols. The increasing production of PU flexible or rigid foams, as insulating material in infrastructure & building, in the furniture & bedding industry, and in packaging is expected to propel the growth of the green and bio polyols market globally.

New York, May 25, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Green and Bio Polyols Market by Raw Material, Type, Application End-use Industry and Region - Global Forecast to 2027"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p05084766/?utm_source=GNW





The use of green and bio-based polyols in CASE applications is also a major growth factor for the market.



The global green and bio polyols market size is estimated at USD 4.4 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach USD 6.9 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 9.5%, between 2022 and 2027. Growth in the green and bio polyols market can primarily be attributed to the growing involvement of green and bio polyols in the industries such as construction, transportation and automotive, furniture & bedding among others.



Green and bio polyols are either synthesized from natural oils, such as soya, castor, palm, canola, and sunflower, or natural sources, such as corn and sugar, or Carbon Dioxide (CO2).They are also recycled from polymers, such as polyurethanes (PU) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET).



These polyols are used to make PU rigid and flexible foams, and coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers (CASE), which are used in several end-use industries.The green and bio polyols market comprises polyether polyols and polyester polyols.



Green and bio-based polyether polyols are obtained by polycondensation reaction of propane-1,3-diol derived from glycerin, which can be obtained from several plant sources. Bio-based polyester polyols are formed by the condensation of bio-based dicarboxylic acids, such as adipic or succinic acid, with bio-based polyols (propane-1, 3-diol).



Natural oils and their derivatives is the largest raw material segment of the green and bio polyols market

Based on raw materials, the green and bio polyols market includes natural oils and their derivatives, sucrose, glycerin, and carbon dioxide.The natural oils and their derivatives raw material segment led the application segment of the market in terms of both value and volume.



Bio-polyols made from natural oils are also known as natural oil polyols.These polyols can be made from soybean oil, rapeseed (canola) oil, palm oil, castor oil, and sunflower oil.



The usage of a specific natural oil can be dependent on the region.All the natural oil polyols have similar sources and applications, but the materials are quite different, depending on how they are made.



These polyols are colorless to light yellow. The viscosity of these polyols can vary based on the raw materials; it is determined by their molecular weight and the average number of hydroxyl groups present per molecule. The odor of these polyols varies based on the oil from which they are derived. Most natural oil polyols are quite similar chemically to their parent vegetable oils and are prone to rancidity.



Polyether polyols is the largest applications segment of the green and bio polyols market

Based on type, the green and bio polyols market is divided into polyether polyols and polyester polyols.The polyether polyols type segment accounted for the largest share in the green and bio polyols market in 2021.



Polyether polyols are generally produced by the catalysis reaction of epoxides.They are mainly used in the manufacturing of PU flexible foam.



Polyether polyols contain multiple ether linkages and hydroxyl groups in their molecular form.Most of these polyols are used for manufacturing urethanes, surface-active agents, functional fluids, and synthetic lubricants.



The physical properties of polyether polyols depend on the length of the polymer chain. These polyols have a molecular weight of more than 3,000.



PU flexible foams in the largest applications segment of the green and bio polyols market

Based on applications, the green and bio polyols market is divided into PU Flexible Foam, CASE, and PU Rigid Foam.The PU flexible foams application segment accounted for the largest share in the green and bio polyols market in 2021.



PU flexible foams are used in different consumer and commercial products, including furniture, carpet cushion, transportation, bedding, packaging, textiles, and fibers.These foams consist of slab stock, which is primarily used for carpet cushions and furniture.



They are also used for office chairs, stadium seating, and auditorium seating.As a cushioning material, these foams provide support, comfort, durability, and energy absorption.



PU flexible foams have a wide range of applications in the automotive industry, such as in seating, headrests, arms rests; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) components, interior panels & skins, car & truck fenders, headliners, and other interior systems. The use of polyurethane for automotive design results in weight reduction, passenger comfort, and compressive strength in vehicles, thus driving the need for polyurethane flexible foams in the automotive industry.



Furniture & bedding is the largest end-use industry segment of the green and bio polyols market

Based on the end-use industry, the green and bio polyols market is divided into furniture & bedding, construction, automotive, packaging, carpet backing, others.The furniture & bedding end-use industry segment is the largest end-user of green and bio polyols.



Increased construction activities in the housing sector, especially in emerging economies, have fueled the demand for furniture & bedding products.Growing income levels in the emerging markets have led to added expenditure on luxury commodities.



The furniture & bedding industry is a rapidly growing market for green and bio polyols, which are being increasingly used to manufacture cushions for sofas, recliners, and upholstered chairs for both household and commercial purposes.



North America is the largest market for green and bio polyols market



The North America region is projected to be the largest market, in terms of value.North America is expected to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period.

North America is a leader in the polyurethane market in terms of demand and product innovation in improving performance and quality.New developments in applications, such as aerospace, automotive, and wind energy, also make North America a dominating market.



The automotive, furniture, consumer durables, and food & beverage industries are the major consumers of these polyols in the region.

Polestar hosts ‘Future Talk’ on sustainable material design at Amsterdam museum,"Aren van Muijen is a trainer, writer and freelance journalist, writing mainly about environmental issues. In 2009 he founded De Zonnefabriek (show all) Aren van Muijen is a trainer, writer and freelance journalist, writing mainly about environmental issues. In 2009 he founded De Zonnefabriek, the first solarpanel company in Holland.

Fighting climate change. That’s about solar panels, ditching meat, flying less, and driving an electric car, right? Absolutely, but that’s only half the story.

For a lot of product designers, sustainability is becoming the key focus of their creative process. They’re on a mission to find new ways to replace some of the most common (and most carbon intensive) materials and components with new, green alternatives. And that’s good news for the planet, because radical breakthroughs in zero-waste, bio-based, and energy neutral — or positive — products are needed more and more.

The good news: breakthroughs are already being made everyday! Last week, I visited the first ‘Future Talks’ meeting, organized by electric car manufacturer Polestar with their long-term partner Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. ‘Future Talks’ is a series of meetings in which a wide range of experts, along with the public, debate about the biggest challenges facing the future of sustainability.

Hi there, EV nerd! Subscribe now for a weekly recap of our favorite mobility stories

Future Talks: Sustainable Materials

This first meeting was all about product design and alternative materials. In a panel discussion, hosted by former Dutch Channel 1 news anchor Sacha de Boer, architects, artists, professors, entrepreneurs, and consultants debated the question of how we can restore our connection with nature and the role of sustainable design and eco-positive materials in this process.

As designer Hakim El Amrani from Studio NousNous puts it:

If ‘nature’ is not around us, then we lose connection and no longer value nature as a ‘must’ anymore.

El Amrani’s work is all about ‘Biophilic design’, a concept used within the construction industry to increase connectivity to the natural environment. He uses it both when designing individual buildings, as well as on the city-scale.

The most obvious example of this is having plants in your home. But, more often, ‘nature’ is also found in custom-designed furniture based on eco-friendly materials. It’s argued that this approach has all kinds of health, environmental, and economic benefits for residents.

“Interaction with nature is key,” says El Amrani.

Knowing who we are as human beings, knowing what our position is related to our surroundings, it all starts with knowledge, love and respect for nature. On top of that, we believe that with Biophilic design, we can encourage more sustainable behaviors amongst our customers in the long run.

Other sessions included a talk on how we can leverage raw materials in sustainable design and how we can move towards completely carbon neutral design.

While most of the speakers were working in the design industry, one speaker, Bart Nollen, working for impact assessment tool dayrize, brought up the importance of data in the process. Without data and continuous measurement, we won’t be able to both see progress on sustainability and hold businesses accountable for it.

While design and data aren’t usually associated with each other, a key feature of the future of sustainable design will likely be the inclusion of data.

Our F***ing Backyard

The collaboration with ‘Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam’ is obvious. Accompanied with Future Talks, the museum is currently hosting an exposition about sustainable design and materials called It’s Our F***cking Backyard. Designing Material Futures.

The exhibition showcases impressive ideas and solutions for producing materials with less impact, or better yet, producing them with an eco-positive footprint. Take, for example, the work of artist Eric Klarenbeek, who makes glass out of micro-algae. The algae take CO2 out of the water (and the water adsorbs it from the air). With this CO2, the algae can create a ‘plate armor’ of glass. Klarenbeek harvests the algae, dries it, and turns it into strong, solid glass.

“When grown and used on a large scale, we can truly take a big step in ‘climate positive’ construction,” Klarenbeek says.

The entire exhibition is full of products made out of recycled waste or new nature-based products. Ceramic waste in furniture, textiles made out of pine needles, tableware made of cow’s blood (!), but also the reintroduction of an ancient painting technique for dyeing clothing.

What all the products, ideas, and manufacturing processes have in common is that they challenge the way we build and produce materials today. Their aim is to show us how out-of-the box thinking can help us develop desperately needed alternatives for today’s consumption driven and non-sustainable society.

2030 is the year

And Polestar? What does this new kid on the EV block have to do with this? Well, maybe everything.

Polestar is aiming to build a climate neutral car by 2030 with a carbon footprint of 0 throughout its lifetime. This is a major task as we realize that electrification is perhaps the easiest part of the process. At the start of the so-called ‘Polestar 0 project’ Fredrika Klarén, head of Polestar’s sustainability division, explained:

We are an electric car manufacturer, so consequently we don’t have to worry about emission spewing combustion engines. But that doesn’t mean the job is done. The real challenge is to ban all the emissions within the whole production process, from the materials we use up to circular batteries and everything in between.

Simply compensating the CO2 emissions by planting trees is not enough for Polestar. Experts warn that planting trees for CO2 compensation, in the long run, isn’t that sustainable after all. Forests can be chopped or burned down, which blows the stored carbon back into the atmosphere, neutralizing the positive impact it once made.

“How are we going to do it?” asked managing director of Polestar Netherlands, Willem Baudewijns, on stage at Future Talks.

Lots of questions aren’t answered yet, lots of problems still need to be solved. Producing and recycling a battery comes with an average of 9 tons of CO2 equivalent. To be honest, we don’t know yet how to lower this number, but by setting the bar high, we force ourselves to ultimately design towards zero.

Designing towards positive impact

At that moment somebody from the audience took the floor… “Designing towards a positive impact, that’s the goal you should chase,” she said.

Fighting climate change, unchaining a revolution, it all starts with a positive narrative. Designing towards zero displays a message of stagnation, whereas the narrative can and should be: we must change things for the better. It may sound marginal, but in my opinion it makes a big difference.

I understood the point the speaker wanted to make, but somehow I feared that such an approach was a bit too far out of the comfort zone of the other participants. To my surprise, all of the speakers on stage fully agreed with this alternative narrative. Big changes still start with a good story, I thought. And designing towards a positive impact may be the subject for future talks on sustainability.",,[],"['Aren Van Muijen', 'Story By']"
Asahi Kasei AKXY2 Concept Debuts As A Futuristic And Sustainable Living Room On Wheels,"Japan’s Asahi Kasei is celebrating their centennial by unveiling the AKXY2 concept.



Designed to reimagine “how values for sustainability, satisfaction and society will influence the needs of future mobility on the road to automation and electrification,” the concept is a futuristic pod that shares some visual similarities to the Wienermobile of all things.

Putting that aside, the concept features a ‘split’ body with a streamlined lower section and an upper glass canopy. The latter rises vertically, while a door folds down to provide access to the cabin.

The company didn’t say much about the exterior, but it features slender lighting units and aerodynamic wheel covers with what appears to be transparent inserts. The model also rides on S-SBR tires, which are made from a bio-based butadiene and have a low rolling resistance.

The futuristic design continues in the cabin as there’s an ottoman as well as two individual seats with Cubit cushioning, which features a “3D mesh material made of PET and partially bio-based PTT.” Elsewhere, there’s Dinamica microfiber upholstery, a small wooden table, and a minimalist information display. Since the model lacks a steering wheel and pedals, it’s probably safe to assume the concept is envisioned to be fully autonomous.

The technology features extend beyond the driving system as the concept has been equipped with the company’s Healthy Car Portfolio of products. Among the features are antimicrobial fabrics and a CO2 sensor that works to ensure “optimal air quality.”

Rounding out the highlights are sustainable textiles as well as semi-transparent and backlit fabrics. They’re joined by an optical fiber ambient lighting system.

According to Asahi Kasei America’s Director of North American Mobility, Mike Franchy, the “AKXY2 showcases our expertise as a trusted partner to OEMs and Tier-1s for both interior and exterior components and technology.” He added the company has come a long way in the past 100 years and he’s “looking forward to seeing these contributions continue to shape the automotive industry.”

The concept will be shown at a number of upcoming events including the North American International Auto Show in September and CES in January.",,[],[]
"Unfaithful, too striking... why William Morris’s wife was painted out of the Arts and Crafts movement","Revered for his textiles, his art and his socialism, William Morris is the celebrated leader of the Arts and Crafts movement, a renowned intellectual who revolutionised decorative art and design in Britain. His wife, Jane, meanwhile, has been relegated to the status of a silent muse.

Now, the first joint biography of the couple will shine a light on their personal and creative partnership, and reassert the rightful place of Jane Morris – a skilled embroiderer and talented designer – in the history books.

“Jane’s work has been undervalued and generally ignored,” said Suzanne Fagence Cooper, author of the forthcoming biography, How We Might Live. “She is seen as just a face and not as a maker with her own ideas.”

Immortalised for ever in the pre-Raphaelite paintings of her obsessive lover Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Jane Morris was essential to the creation and success of her husband’s decorative arts firm, Morris & Co, in 1861, the book will explain.

“They needed her soft skills and her embroidery skills, and her willingness to be the pre-Raphaelite face of the Morris company brand,” Fagence Cooper said.

Jane’s artistic contributions have been ignored, Cooper thinks, in part because she was such a famous beauty, who was notoriously unfaithful to her husband with his friend Rossetti and others. “I think there’s been some prurience around that. It has made her a more complicated figure,” she said.

As the working-class daughter of an ostler and a laundress, Jane had no formal education and has been viewed as undeserving – and unequal to – her wealthy, middle-class genius of a husband: “People want to put William Morris on a pedestal,” said Dr Johanna Amos, of Queen’s University in Ontario. “There’s this view of Jane as someone who betrayed this lion of the British art scene in the 19th century. And I think that damaged her reputation.”

But without Jane’s housekeeping and networking skills, Morris & Co might not have been formed, said Fagence Cooper: “It was set up, basically, around her dining table at Red House in Kent.”

One of the first decorations that William Morris made was a daisy-patterned wall hanging for Red House, which has since cemented his reputation as a design pioneer. “Jane later tells her daughter May, in a letter, that she chose the fabrics for that. And she and Morris sat down together, worked out what pattern was possible and then they stitched it together,” said Cooper.

The couple invited their artist friends, who included Edward Burne-Jones and Rossetti, to help them finish the decoration of Red House – and when the first discussions about Morris & Co took place between the men, it is likely that Jane was present, and involved, Fagence Cooper thinks. “They were designing for Red House, and the first designs happened there. But then they decided to make it bigger and to start to sell those designs,” she said.

In particular, she thinks that Jane would have put forward ideas about the embroidery they could sell. “She was involved in getting the materials, and choosing the right fabric, embroidery threads and silks. She’s absolutely essential to the making of the products, as well as the gathering of people to begin the process of founding Morris & Co.”

For more than 20 years, she then ran the embroidery side of the business which, Fagence Cooper said, became “very significant”.

“She would be stitching, and overseeing stitching for all the women, as they turned the men’s designs into beautiful hangings and decorations,” she added.

Amos said: “She probably made choices around colour, around the selection of stitches, around how the work took shape.” But her skill in being able to make those decisions and to interpret her husband’s ideas has not, traditionally, been recognised as creative “design” work.

Because all Jane’s labour was unpaid and, unlike her male co-founders, she had no money to invest in the company, her name doesn’t appear in the company accounts. It was only in 2012, when Jane’s letters were discovered and published, that her “invisible” work on Morris & Co designs became known to academics, Fagence Cooper said.

The biography, which is published on on 9 June, will also demonstrate that Jane was involved in Rossetti’s artistic process when she sat for The Blue Silk Dress, his painting of her, in 1868.

Jane herself made the dress in which she sat, said Fagence Cooper, “and there was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing in the letters between her and Rossetti about what it should look like, how it should feel. And Rossetti really bows to her expertise.”

But it is only in the little “keepsake books” she made for friends that Jane has the opportunity to display her own “really distinctive” designs, said Fagence Cooper. “They’re very geometric and rely a lot on red and black contrasts, and all the backgrounds are shaded with little lines, which are almost like embroidery stitches.

“They look much more like Vanessa Bell’s work – they have an early Bloomsbury feel. It’s very different from what William Morris was making.”",,[],[]
"Plastics, microplastics, bioplastics, and waste management - the deep reaching implications of the Circular Economy Action Plan","Disruption is on the horizon for the plastics value chain, with experts predicting that the EU’s new Circular Economy Action Plan could direct actions and business plans for the next decade. Following on from his previous article on this topic, Paul Foulkes-Arellano, founder of Circuthon Consulting, takes a closer look at the proposals and what they might mean for our industry.

In my previous article examining the broad implications of the European Commission Circular Economy Action Plan, I was unable to delve into the detail regarding plastics, microplastics, bioplastics, and waste management. I felt these deserved much deeper analysis, as they herald equally radical change and imply far-reaching challenges for the packaging industry.

Let’s begin with the blockbuster, which will really set heads spinning.

For many years, commentators have said that a reduction in the number of polymers used for packaging would simplify sorting and processing. I don’t truly believe that anyone in their wildest dreams thought this would ever be mandated. However, this idea is buried deep in the CEAP 2.0. It’s the third bullet point of clause 3.3 which relates to packaging.

“The Commission will … consider other measures, with a focus on:

considering reducing the complexity of packaging materials, including the number of materials and polymers used.”

It’s in writing, it’s definitely referring to polymers, but to unspecified “materials” as well. We can only conjecture at what those other materials might be. At a time when billions of euros are being spent on new material development, we are facing perhaps (or certainly) legislation which limits polymer innovation, much of which is based on biobased feedstocks – as encouraged by other guidance issued by the very commission which is now looking to restrict additional packaging polymers.

Clause 3.4 of the plan focuses specifically on plastics, for all manufacture, but clearly with packaging in mind. This is how the clause begins:

“As consumption of plastics is expected to double in the coming 20 years, the Commission will take further targeted measures to address the sustainability challenges posed by this ubiquitous material and will continue to promote a concerted approach to tackle plastics pollution at global. To increase the uptake of recycled plastics and contribute to the more sustainable use of plastics, the Commission will propose mandatory requirements for recycled content and waste reduction measures for key products such as packaging, construction materials and vehicles, also taking into account the activities of the Circular Plastics Alliance.”

Here we begin to see some of the contradictions in the CEAP. If the CEAP is successful, by 2040, we will have seen a huge increase in packaging-free, reuse and refill. French and German lawmakers plan to mandate 20% of non-linear formats by 2030. Guidance from The Institute of Grocery Distribution in the UK points towards a 20-30% reduction in absolute units of packaging (if all recycling initiatives are optimal) by 2030. So surely it’s somewhat illogical to suggest a 100% increase in plastics over the next 20 years.

But let’s put that to one side and look at the other topics covered by CEAP. Microplastics and bioplastics.

Microplastics

There is a clear acknowledgement that in Europe packaging is not the principal source of microplastics. Yet imagery from European institutions around the subject seems to always feature packaging… Nonetheless, the topic of microplastics is a clear focus:

“In addition to measures to reduce plastic litter, the Commission will address the presence of microplastics in the environment by:

restricting intentionally added microplastics and tackling pellets taking into account the opinion of the European Chemicals Agency; developing labelling, standardisation, certification and regulatory measures on the unintentional release of microplastics, including measures to increase the capture of microplastics at all relevant stages of products’ lifecycle; further developing and harmonising methods for measuring unintentionally released microplastics, especially from tyres and textiles, and delivering harmonised data on microplastics concentrations in seawater; (my italics) closing the gaps on scientific knowledge related to the risk and occurrence of microplastics in the environment, drinking water and foods.”

Although not directly related to the packaging industry, there are many politicians who lay the blame for ubiquitous microplastics firmly at the door of our industry, despite the highest levels of capture and reprocessing of polymers of any industry. The textile industry where polyester makes up 66% of all clothing, has reprocessing rates of less than 1% for non-cellulosics. The packaging industry needs to take a stand and educate on this.

Bioplastics

Here the EC is looking for “best in class” bioplastics. There is no requirement on pulp, metal or polymer packaging. Just bioplastics. The phrasing and intent of this appears to be based on where the European bioplastics industry was a decade ago, not in 2025 and beyond. And how are these assessments going to be made? – I find these clauses very problematic.

“Furthermore, the Commission will address emerging sustainability challenges by developing a policy framework on:

sourcing, labelling and use of bio-based plastics, based on assessing where the use of bio-based feedstock results in genuine environmental benefits, going beyond reduction in using fossil resources; use of biodegradable or compostable plastics, based on an assessment of the applications where such use can be beneficial to the environment, and of the criteria for such applications. It will aim to ensure that labelling a product as ‘biodegradable’ or ‘compostable’ does not mislead consumers to dispose of it in a way that causes plastic littering or pollution due to unsuitable environmental conditions or insufficient time for degradation.”

The end of waste exports?

Clause 4.3 is another huge plot twist. The legislation speaks for itself, so here it is unedited:

“In the past decade, millions of tonnes of European waste has been exported to non-EU countries, often without sufficient consideration of proper waste treatment. In many cases, waste exports result both in negative environmental and health impacts in the countries of destination, and in loss of resources and economic opportunities for the recycling industry in the EU. Recent import restrictions introduced by some third countries have exposed the overdependence of the EU on foreign waste treatment, but they have also mobilised the recycling industry to increase its capacity and add value to waste in the EU.

“In the light of these developments, and considering that illegal shipments of waste remain a source of concern, the Commission will take action with the aim to ensure that the EU does not export its waste challenges to third countries. Actions on product design, quality and safety of secondary materials and enhancing their markets will contribute to making “recycled in the EU” a benchmark for qualitative secondary materials.

“Facilitating preparing for re-use and recycling of waste in the EU will be enhanced by a thorough review of EU rules on waste shipments. The review will also aim at restricting exports of waste that have harmful environmental and health impacts in third countries or can be treated domestically within the EU by focusing on countries of destination, problematic waste streams, types of waste operations that are a source of concern, and enforcement to counteract illegal shipments.”

We can see that one of the proposed mechanisms to achieve a “cleaner and more competitive Europe” is to promote the endorsement of “recycled in the EU”. In terms of pure carbon accounting, this has to be less carbon-intense than shipping waste halfway around the world to a coal-powered facility, but who is going to fund the infrastructure?

This Circular Economy Action Plan is not just aimed at Europe and European businesses.

Clause 7 sets out the global ambitions of the EU, and the role the European Commission wishes to play across the globe. This is not merely about moving the needle on this continent, it’s about showing the world how Europe wants things done. If you sell in Europe, you must comply. Added to this, the EC would expect the fundamentals of the CEAP to be adopted by other governments around the world, as previous legislation has been adopted/adapted.

“To support a global shift to a circular economy, the Commission will:

building on the European Plastics Strategy, lead efforts at international level to reach a global agreement on plastics, and promote the uptake of the EU’s circular economy approach on plastics; propose a Global Circular Economy Alliance to identify knowledge and governance gaps in advancing a global circular economy and take forward partnership initiatives, including with major economies; explore the feasibility of defining a ‘Safe Operating Space’ for natural resource use and consider initiating discussions on an international agreement on the management of natural resources; build a stronger partnership with Africa to maximise the benefits of the green transition and the circular economy; ensure that Free Trade Agreements reflect the enhanced objectives of the circular economy; continue promoting the circular economy in the accession process with the Western Balkans, and in the context of bilateral, regional and multilateral policy dialogues, fora and environmental agreements, as well as of pre-accession assistance and neighbourhood, development and international cooperation programmes, including the International Platform on Sustainable Finance; step up outreach activities, including through the European Green Deal diplomacy and the Circular Economy missions, and work with EU Member States to enhance coordination and joint efforts for a global circular economy.”

There is a stark and honest conclusion to the Circular Economy Action Plan, which should make us all pause and consider. It will direct all our actions and business plans for the next decade:

“The transition to the circular economy will be systemic, deep and transformative, in the EU and beyond. It will be disruptive at times, so it has to be fair. It will require an alignment and cooperation of all stakeholders at all levels - EU, national, regional and local, and international.”

Disruption, deep systemic transformation, agreement, co-operation. Can we in the packaging industry rise to the challenge? It seems there is no other option.

The Biennial Stars: Meet the 23 (Perhaps Unexpected) Artists Who Have Defined Our Current Era of International Art Shows,"This is part of the Biennial Artist Project, a series on the stars of the biennial circuit. You can also read our critic’s take on the list and a report on the economics of being a biennial star. The full list of biennial artists (and which galleries represent them) is available to Artnet News Pro members.

If you could somehow see every biennial or triennial in the last five years, what patterns would emerge? Which stars would shine brightest?

For this project, we analyzed the artist lists for 211 recurring international art events that have happened or been announced in the five years since the opening of Documenta 14 in April 2017. This is a somewhat arbitrary time period (the 2017 Venice Biennale is not included, since it opened in February 2017, while the 2017 Skulptur Projekte Münster is, since it opened in June of that same year). However, with Documenta 15 about to open, it gives a convenient window to look at the figures who have defined the zeitgeist of this particular half decade in art.

The resulting list looks at figures in big events like the Venice Biennale and the São Paulo Biennial. But it also takes into account many new biennials that sprung up in this period (and that may or may not carry on), as well as hard-to-classify events like Bienalsur, which is technically based in Argentina but seeks to create a simultaneous art conversation about the Global South in far-flung venues, from Houston to Riyadh.

Chronologically, the final artist list included in our tally comes from the upcoming 2023 Sharjah Biennale, which was announced years ago; delayed by the pandemic, it is the final show organized by the late Okwui Enwezor. For the sake of providing some kind of limit to the selection, we didn’t include architecture, design, or photo biennials, focusing on shows dedicated to art (admittedly a somewhat arbitrary disciplinary distinction).

While we are bound to have left out some events, the overall pattern is striking enough that it is not likely to change considerably. Overall, 1,599 artists emerged who had appeared in more than one of these big survey shows in this time period (the full list is available to Artnet News Pro subscribers); 591 appeared in three or more; 260 in four or more; and so on. The list, in other words, follows the classic superstar distribution, with attention becoming more concentrated the higher you go, and narrowing to focus on an elite with many times the exposure of the rest.

Below are this era’s 23 biggest biennial stars, comprising all the artists we found who appeared in eight or more biennials in the past five years.

Korakrit Arunanondchai

Born: 1986

Based in: Bangkok and Brooklyn

Appeared in: Athens Biennale 2018; Baltic Triennial 2018; Biennale de l’Image en Mouvement 2018; October Salon/Belgrade Biennale 2018; Asian Art Biennial (Taiwan) 2019; Venice Biennale 2019; Whitney Biennial 2019; Istanbul Biennial 2019; Performa 2019; Singapore Biennale 2019; Yokohama Triennale 2020; Biennale Gherdëina 2020; Gwangju Biennale 2021; Kathmandu Triennale 2022

Notable Works: No History in a Room Filled With Funny Names 5 (2018)

Arunanondchai is a globe-trotting contemporary-art polymath, working between painting, installation, film, and performance. Since graduating from Columbia’s MFA program in 2012, Arunanondchai has become best known for immersive video installations like No History in a Room Filled With Funny Names 5, shown at the Biennale de l’Image en Mouvement in 2018 and then in Venice in 2019, weaving together personal narrative, current events, Thai folklore, queer club aesthetics, and more.

“In Western white spaces, the work often sits in a neutral ground where ‘a life lived’ doesn’t really enter—it’s like life contaminates the space of art,” he told the White Review last year, explaining his method. “And when life is allowed to enter, it suddenly dominates…how the work can be read. I wanted to find a type of storytelling where all my interests could come together, without these limitations.”

Like many artists on this list, Arunanondchai is also a quintessential collaborator, creating works alongside a recurring cast of colleagues including performer boychild and director and installation designer Alex Gvojic. Ubiquitous on the global biennial scene in the past five years, Arunanondchai has also organized his very own biennial-type event: the Ghost Festival, which brought a cohort of other biennial stars to Thailand in 2018, including Ian Cheng and Samson Young.

Uriel Orlow

Born: 1973

Based in: London and Lisbon

Appeared in: Manifesta 2018; Moscow Biennale 2018; Yinchuan Biennale 2018; Taipei Biennial 2020; Coventry Biennial 2019; Lubumbashi Biennale 2019; Bienal de Arte Paiz 2021; Momentum Biennial 2021; Thailand Biennale 2021; Vienna Biennale for Change 2021; Berlin Biennale 2022; British Art Show 2022; Kathmandu Triennale 2022; Mardin Biennial 2022

Notable Works: Wishing Trees (2018), Learning from Artemisia (2019)

The Switzerland-born Orlow is known for honing in on specific locations and micro-histories, often using botanical knowledge to explore the notion of plants as political actors, and elsewhere the legacies of colonialism, spatial manifestations of memory, and blind spots of representation.

Spanning film, drawing, photography, and sound, his work is particularly well-suited to the biennial format because it speaks to both the local context and universal themes. It stresses long-term collaboration and often involves relationships that persist “beyond the time-frame of the biennial,” gallerist Arthur Gruson told Artnet News. “Orlow’s anchoring of his projects in a particular place whilst addressing translocal issues and his commitment to finding meaningful image regimes and modes of representation result in artistic contributions that have a socio-political grounding and are valued by local as well as international audiences.”

Lawrence Abu Hamdan

Born: 1985

Based in: Dubai

Appeared in: Asian Art Biennial (Taiwan) 2017; Biennale de l’Image en Mouvement 2018; Art Encounters Biennial (Romania) 2019; Bienalsur 2019; Coventry Biennial 2019; Ljubljana Biennial of Graphic Arts 2019; Sharjah Biennial 2019; Venice Biennale 2019; Sydney Biennale 2020; Havana Biennial 2021; São Paulo Biennial 2021; Berlin Biennale 2022; Toronto Biennial 2022

Notable Works: Walled Unwalled (2018); After SFX (2018)

Lawrence Abu Hamdan famously styles himself a private ear (as opposed to a “private eye”). His artwork and research often involve careful investigations of sounds and voices as witnesses of violence and injustice. He works in video, audio documentaries, installations, and workshops to examine the thresholds of sound and voice, often leaning on sound as a vehicle for truth in the absence of visual information.

Recent subjects include the trial of Oscar Pistorius and the recollections of survivors of Saydnaya prison who were kept in darkness at all times. In 2019, Abu Hamdan jointly won the Turner Prize for his exhibition “Earwitness Theatre” and for his performance After SFX, which was also seen at the 2021 São Paulo Biennial.

Superflex

1993

Based in: Copenhagen

Appeared in: ARoS Triennial 2017; Gwangju Biennale 2018; Qalandiya International 2018; Desert X 2019; Thessaloniki Biennale 2019; Vienna Biennale for Change 2019; Desert X AlUla 2020; Thailand Biennale 2021; Vienna Biennale for Change 2021; North Atlantic Triennial 2022; Riga Biennial 2022

Notable Works: Deep Sea Minding (2018–21); The Mammoth Rehearsal Sessions (2021)

The Danish art group Superflex has spent more than a quarter century creating their hard-to-categorize, sometimes humorous, always socially engaged art. The collective—whose founding members are Bjornstjerne Christiansen, Jakob Fenger and Rasmus Nielsen—works collaboratively, both among themselves (no one member ever gets credit for an idea) and with bureaucratic institutions and larger research institutions of various kinds. “We like to engage with systems by going inside to challenge them,” Christiansen told the New York Times. “When you’re inside, you can stir things up much more.”

Multiple works created between 2017 and 2022 spun off from their larger, three-year initiative Deep Sea Minding, an ambitious melding of science, art, and environmentalism that involved a series of voyages aimed at researching the possibilities of new types of marine habitats that respond to a warming world. Their climate-change drive-in movie installation, Dive-In, at the 2019 Desert X Biennial was made of the coral-pink material they have created for this purpose, in anticipation of a possible future desert flooded by rising seas. For The Mammoth Rehearsal Sessions at the Thailand Biennale in 2021, they set up a group hypnosis session where art lovers were prompted to imagine themselves as wooly mammoths being driven to extinction.

Chiharu Shiota

Born: 1972

Based in: Berlin

Appeared in: Jakarta Biennale 2017; Oku-Noto Triennale 2017; OpenArt (Sweden) 2017; Socle du Monde Biennale 2017; October Salon/Belgrade Biennale 2018; Shenzhen Biennale 2018; Honolulu Biennial 2019; Manifesta 2022; Setouchi Triennale 2019; Bangkok Biennale 2022; Oku-Noto Triennale 2020

Notable Works: Becoming Painting (1994); The Key in the Hand (2015)

The Japanese-born artist is best known for creating immersive installations with interwoven skeins of thread. Her massive nets hold small personal objects like keys and spring from desks, boats, or bed frames. Born in 1972 in Osaka, Shiota studied painting at Kyoto Seika University before moving to Berlin to train with Marina Abramovic.

Her artistic breakthrough came in 1994, when she staged Becoming Painting, a performance in which she poured toxic red enamel paint over her body, burning her skin in the process. The work marked her break with painting and the beginning of her quest to place both the artist and the viewer inside her own creations. Perhaps her most famous installation, The Key in the Hand, was her contribution to the Japanese Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2015. She transformed the exhibition space into a web of red yarn; at the end of each thread was a key.

Naeem Mohaiemen

Born: 1969

Based in: New York

Appeared in: Bucharest Biennale 2018; Front Triennial 2018; Industrial Art Biennial (Croatia) 2018; Lahore Biennial 2018; Liverpool Biennial 2018; Art Encounters Biennial (Romania) 2019; Yokohama Triennale 2020; Kyiv Biennial 2021; OFF Biennale (Hungary) 2021; Front Triennial 2022

Notable Works: United Red Army (2011); Tripoli Cancelled (2017); Two Meetings and a Funeral (2017)

Now teaching at Columbia University, Mohaimen participated in the Visible Collective in the 2000s, an important group that agitated around the persecution of Arabs and Muslims at the height of the U.S. War on Terror. In the 2010s, he became celebrated for ambitious, expansive film installations like Two Meetings and a Funeral, premiered at Documenta in 2017, which concentrates on the Non-Aligned Movement of countries that tried to escape the bipolar order of the Cold War as the seed of a potential alternate political history, featuring Marxist historian Vijay Prashad.

“I say what I do is a critique imbricated with love for this movement,” he told Bidoun when he was nominated for the Turner Prize in 2018. “But it is not naive. The story is tragic, but it’s more Shakespearean than Greek. Failure was not inevitable.”

Taus Makhacheva

Born: 1983

Based in: Moscow

Appeared in: Ural Industrial Biennial 2017; Liverpool Biennial 2018; Manifesta 2018; Riga Biennial 2018; Yinchuan Biennale 2018; Art Encounters Biennial (Romania) 2019; Lyon Biennale 2019; Bangkok Biennale 2020; Lahore Biennial 2020; Yokohama Triennale 2020

Notable Works: Tightrope (2015); Quantitative Inﬁnity of the Objective (2019)

The artist made a splash in the international art world with Tightrope (2015), a video that captured a tightrope walker carrying 61 copies of works from the collection of the Dagestan Museum of Fine Art across a Caucasus ravine. Like much of Makhacheva’s work, the video—which was included in the 2017 Venice Biennale—explores the factors that shape national identity and what happens when two cultures collide. (The artist grew up in Moscow but her roots are in Dagestan, which came under Russian control in the early 19th century.)

Since then, Makhacheva has moved away from work focused on specific geographies to explore physical and emotional transformation. At the 2018 Liverpool Biennale, she set up a fully functioning spa with custom beauty products and ASMR video backdrops. At the Yokohama Triennale, she presented Quantitative Inﬁnity of the Objective (also shortlisted for the Future Generation Art Prize), a room full of offbeat gym equipment that was activated by live gymnasts.

Zheng Bo

Born: 1974

Based in: Lantau Island, Hong Kong

Appeared in: Manifesta 2018; Taipei Biennial 2018; Thailand Biennale 2018; Yinchuan Biennale 2018; Yokohama Triennale 2020; Guangzhou Image Triennial 2021; Liverpool Biennial 2021; Hawai’i Triennial 2022; Venice Biennale 2022; Sydney Biennale 2022

Notable works: Pteridophilia (2016–); Le Sacre du printemps (Tandvärkstallen) (2021)

Born in Beijing, Zheng now resides on Hong Kong’s largest outlying island of Lantau, one of the financial hub’s last vestiges of nature. This choice of habitat is almost a mirror of his socially and ecologically engaged art practice.

Zheng’s ongoing research, performance, and video art investigates human-plant coexistence, “inviting us to rethink our positions and relationships with nature, ecology, and social aspects in our world,” independent curator Angelika Li told Artnet News. The notion of interconnectedness among all living beings explored in Zheng’s work resonates especially strongly in the wake of the pandemic, Li added: “His projects create space for us to breathe and meditate, bringing us the awareness of the meditative and spiritual qualities from nature, the qualities that we once were not aware of.”

Forensic Architecture

Established: 2010

Based in: London

Appeared in: Ural Industrial Biennial 2017; Manifesta 2018; Moscow Biennale 2018; Shanghai Biennale 2018; Art Encounters Biennial (Romania) 2019; Whitney Biennial 2019; Bienal de Arte Paiz 2021; Berlin Biennale 2022; Biennale Warszawa 2022

Notable Works: The Long Duration of a Split Second (2018–19); Triple Chaser (2019)

Formed in 2010 under the auspices of the art school Goldsmiths, Forensic Architecture has grown into a hybrid research center, watchdog organization, and art collective with powerful allies like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. The group of data analysts, architects, sound engineers, and even smell specialists use everything from cell-phone video to detailed reenactments in order to uncover lies, human rights violations, and crimes committed by some of the world’s most powerful.

One of the group’s most impactful projects, The Long Duration of a Split Second, began as a means to clarify what exactly happened on the night hundreds of Israeli policemen raided a Bedouin village to demolish a few houses and two people ended up dead. Compiling footage and sound clips recorded by witnesses, as well as interviews, models, and press clippings, Forensic Architecture was able to prove that police had, indeed, opened fire first. Its video installations, which have been displayed at museums and biennials around the globe, stubbornly refuse to aestheticize these investigations, and instead lay out in clear-eyed, methodical fashion how the collective arrives at its conclusions.

Laure Prouvost

Born: 1978

Based in: Brussels

Appeared in: Industrial Art Biennial (Croatia) 2018; Baltic Triennial 2018; Moscow Biennale 2018; Sydney Biennale 2020; Art Encounters Biennial (Romania) 2021; Bienalsur 2021; Sonsbeek 2021; Busan Biennale 2022

Notable Works: Wantee (2013); DIT LEARN (2017)

Don’t believe everything you read about Laure Prouvost. The Lille-born artist is known for blending fact and fiction in her videos, multimedia installations, tapestries, and other work. The project that won her the Turner Prize, Wantee (2013), tells the fictional story of her grandfather, a famous conceptual artist who disappeared into a tunnel under his house. Deconstruction and disorientation are common themes: For the 2017 Venice Biennale, for which she represented France, Prouvost invited visitors to enter the pavilion from underground and walk through a labyrinth of videos and performances in a space that evoked a drained ocean. Octopuses, breasts, and punny language also make frequent appearances in Prouvost’s surreal, arch work.

Hito Steyerl

Born: 1966

Based in: Berlin

Appeared in: Skulptur Projekte Münster 2017; Bienalsur 2017; Jakarta Biennale 2017; Busan Biennale 2018; Ghost Festival 2018; Kyiv Biennial 2019; OpenArt (Sweden) 2019; Venice Biennale 2019; Art Encounters Biennial (Romania) 2021

Notable Works: Liquidity, Inc. (2014); Factory of the Sun (2015)

The Munich-born artist is known for videos and installations that explore financial systems, surveillance, migration, and militarization through a mix of barbed humor and dogged research. She’s not afraid to bite the hand that feeds her: she declined the German government’s Federal Cross of Merit to protest its failure to support artists during lockdown, and created an augmented reality app for her show at the Serpentine that erased the Sackler family’s name from the facade. (The gallery has since done the same IRL.) One of her contributions to the 2019 Venice Biennale was Leonardo’s Submarine, a video installation targeting the arms manufacturer Finmeccanica, which has supplied weapons used by the Turkish armed forces against civilians in Syria and sold war planes to Saudi Arabia.

Marwa Arsanios

Born: 1978

Based: Berlin and Beirut

Appeared in: Gwangju Biennale 2018; Luleå Biennial 2018; Qalandiya International 2018; Biennale Warszawa 2019; Sharjah Biennial 2019; Berlin Biennale 2020; Lahore Biennial 2020; Documenta 2022; Mardin Biennial 2022

Notable Works: Who is Afraid of Ideology (2017–21)

Architectural models, magazine back issues, topographic maps, first-person interviews—these are the materials that fuel the work of Marwa Arsanios. Born in Washington, D.C. and educated at the Lebanese American University in Beirut and the University of the Arts, London, Arsanios creates films, installations, and even textiles that emerge from a rigorous research process.

Much of her work examines dynamics at the intersection of feminist politics, resistance movements, and struggles over land. Her ambitious film series Who is Afraid of Ideology (2017–21) knits together the experiences of Indigenous farmers and organizers in Colombia, Mexico, Syria, Iraq, and northern Lebanon, as well as activists from the Kurdish autonomous women’s movement.

Monira Al Qadiri

Born: 1983

Based in: Berlin

Appeared in: Asia Pacific Triennial 2018; Athens Biennale 2018; Luleå Biennial 2018; Aichi Triennale 2019; Seoul Mediacity Biennale 2021; Venice Biennale 2022; Sharjah Biennial 2023; Asian Art Biennial (Taiwan) 2021; Guangzhou Image Triennial 2021

Notable Works: Alien Technology (2014–19); OR-BIT (2016)

Al Qadiri was born in Senegal, where her father was a diplomat, grew up in Kuwait, moved to Japan by herself when she was 16 years old, and now lives in Berlin. “As an artist I don’t feel like I belong anywhere,” she said in a recent interview. “I am a mutant.”

Working in a variety of media including film, installation, and sculptural objects that range from neon signs to robotics, she explores such subjects as unconventional gender identities, petrol culture, and the death of international diplomacy. Alien abductions and floating hamburgers have made an appearance here and there. “I see all my work as a self-portrait,” she said. “Even though it’s a sculpture or a video, even though I am not in it.”

For this year’s Venice Biennale, Al Qadiri contributed sculptures resembling oil drills coated in iridescent automotive paint—at once glittery trophies and symbols of environmental devastation.

Shezad Dawood

Born: 1974

Based in: London

Appeared in: Gwangju Biennale 2018; Lahore Biennial 2018; Sharjah Biennial 2019; Toronto Biennial 2019; Dhaka Art Summit 2020; Lahore Biennial 2020; Folkestone Triennial 2021; Toronto Biennial 2022; Desert X AlUla 2022

Notable Works: Towards the Possible Film (2014); Leviathan (2017-ongoing)

Difficult to pin down, Dawood works across a range of medium, from experimental film to virtual reality, from neon to textiles. He’s drawn to unexpected contrasts, non-linear time, the the blurry line between fact and fiction. “For me it’s about avoiding the didactic,” he said in Bomb. “It’s about work being historically and epistemologically researched to the point that you can hit the self-destruct button on your own set of references.”

His works can be urgent though: His massive, 10-part project Leviathan, begun at the 2017 Venice Biennale and emerging from his conversations with a variety of scientists and thinkers, looks at the environmental crisis through the lens of post-apocalyptic myth-making.

Tabita Rezaire

Born: 1989

Based in: Cayenne, French Guiana

Appeared in: Performa 2017; Athens Biennale 2018; Guangzhou Triennial 2018; Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2018; Moscow International Biennale for Young Art 2018; Göteborg Biennial 2021; Shanghai Biennale 2021; Biennale Gherdëina 2022; Sydney Biennale 2022

Notable Works: Sugar Walls Teardom (2016); Mamelles Ancestrales (2019); Deep Down Tidal (2017)

New media artist Rezaire’s practice is focused on the concept of healing. She often appears as a “digital shaman” in her trippy, psychedelic videos and prints. Inspired by quantum and cosmic mechanics, she “uses art as a means to unfold the soul,” according to her website. Her digital healing and energy streams are intended to remind viewers to access “our own inner data center, to bypass western authority and download directly from source.”

Mamelles Ancestrales, presented at the Sydney Biennale, is inspired by African interpretations of the cosmos as well as the ancient stone circle monuments referenced in her work, calling into question whether scientific explanations should supersede spiritual ones. Meanwhile, Deep Down Tidal—seen at the water-themed 23rd Biennale of Sydney—“navigates the ocean as a graveyard for Black knowledge and technologies,” the artist says. “Research suggests that water has the ability to memorize and copy information, disseminating it through its streams. What data is our world’s water holding?”

Alicja Kwade

Born: 1979

Based in: Berlin

Appeared in: ARoS Triennial 2017; Biennale Gherdëina 2018; Thailand Biennale 2018; Desert X AlUla 2020; Helsinki Biennial 2020; Desert X 2021; Riga Biennial 2022; Setouchi Triennale 2022

Notable Works: Pars pro Toto (2018); ParaPivot I and II (2019); Big Be-Hide (2019)

In theory, this Poland-born artist is about as heady as it gets, dealing about the nature of time, reality, and space, and riffing on science and philosophy. “Reality is just a term—a construction,” she told Bomb on the occasion of her rooftop commission, Pars pro Toto, for the Metropolitan Museum in New York. “There are only descriptions that relate to our reality. Nobody knows what reality means, and there are different ways to understand it.”

In person, however, her work is a startling sensual form of conceptual minimalism. Kwade has benefited from a rage for shows engaging with nature. Works from her “Be-Hide” series, showing stones artfully positioned in nature facing mirrors, were shown at the garden-themed ARoS Triennial in Aarhus, Denmark, at the first Thailand Biennale, “Edge of Wonderland,” which was staged outdoors, and at Helsinki Biennial’s ecology-themed premier edition.

Cian Dayrit

Born: 1989

Based in: Manila, the Philippines

Appeared in: Berlin Biennale 2020; Göteborg Biennial 2019; New Museum Triennial 2018; Momentum Biennial 2021; Gwangju Biennale 2021; Sydney Biennale 2022; Dhaka Art Summit 2018; Kathmandu Triennale 2022

Notable Works: Anatomy of Aggression I and II (2020); Tropical Terror Tapestry (2020); ​ Occultas Archipelagus (2017); Civilized Society (2017)

“Counter-cartography” is a phrase Filipino artist Cian Dayrit has used to describe his best known works, an ongoing series of hand-embroidered textiles that transform historic maps into portraits of contemporary social conditions. But the term also broadly outlines his practice, which seeks to chart the ways in which imperialism, ​​industrialization, and other systems of subjugation have shaped geographical boundaries and cultural narratives across the Global South—especially in his home country of the Philippines. “I wanted to challenge the perspectives that somehow monopolized the framing of history and heritage,” he told A Magazine Singapore in 2021. Often, Dayrit’s artistic efforts begin with community workshops around his hometown of Manila.

Halil Altindere

Born: 1971

Based in: Istanbul

Appeared in: Thessaloniki Biennale 2017; Gwangju Biennale 2018; Lahore Biennial 2018; Art Encounters Biennial (Romania) 2019; Bienalsur 2019; Venice Biennale 2019; Lahore Biennial 2020; Riga Biennial 2022

Notable Works: Wonderland (2013); Space Refugee (2016)

Altindere makes works that find engaging, creative ways to put the spotlight on very serious issues, in Turkey and beyond. In the era of the Taksim Square protests in Turkey, he became well known for Wonderland, a video that uses the form of a hip-hop music video to give visibility to the dispossession and alienation of Romani youth in Istanbul. Even more ambitious was his multi-part, multi-media piece Space Refugee, working with Muhammad Faris, the first Syrian astronaut who has since become a refugee from the Asad regime, both telling his story and imagining what a Martian space city for displaced Syrians might look like.

Ian Cheng

Born: 1984

Based in: Los Angeles

Appeared in: Bienalsur 2017; Yokohama Triennale 2017; Biennale de l’Image en Mouvement 2018; Ghost Festival 2018; October Salon/Belgrade Biennale 2018; Sharjah Biennial 2019; Venice Biennale 2019; October Salon/Belgrade Biennale 2021

Notable Works: BOB (Bag of Beliefs) (2018–19)

Ian Cheng is known for his “simulations,” video games that play themselves, with results surprising for both the viewer and the artist. These A.I. ecosystems star humans, plants, and creatures such as BOB (Bag of Beliefs) (2018–19), an interactive work of art centering on an evolving artificial intelligence creature with a physical appearance that evokes a serpent or coral, shown, among other places, at the 2019 Venice Biennale.

Life After Bob was Cheng’s first animated film, commissioned by the Shed, Luma Foundation, and Light Art Space, expanding on the BOB lore. It takes place “in a weird, volatile, and changing world, a very transitional world,” Cheng said in an interview, “similar to the world that we live in.”

James Bridle

Born: 1980

Based in: Greece and London

Appeared in: 2017 Thessaloniki Biennale; 2018 Manifesta Biennial; 2019 Coventry Biennial; 2019 Aichi Triennale; 2019 Vienna Biennale; 2021 Belgrade Biennale; 2021 Guangzhou Image Triennial; 2022 British Art Show

Notable Works: New Aesthetic (2011); Dronestagram (2012–15)

What will architecture look like in the future? How can we uncover and visualize the mechanisms of surveillance and control that exert power over us without our knowledge or consent? These and other questions are the subjects of the work of James Bridle.

The artist and writer’s projects have involved sending a self-driving car up Mount Parnassus, the classical home of the muses; creating a live video installation that ingests news coverage and directs visitors toward the point in Europe with the best (or least dangerous) opinions on refugees; and plotting aerial photographs of unreported drone-strike locations on the Instagram account Dronestagram. Through video, books, performance, installation, and more, Bridle aims to synthesize and visualize the hidden, diffuse forces that guide our world both on and offline.

Kader Attia

Born: 1970

Based in: Berlin

Appeared in: Gwangju Biennale 2018; Manifesta 2018; Prospect New Orleans 2018; Shanghai Biennale 2018; Lahore Biennial 2020; Bienalsur 2021; Aichi Triennale 2022; Sharjah Biennial 2023

Notable Works: Réfléchir la Mémoire (Reflecting Memory) (2016); The Body’s Legacies. The Post-Colonial Body (2018)

“Repair” is a key word for Attia, who thinks of himself as repairing and adapting culture rather than creating new culture from nothing. His works are poetic yet bracing, often putting colonialism and political trauma front and center in his installations and objects. For The Body’s Legacies. The Post-Colonial Body (2018), he interviewed four people whose ancestors were either enslaved or colonized, switching between registers of the intimate and the analytical.

“I’m very interested in ideas of keeping the thread of the genealogy and history of why we are here,” he said in an interview with the Harbourfront Center in 2018. Attia is also the curator of the 2022 Berlin Biennale—another way to bring many of the same themes to the international art circuit.

Marguerite Humeau

Born: 1986

Based in: London

Appeared in: October Salon/Belgrade Biennale 2018; Istanbul Biennial 2019; Riga Biennial 2020; October Salon/Belgrade Biennale 2021; Sydney Biennale 2022; British Art Show 2022; Toronto Biennial 2022; Venice Biennale 2022

Notable Works: The Myth Teller (2019); High Tide (2019); Migrations (2022)

Since she burst onto the scene in 2011 with The Opera of Prehistoric Creatures, a work that grew out of her thesis show at the Royal College of Art in London that saw her recreate the cry of the wooly mammoth, Humeau has been on quite a run.

Often her work takes the form of collaborating with scientists to solve some speculative puzzle about the past. From the process, she produces various eerie artworks, often appearing as eerie sculptures that look like aliens escaped from the lab. The works in her “High Tide” series, shown at the British Art Show in 2021, are inspired by the idea of animals achieving spiritual consciousness, emerging from her speculations about what non-human rituals creatures like elephants or chimpanzees might evolve to cope with their mortality, in an age of extinction.

“All the worlds I am creating are based on real facts; they are based on mysteries that I am trying to understand,” Humeau told Studio International. “I am extracting real things, and then expanding into ‘what if?’ scenarios.”

Munem Wasif

Born: 1978

As a photographer, Wasif is known for the elegance and poetry of black-and-white images, documenting life in Bangladesh in various ways. But he’s also moved beyond that medium, though with the same evocative sensibility: “At the end photography becomes irrelevant and it’s more about what you want to say,” Wasif has said. “The inspiration comes from literature, music, film, and life in general.”

For Machine Matter (2017), seen at the Sharjah Biennale, Wasif offered a meditative video installation reflection on the legacy of jute textiles in Bangladesh. At the Taipei Biennial, he presented Seeds Shall Set Us Free II, mixing archives and photography to create an installation in collaboration with UBINIG, a Dhaka-based organization that works against corporate agriculture, to give a sense of the collective struggles of farmers.

Clariant launches 100% bio-based surfactants range,"Louisville, KY – Clariant has developed a new bio-based product that aims to remove fossil carbon from the value chain.

Vita is a 100% bio-based surfactants and polyethylene glycols (PEGs) range that is fully based on bio-based, renewable carbon from plants – “answering the growing demand for bio-based chemicals is set to grow strongly in the coming years,” the company explained.

The introduction of 100% bio-based surfactants and PEGs significantly expands Clariant’s Vita designated ingredients. Vita products are based on renewable feedstocks and have at least 98% Renewable Carbon Index (RCI).

And it represents the latest example of Clariant’s commitment to provide low carbon footprint solutions to customers and to Greater Chemistry – between people and planet, noted Christian Vang, global head of Clairant’s business unit industrial & consumer specialties.

“From the packaging to the many ingredients, a typical consumer product in coatings, personal care, home care, industrial, and agricultural applications still uses petrochemicals and therefore fossil carbon,” He continued. “Switching to bio-based carbon chemistry remains a big challenge for manufacturers and by launching the Vita surfactant and PEG range we are offering them an important new solution to achieve this.”

Designed for natural formulations targeting a high Renewable Carbon Index (RCI), the new Vita products support manufacturers in maximizing the bio-based carbon content of consumer goods such as detergents, hair and body shampoo, paint, industrial lubricants and crop formulations.

As one of the world’s leaders in specialty chemicals and a member of the UN Global Compact, Clariant strives to be at the forefront of advanced carbon solutions. Clariant uses 100% bio-ethanol derived from sugar cane or corn to create the ethylene oxide for its innovative new surfactants and PEGs. The bio-based material is fully segregated along the value chain from the field to the final consumer product.",,[],['Home Textiles Today Staff']
New bio-based textile fiber from Nordic Bioproducts Group,"Nordic Bioproducts Group, a Finnish startup, has created a new plant-based textile fiber.

The market for man-made sustainable cellulosic plant-based textile fibers is expected to grow more than 10% in the next decade. Many startups in this space are Finnish, including Aalto University’s Ioncell fiber, Metsa Spring Oy’s Kuura fiber, Spinnova Oy’s fiber and Infinited Fibre Company’s Infinna fiber.

“Current methods have a detrimental impact on the environment,” Nordic Bioproducts Group said in a statement. “Resource-intensive cotton production is already at an extreme, and polyester, in turn, is a major source of microplastic emissions. And, the production of wood-based viscose fiber requires dissolution with toxic carbon disulfide.”

In the Nordic Bioproducts’ method, the cellulose is hydrolyzed in an environmentally-friendly and cost-efficient process. The fiber is then processed into a viscose-like textile fiber. The inventor of the AaltoCell method is Professor Olli Dahl at Aalto University.

The Norratex textile creation uses a wide variety of raw materials. It opens up this technology to multiple sustainable sources of fabric. Fibers can be made from forest industry by-products, textile waste and paper pulp.

“This is a significant advantage over traditional viscose, which is made from dissolving pulp and the cost can be up to 30% higher than paper pulp,” Nordic Bioproducts said.

The Norratex method is also being explored for possible use in textile recycling. Most fast fashion uses fiber blends containing both natural and plastic fibers, which makes recycling them a challenge. The AaltoCell technology offers one potential way to solve this problem by creating a new way to split the fibers into natural and plastic components.

Sustainable fashion: Biomaterial revolution replacing fur and skins,"Innovators around the globe are achieving inspiring results using natural sources, traditional knowledge, and advanced biotechnology techniques to develop sustainable materials for the fashion industry, replacing fur, leather and skins, and slashing the impacts of one of the world’s most polluting industries.

Although companies of this type still represent a tiny part of the global textile chain, such firms grew fivefold between 2017 and 2019. Executives of apparel companies recently surveyed say they “aspire to source at least half of their products with such materials by 2025.”

This shift in production and corporate mentality is due to several factors, including pressure from animal rights activists and environmental organizations, along with consumer demand, comes as the climate and environmental crises deepen.

“Sustainable materials are pivotal if we are to transform the fashion industry from one of the most polluting industries to one that is transformative, regenerative and more humane, caring both for the environment and the people it touches in its complex supply chain,” says fashion designer Carmen Hijosa.

In a globally interconnected world, textiles such as leather sourced from cattle, and wool sheared from sheep, have become a serious source of deforestation, other adverse land-use impacts, biodiversity loss and climate change, while fur farms (harvesting pelts from slaughtered mink, foxes, raccoon dogs and other cage-kept wild animals) have become a major biohazard to human health — a threat underlined by the risk fur farms pose to the current and future spread of zoonotic diseases like COVID-19.

But in a not-so-distant future, fashion biomaterials made from plant leaves, fruit waste, and lab-grown microorganisms may replace animal-derived textiles — including leather, fur, wool and silk — with implementation at first on a small but quickly expanding scale, but eventually on a global scale.

In fact, that trend is well underway. In less than a decade, dozens of startups have emerged, developing a range of biomaterials that, in addition to eliminating the use of animal products, incorporate sustainable practices into their production chains.

Not all these textile companies, mostly based in Europe and the United States, have fully achieved their goals, but they continue to experiment and work toward a new fashion paradigm. Among promising discoveries: vegan bioleather made with mycelium (the vegetative, threadlike part of fungi), and bioexotic skins made from cactus and pineapple leaves, grape skins and seeds, apple juice, banana stalks and coconut water. There are also new textiles based on algae that can act as carbon sinks, and vegan silk made from orange peel.

It’s all part of a promising sustainable textile revolution that has the potential to stylishly clothe both the high- and fast-fashion customer.

According to a 2019 report, “Fashion’s New Must-Have: Sustainable Sourcing at Scale,” researched by the McKinsey & Company consulting firm, sustainable materials only represent a small fraction of global fashion production today, but recorded a stunning “five-fold increase [in growth] over the past two years.”

Seventy-four such companies are listed in “The State of the Industry Report: Next-Gen Materials,” released last year by the Material Innovation Initiative (MII), a California-based nonprofit that promotes animal-free materials. Of that total, 42 firms were established since 2014. The number of companies is even longer, though. Firms like Post Carbon Lab (U.K.), Chip[s] Board (U.K.), and SeaWear, for example, aren’t listed.

These pathfinding multidisciplinary companies — staffed by designers, biochemists, genetic and material engineers, biologists and textile specialists — in addition to being suppliers of textiles, clothing and accessories to manufacturers, have also been partnering with major fashion brands to further develop their research and gain scale. Awards created by conglomerates such as the H&M Foundation and the Kering Group provide grants and technical support for projects in their early stages.

Sustainable fashion’s environmental implications

The evolution of sustainable biomaterials is largely a response to the need to reduce the environmental impact of the fashion industry, one of the worst planetary polluters. “The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of annual global carbon emissions, more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined [and responsible for] around 20% of worldwide wastewater [that] comes from fabric dyeing and treatment,” according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

The fashion industry is also connected to Amazon deforestation. The share of the Brazilian Amazon involved in the country’s leather production has been growing since 2000, when it was only 7%. That jumped to 27% in 2010 and 43% in 2020.

More than 100 global brands “are working with manufacturers and tanneries that are sourced from companies with links to cattle raised on recently deforested Amazon land,” according to a study released in November by Slow Factory, an NGO. Among them are Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Prada, Nike, Zara, H&M, Louis Vuitton, Coach and Tory Burch.

In fact, it was a visit to a leather tannery in the Philippines — her first ever in 15 years as a designer and consultant on luxury leather products — that convinced Carmen Hijosa to never work with animal skins again.

As part of their industrial process, tanneries need to prevent newly made leather from decomposing by altering its protein structure using a potent chemical cocktail containing potential human carcinogens, including formaldehyde and azo colorants.

Hijosa’s 1993 visit to the Philippine tannery spurred her research into leather alternatives. While still in the Philippines, the Spanish designer learned of an old local fashion tradition: the use of pineapple-leaf fibers to make handwoven textiles. So Hijosa focused her research on pineapple’s potential and went back to school to study textiles. In 2013, she founded a London startup, Ananas Anam. The next year, at age 62, she gained her Ph.D. The result of her journey is Piñatex, a trademarked fabric made from waste pineapple leaves and already sold in 80 countries.

“Sustainable materials are pivotal if we are to transform the fashion industry from one of the most polluting industries to one that is transformative, regenerative and more humane, caring both for the environment and the people it touches in its complex supply chain,” said Hijosa. “It is our responsibility as material designers and manufacturers to develop living systems that make this change possible.”

Piñatex still has a challenge to overcome: While its finishing coating is 50% bio-based, the other 50% is made up of a petroleum-based resin applied to strengthen the material. Ananas Anam is currently working with a chemical company to make a fully bio-based coating.

Plant substitutes for leather and fabrics

After working with organic cotton, hemp and bamboo fibers, the Swiss fashion company QWSTION learned about abacá, a plant in the banana family also native to the Philippines, with strong fibers. Used by locals to make textiles since before Europeans arrived in the 1500s, “the fiber had good potential to become a material for outdoor clothing and accessories,” Hannes Schönegger, QWSTION’s CEO and co-founder told Mongabay.

According to Schönegger, abacá is produced using permaculture, so is grown surrounded by other plant species rather than existing as a monoculture. “Very often it is cultivated with cocoa trees and bigger plants that give shade. [Only] the side stems from the banana plant are chopped off to extract the raw material, so it keeps on growing for 30-40 years.”

It took three years of research in partnership with a yarn specialist and a weaving manufacturer, both based in Taiwan, to create Bananatex, launched in 2018. In addition to accessories already made with the biodegradable fabric and sold in QWSTION’s flagship stores, other brands and retail partners are creating prototypes using the abacá-derived textile, with some products likely available to consumers soon, said Schönegger.

The company is also currently testing bacteria dyeing as an alternative to digital print, a method used in making handbags. “We try to use the least harmful dyes that are available in industrial quantities. However, dyeing is an area that definitely needs improvement, added Schönegger. Synthetic chemical textile dyes have a notorious history as pollutants.

Another major issue confronting Bananatex and other companies is the environmental impacts of the global fashion supply chain. In the case of Bananatex, its product is sourced in the Philippines, moves to Taiwan for processing, then to China for manufacture, and finally arrives in Europe to be sold in stores and also over the Internet. That globe-trotting itinerary generates a lot of greenhouse gas emissions.

“In an international economy — and the textile industry is one of the most globalized areas — it is best to produce close to where materials grow and distribute the [finished] products afterwards. Because of that, Bananatex was born from the idea of creating a supply chain with short distances in Asia,” said Schönegger. “Things have to be transported at some point. And a closer look often reveals unexpected facts: Transporting a backpack from Hong Kong to Hamburg by ship creates less CO2 than from Portugal to Hamburg by truck.”

Fur from a petri dish

Mink farms, long a target of animal rights activists, generally try to keep a very low profile. But that has become increasingly difficult since the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected U.S. and EU fur-producing mink farms in 2020, underlining the potential of those facilities for transmitting zoonotic diseases, and leading to calls by epidemiologists and public health experts for them to be shut down.

“Any time we can avoid housing animals in high-density settings, we diminish the risk of [animal-to-human, and human-to-wildlife] spillover events for potential pathogens. Raising animals for fur can certainly represent a high-density scenario. So if [alternatives to the] fur industry are successful, they could reduce fur farming and thus emerging infection disease risk,” Michael Oglesbee, director of the Infectious Diseases Institute in Columbus, Ohio, told Mongabay.

Current alternatives to animal fur are made mostly from recycled polyester, an entirely petroleum-based fiber that contributes to climate change. A potentially more environmentally friendly option is Koba, a brand owned by the Chinese company Ecopel, whose faux fur uses a synthetic fiber manufactured by chemical giant DuPont, but which is made from corn byproducts resulting from biofuel production and petroleum-derived terephthalic acid. Ecopel claims a 63% greenhouse gas emission reduction for its faux fur. Contacted by Mongabay, Ecopel did not respond for comment.

Some startups are paving the way for faux fur production through biotechnology, a field that modifies living organisms to develop a variety of products. One such firm is the Dutch company GENEUSBIOTECH, founded in 2017 by Henri Kunz, a serial biotechnology entrepreneur, and Maria Zakurnaeva, who worked in the fashion industry.

When Kunz and scientist Sundar Pattabiraman produced human hair follicles in vitro, Zakurnaeva had a revelation: “Why not take advantage of this technology to produce fur, and thus avoid the death of animals?” The research team expanded its work and is now even developing wool grown without sheep. Its biomaterial fur and wool products are being made under the FUROID brand.

“We are at a stage where we have produced small organoids, a three-dimensional mass of tissue, by growing induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs),” Pattabiraman, FUROID’s chief scientific officer, told Mongabay. “These cells have been proliferated to make hair-like protrusions coming out of them. But more extensive research needs to be performed to further this project in terms of reproducibility and to [achieve] a larger scale.”

The process uses stem cells, from which all other body cells with specialized functions are generated, which are obtained by biopsy from living mink and Merino sheep. In a next step, those cells are cultured and reprogrammed into iPSCs to make fur hair follicles.

“We use a maximum of five punch biopsies per animal, after approval from an ethics committee and under supervision of a veterinary doctor, who performs the anesthesia. All animals are kept as pets and monitored by experienced staff. We own five sheep at a university farm in New Zealand and five minks. They are sufficient to produce an endless supply of cell lines,” said Kunz. “The life expectancy of our donor animals is high, especially sheep, and we spare no effort and costs to give them the best life they deserve.”

GENEUSBIOTECH reports that its FUROID project has received a Horizon Europe grant from the EU in excess of 4 million euros ($4.4 million), and is also being supported financially by an angel donor, family and friends. The company is in talks with industry stakeholders as possible investors. The firm intends to eventually use more species as donor animals to create its biomaterials, including sable, fox and even crocodile.

Fashion bounty from the sea

Ocean species are also becoming a source of sustainable fabrics, says Mike Allen, an associate professor in the College of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Exeter, U.K.

“Marine microbes … evolved in the oceans over a billion years before [they did] in the terrestrial environment. Because of that, the oceans are teeming with metabolic diversity, which can offer solutions to many of our current and future problems. You name a problem, there is a microbe out there that can help overcome it,” Allen told Mongabay.

The marine biotechnologist explained the advantages of biological modes of production over more traditional ones: “Physical [production] processes generally demand a lot of energy (heat and pressure), while chemical ones are reliant on bulk commodity synthetics [which may be toxic] … As a result, fashion textiles are restricted in their nature.

“Biological solutions to materials, on the other hand, are usually smarter,” Allen continued. “They exploit living organisms to do the hard work with a lower energetic input of manufacturing, and have properties that you can control and engineer for your particular application. Strength, grip, biodegradability, water resistance, antimicrobial, color, luminescence, fluorescence, self-cleaning, self-repairing, self-lighting: You are limited only by your [own] imagination.”

There are many other examples of fashion biomaterial initiatives now underway with private companies around the globe. A few innovative examples: Vegan leather and exotic skins :

Mylo (U.S.): Biotechnology company Bolt Threads has developed a textile derived from mycelium, the root structure of fungi, and processed into leather-like sheets. Mylo is certified 50-85% bio-based, though it still employs chemicals in the tanning and dyeing process.

Desserto (Mexico): The Adriano Di Marti company cultivates nopal cactus in the state of Zacatecas, and it is the source of a new fashion material launched in 2019. Nourished by rainwater, the plant’s leaves are cut just twice a year, while no toxic chemicals are used in manufacture.

Vegea (Italy): Grape skins, seeds and stalks discarded during wine production have been used by this company to make vegetal leather since 2016. Its website states that no toxic solvents or heavy metals are involved in its processes.

Malai (India): This company collects coconut water discarded by processing plants that use only the white flesh from the tropical fruit. This natural liquid, once disposed of in the local sewage system, causing destructive soil acidification, is now sterilized and serves as food for a bacterial culture. This growth process results in a sheet of cellulose jelly, which is later reinforced with natural fibers and resinous ingredients, making a product similar to leather. Yarns and molded fashions :

Alga-Life (Germany): Founded in 2016, this firm makes threads and textile dyes by purifying proteins from algae, which are then blended with natural ingredients such as pomegranate rind and juniper needles. The system only needs sunlight and water to operate, and the process creates no waste.

MycoTEX (Netherlands): NEFFA makes customized clothing by growing a compostable mycelium textile, which, once harvested, can be shaped within a 3D mold into finished apparel. Once dry, the garment is ready to wear, having eliminated multiple traditional manufacturing steps such as the spinning of yarns and weaving of cloth. The process uses only 0.5% of the water consumed in conventional cotton production. Animal-free wool :

WOOCOA (Colombia): A group of students from the University of the Andes, in Bogotá, developed a substitute for wool that is 100% biodegradable, winning the 2018 Biodesign Stella McCartney and PETA Prize for Animal-Free Wool. They used coconut and hemp fibers, treated with enzymes extracted from oyster mushrooms, to create a bio-based regenerative animal-free wool.

Consumers driving sustainable fashion movement

As with any business, it is consumer demand and profits that are driving the conversion from wild and domestic animal-sourced fashion materials, to plant and other biologically based materials.

This seismic shift in consumer desires has become clear in recent news: For example, in 2021, after more than 25 years of partnership, the Miss New Hampshire state beauty competition in the U.S. ended its relationship with the New Hampshire Trappers Association, a promoter of wildlife trapping that long donated a fur coat to the winner.

“Former contestants spoke publicly against the obligation to accept a fur coat as part of the prize. That antiquated tradition helped perpetuate the use of body-gripping traps, which are still allowed in the state,” Kristina Snyder, an animal rights activist and co-creator of the New Hampshire Citizens Against Recreational Trapping (NHCART) website, told Mongabay.

At the international level, trendsetting Elle magazine announced in 2021 that it is banning fur from all its 45 global editions, printed and online. According to Elle senior vice president and international director Valeria Bessolo Llopiz, “[A] fur-free future is a great opportunity to increase awareness for animal welfare, bolster the demand for sustainable and innovative alternatives and foster a more humane fashion industry.”

From textiles to therapies: North Carolina’s journey to a booming biotech hub,"The states currently boasts 94 biopharma manufacturing sites employing 28,000 people: ranking it the third in the US for pharma manufacturing. In cell and gene therapy, the Research Triangle Region boasts everything needed to bring therapies from conception to commercialization. And looking forward, the established life science ecosystem is ready to bring emerging therapies to market.

Building a biotech hub

In the early 1980s, three of North Carolina’s largest industries – tobacco, textiles and furniture – were in decline.

“North Carolina leaders, from business to policymakers, recognized that genetic engineering and other new technologies coming out of bioscience research labs had enormous potential. They also knew ​agriculture and medicine – the state’s largest industries – were areas that new technology could transform,” ​Christopher Chung, CEO of The Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina (EDPNC), told BioPharma-Reporter.

“In 1984, the state’s elected and business leaders established the North Carolina Biotechnology Center (NCBiotech) in Research Triangle Park. The independent, non-profit corporation became the nation's first state-sponsored initiative in life sciences development with a goal to create high paying jobs, strengthen universities and encourage new company formation.”​

Research Triangle Park is now the largest research park in the US with 7,000 acres housing more than 300 companies: not only in biopharma but also in wider science and technology sectors.

“Located in the heart of the state’s triangle of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill, Research Triangle Park (RTP) is the world’s original research park and a major life sciences and tech magnet that has created a thriving life sciences ecosytem, which has since grown state-wide.”​

Cell and gene therapies​

Today, the life sciences sector generates more than $83.3bn in annual economic impact and nearly $2.2bn in state and local government tax revenues.

There are more than 790 life sciences companies in NC, ranging from entrepreneurial startups to multinational conglomerates including Eli Lilly, Pfizer, FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies, Labcorp, IQVIA, PPD clinical research services, Merck, Thermo Fisher, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, BASF, Biogen, Baxter among others.

This includes over 250 companies and more than 50,000 workers supporting biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries alone: which has grown 25% since 2010.

The cell and gene therapy industry in particular has been spurred on by bringing together expertise in academia and investment.

The Research Triangle now has everything needed to bring gene and cell therapies to market: through from conception to commercialization. An early start in the industry has helped the sector, with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill one of the original birthplaces of gene therapy research and now home to the UNC School of Medicine Gene Therapy Center, founded in 1993 by pioneer R. Jude Samulski, PhD.

Most recently, Pifzer announced in December it would pump another $68.5m into a new facility in Durham to advance gene therapy capabilities.

Pfizer’s $800m investment to build three scalable, state-of-the-art gene therapy manufacturing facilities includes 300,000 square feet of capacity, one of the largest in-house gene therapy manufacturing facilities, to support multiple gene therapy medicines. This includes a total bioreactor manufacturing capacity of 22,000 liters, (2,000 liters / bioreactor x 11 bioreactors) using single-use manufacturing technology, allowing more scalable expansion of manufacturing capacity over time. These investments have given Pfizer one of the largest production capacities for gene therapy vectors globally.

“​North Carolina is a leading hub for cell- and gene-based therapies. Beginning with announcements from Pfizer and bluebird bio in 2017, companies promised to invest $1.1bn and create 1,600 jobs through 2020.​

“The ​roster of related companies​ includes Audentes (an Astellas company), Beam Therapeutics, Biogen, Cellectis, Jaguar Gene Therapy, Kriya Therapeutics, Novartis Gene Therapies, Sio Gene Therapies, StrideBio and Taysha Gene Therapies.​ Home-grown entrepreneurial companies AskBio, Atsena Therapeutics, Locus Biosciences, Precision BioSciences and Stride Bio continue to push cell and gene therapies forward.”​

Another strength for the state is the largest global concentration of contract research and testing organizations.

""The world's first clinical trials management company started on the UNC campus. Today it’s IQVIA, with 75,000 global employees in 100 countries. Other global leaders in this class of CRO with North Carolina headquarters include PPD, now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, PRA Health Sciences, Parexel and Syneos Health. Labcorp leads the diagnostic and testing space from its headquarters in Burlington.""​

Building up skills

Skills shortages are a well-known problem for the industry, and North Carolina hopes to tackle this with its strong academic institutions such as Duke University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina State University, East Carolina University and Wake Forest University

Furthermore, the state has mechanisms in place to connect research and academic with funding and business opportunities.

""NCBiotech works to connect companies with university researchers and introduce entrepreneurs to potential funders. Transformation even happens on an individual level as job seekers find opportunity in the life sciences field,""​ explained Chung.

North Carolina is a leader in forming public/private partnerships to benefit the state’s economy via the life sciences, he adds. In December, a coalition led by NCBiotech and EDPNC was awarded $500,000 in the federal Build Back Better Regional Challenge award​: thanks to a wide-ranging proposal entitled “Accelerating Life Science Manufacturing to Create Economic Resilience and Promote Equity in Distressed North Carolina Communities.

The Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina (EDPNC) is focused on recruiting new businesses to the state, supporting the needs of existing businesses, connecting exporters to global customers, and helping small business owners get their start. It works closely with public- and private-sector partners at the state, regional and local levels. As a nonprofit public-private partnership, the EDPNC operates under contract with the North Carolina Department of Commerce, while receiving additional financial support from the private sector. It is governed by an 18-member board of business and industry leaders.

""The Phase 1 award is helping academia, industry, state and local government, and other partners to work together to develop strategies that can expand, connect, scale, and promote the state’s life sciences manufacturing cluster.""​

In manufacturing, North Carolina has 58 community colleges providing training for careers in biopharma manufacturing including programs developed in collaboration with employers to train workers in specific skills.

“As innovative approaches and curative therapies emerge and bring new hope to patients with rare diseases, the state’s established life science ecosystem, including some of the world’s largest clinical research organizations, is well-positioned to move these life-changing therapies from concept to market.”​",,[],['Rachel Arthur']

Underwear Made Using the Best Biodegradable Textiles,"Generally speaking, we don’t give much thought to our underwear. If it’s comfy, we’ll wear it until its dying days without ever looking at the materials it’s made out of. But here’s a (not so) fun fact: only 2% of underwear is sustainably sourced. Now, however, it may be time to check the label first, as some new biomaterials are making their quiet debut appearances in undies.

Biodegradable fabrics decompose quite easily and naturally due to microorganisms; the more chemicals used to create the fabric, the longer it takes to biodegrade. There are currently big developments in using funghi, particularly mycelium, for faux-leather fashion pieces, as seen in Stella McCartney’s and Hermes’ newest collections.

UK-based Stripe and Stare, an underwear, sleepwear and loungewear company, have decided to create the world’s first 100% biodegradable underwear and sleepwear line. Their statement of “Designed in London. Grown in a forest. Composted in your garden” is heard loud and clear in this collection. The most interesting thing about the launch, however, is how it uses several biomaterials to create the items.

It combines Tencel, SeaCell and Roica V550 to create a harmonious item that is both comfortable to touch, resistant to washing and biodegradable. After being buried in soil, the Stripe and Stare undies take just around 180 days to fully break down and decompose safely.

Let’s get down to the nitty gritty of these materials.

Tencel: According to Tencel’s website, “the name means ‘Ten’ for the tenacity of the fabric and ‘cel’ because it is made from cellulose or wood fibre.” Tencel Modal fibers are an incredibly soft, natural, and sustainable fiber made from wood pulp. Considered a milestone in the R&D of environmentally sustainable textiles due to it’s incredible softness, color retention, breathability, and moisture management, Tencel fibers are made exclusively in Austria by Lenzing. In Austria, the fibers are extracted from Beech wood forests, grown without any chemical fertilizers or artificial irrigation, using 95% less water to produce when compared to cotton. Lenzing also claims that 100% of the water used in the production process of pulp-to-fiber is reused. 100% of the raw Beech wood material is “converted into cellulose and other bio-based, bio-refinery products, and the surplus energy is recycled into the production of other fibers at the same production site”, according to the company.

SeaCell: Produced by German company smartfiber AG, Seacell is sustainably produced from algae and wood cellulose fibers. Rich in vitamins, trace elements, amino acids and minerals, the material is gentle on even the most sensitive skins. Smartfiber AG’s process is clean and sustainable and saves energy and resources; the algae used is carefully washed, dried, ground and incorporated into cellulose fiber, from which textiles are made. According to the company, “Harvesting of the seaweed is a gentle, selective and, most importantly, sustainable process. It removes only the part of the seaweed that is able to regenerate. The seaweed is entirely untreated and all its ecological value is retained.”

Roica V550: Invented in Japan by Asahi Kasei, the Roica family of materials gives clothing it’s staple stretchiness, replacing traditional elastane that can take 50-200 years to biodegrade. Roice is a groundbreaking material, as it’s the world’s first 100% compostable stretch fibre, biodegrading in just 6 months without releasing any toxic substances and decomposing to CO2 and water. Certified Cradle to Cradle Gold and Hohenstein Environment Compatibility Certified, Roica is “the premium stretch fiber by, the global leader in development and manufacturing of innovative materials, has been bringing together high-tech performance and certified sustainability.”

Whilst these innovative biomaterials certainly represent a clear future and path for green fashion, it’s also important to note that the price of sustainability is high. Even Eileen Fisher has admitted that “The clothing industry is the second largest polluter in the world … second only to oil. It’s a really nasty business … it’s a mess.” and Rachel Grant, founder and CEO of unisex luxury brand Bad Decision Adventure Club has also acknowledged the difficulty of mass-purchase of these products: “The reason why it can get so expensive is because it takes low-impact organic crops to produce them. They are typically grown without pesticides and synthetic fertilizers and can’t be genetically modified. There are very strict federal guidelines to be certified organic which is why it’s more expensive to mill organic or recycled fabrics — you’re paying for conscious fashion.”

Humble Bee Bio to Develop Sustainable Water-Repellent Textile Coating,"Deakin University and New Zealand-based biotechnology research company, Humble Bee Bio have received a grant of $70,000 from the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (IMCRC). The funding is destined for the development of a sustainable alternative to the harmful chemicals used in durable water repellent (DWR) textile coatings.

The project will be based at Deakin’s Institute for Frontier Materials (IFM) and supported by the Australian National Fabrication Facility. It’s estimated to be a 7- month project and worth a total of $566,000 cash and in-kind funding.

Veronica Harwood-Stevenson, Humble Bee Bio’s CEO and founder said the research collaboration would be instrumental to the success of the next stage of development for Humble Bee Bio’s novel biopolymer.

“By mimicking the properties of the solitary masked bee’s cellophane-like nesting material, we have created a biopolymer that’s water-repellent and resistant to flames, high temperatures and strong chemicals,” she said.

“This research collaboration will enable Humble Bee Bio to take our proof of concept and develop a formulation and production method for sustainable DWR biopolymer coatings. Australia is poised to become an advanced biomanufacturing centre of the world, and we are thrilled to be part of building that success.”

Professor Joselito Razal, director of ARC Research Hub for Future Fibres at IFM, said “Deakin University will utilise its world class expertise and facilities in fibre and materials science to facilitate Humble Bee Bio’s vision of a sustainable Australian textile industry,” he added that the project reinforced Deakin’s commitment to re-designing materials for a circular economy.

Dr Dylan Hegh, IFM’s Circular Economy Initiatives manager and project lead, said that the research would provide Humblee Bee Bio with an advanced understanding of the novel material and its properties.

“In refining the formulation, this collaboration has the potential to uncover new and unforeseen applications for the biopolymer and catalyse further research and development into advanced biomanufacturing,” Hegh said.

Dr Matthew Young, IMCRC’s Manufacturing Innovation manager, said IMCRC was pleased to be supporting the industry-university research collaboration by co-funding the development of Humble Bee Bio’s biopolymer.

“Novel advanced materials are playing a crucial role in achieving a more sustainable future for Australia and the rest of the world,” Young said. “Once commercialised, Humble Bee Bio’s sustainable DWR coatings have the potential to bridge a significant gap that exists within the textiles industry today.”

“By uniting industries and research institutions, we create an ecosystem that drives innovation and commercialisation, generating significant opportunities in specialised, high-value manufacturing.”",,[],[]
Creating Sustainable Textiles From Seaweed,"Thought Leaders Anna Watkins Director Uncommon Alchemy

AZoM speaks with Anna Watkins about her business Uncommon Alchemy, which is developing an exciting novel textile material made from seaweed.

Please can you introduce yourself and your research/professional background?

I’m a material innovator working on sustainable materials for the fashion industry. My company, Uncommon Alchemy, is currently developing a 100% biobased alternative to leather, made using seaweed as the main raw material.



What inspired you to begin researching and developing new materials?

I come from a creative background in fashion/textiles, and during my undergraduate degree I realized that what really interested me about textiles was the materiality of it rather than the garment design itself. I became really frustrated with the lack of sustainable materials available and felt that in a lot of cases, choosing a so-called “sustainable” option resulted in too much compromise.

I started researching biomaterials, found some open-source recipes online, and began experimenting. I fell in love with the process and started developing my own materials. I’ve been developing seaweed leather ever since.



The fashion and textile industry has become notoriously unsustainable. What are some of the key issues that we need to tackle in this sector?

As with all sustainability issues, there’s not one simple answer. In my practice, I focus on using natural raw materials, green chemistry, and adopting circular principles. Raw materials and biodegradability are one part of the problem, but from a wider perspective, what we really need is system change throughout the fashion industry. We need better raw materials and better ways of capturing and reprocessing waste – innovation needs to happen across the value chain. We also need to find better ways of communicating with consumers about sustainable options.

We need to communicate that sustainability is not about making one perfect choice, but rather that it is a set of decisions that are complex and subjective – and then, of course, we need to equip consumers to make those decisions based on the facts. The bright side is that there is loads of really exciting work going on across all aspects of the fashion industry, and a lot of push from consumers and industry to fix these problems.

You have developed a novel material that uses seaweed to produce a high-quality textile. What are the properties of the material?

Seaweed leather is being designed to perform to the same standards you’d expect from any other fashion leather alternative – so for end consumers, that means being aesthetically attractive and standing up to the rigors of day-to-day use. For brands, that means acting as a direct substitute in their current manufacturing processes.

One of the great things about this material is that it is highly customizable in terms of color and texture, so the design possibilities are endless. And unlike most other leather alternatives, it will also be fully biodegradable when it reaches its end of life.



What are the environmental benefits of your novel textile?

The benefits start with the raw material itself – seaweed. Seaweed plays a vital role in ecosystems and actually has bioremediation effects: it captures carbon and it can also absorb nitrogen and phosphorous from eutrophied waters. Seaweed can help to mitigate wave energy, which can aid in preventing coastal erosion, and it can also provide sheltered habitats for marine wildlife. Cultivated and harvested properly, it benefits the environment and provides a versatile bio-source for materials like this one.

When it comes to the material itself, there are also several benefits. The type of seaweed we use can be processed using safe, green chemical processes, and the end result is a biodegradable, non-toxic material. We are also looking at ways to re-use waste from the process to make the system circular.



How does material from seaweed compare to vegan leathers and other materials that are described as sustainable?

Animal leather has a lot of environmental problems, which I think people are becoming more aware of. There’s a growing market for ‘vegan’ leathers, but I think a lot of people don’t always realize that typically, that just means petrochemical plastics instead. There are lots of exciting things going on in the biobased leather market, but again, lots of these materials are marketed as biobased but it’s not always clear to the consumer that many of the plant-based vegan leathers contain polyurethane as a binding or coating agent.

Even when that PU is plant-based, it can still be hard to recycle and it means that they’re not fully biodegradable. Seaweed leather aims to be 100% biobased and well as fully biodegradable, solving this problem whilst coming from a regenerative resource.

You were named one of Innovate UK’s Young Innovators and spoke at ChemUK in 2021 about your project. How did it feel to be recognized for your work and to be able to spotlight your achievements on these platforms?

This started as a passion project for me, cooking up slime in a saucepan in my student flat. It’s come such a long way since then, as I’ve become more and more interested in scaling up and technical development. The Young Innovators Program (run by Innovate UK and KTN) has been such an amazing opportunity and completely changed how I do things – it’s given me a roadmap to commerciality for this material. ChemUK was brilliant because it was the first time I’d presented my work to industry. These kinds of things validate what I’m doing, and show how far it’s come.

Are there any limitations of this material that are still to be overcome?

The reason most biobased materials use PU as a binding or coating agent is that most biomaterials inherently lack water resistance. This is a challenge for us as well. We’re currently working on adapting the material and making it water-resistant as well, so that it can perform to the same standards as other leather materials without needing to rely on petrochemicals



Your company Uncommon Alchemy is currently developing this material into commercial products. What do you hope to achieve with this business?

We aim to provide the fashion industry with a leather alternative that meets the aesthetic and functional standards brands and customers will expect, without compromising on sustainability. The aim is to produce the material as a direct replacement, selling to brands who want to move away from petrochemical plastics and animal products. Our process will allow a high level of customizability so that brands can access exclusive textures and colours to meet their needs.



What are the next steps for your research and business?

We’re currently investigating pilot-scale production so that we can begin producing larger quantities of the material for testing and partnership with early adopters while we work on overcoming the last few technical hurdles around water resistance. It’s a really exciting time for us as we start to scale up so that we can bring this material to market!

Plans for composite wave energy device,"Oscillating water column glides on the ocean surface and extracts power which is converted into electricity.

STRUCTeam, the independent composite engineering consultancy based in Cowes, UK, has supported the world’s leading wind turbine and blade manufacturers for over a decade. It is now extending its strategic insights to the application of composites in wave power with renewables company Ocean Energy and technical partners 3A Composites Core Materials and Sicomin.

Ocean Energy approached the STRUCTeam for support with an EU-funded Horizon European Framework Programme with the objective of securing a sustainable and competitive energy supply through renewable applications.

This centres around the development of an oscillating water column (OWC), named the ‘OE12 Buoy’. The wave energy convertor is designed to glide on the ocean surface and extract power from the motion of the water which is then converted into electricity.

As the project has evolved, the desire to achieve weight savings in the steel structure’s design has become a key objective. Technical partners 3A Composites Core Materials and Sicomin have been invited by STRUCTeam to collaborate with the supply of recycled core materials and bio-based epoxy resins to enable the light weighting process.

Weight savings

The current OE 12 Buoy prototype is manufactured from steel and does not incorporate any composite materials. The device weighs twenty-eight tons and measures twelve metres by six metres. STRUCTeam estimates a 30-50% reduction in weight could be possible through careful engineering and materials selection.

The benefits around weight reduction are clear and convincing. A lighter structure allows for simplified transportation and installation, and in turn, lower levelised cost of energy (LCOE). The environmental benefits of composites are also motivating factors, such as the potential reduction in C02 emissions, improved materials circularity and durability.

Each of the technical partners places a strong emphasis on the circularity of materials in the projects they undertake.

“After being contacted by Ocean Energy, our choice to bring these companies together was very deliberate,” said Julien Sellier, STRUCTeam managing director. “They possess extensive knowledge in the development and adoption of lightweight materials for large structures that transfer perfectly to this project.”

The partners have proposed technologies and design solutions to successfully replace traditional material choices in the buoy structure.

Epoxy formulator Sicomin has developed a range of environmentally-enhanced green epoxy systems derived from natural origins. The Greenpoxy range incorporates InfuGreen 810, a two-component product specially formulated for resin transfer processes such as injection and infusion.

3A has developed Airex T92 and proposed it is used throughout the composite buoy. A closed-cell, thermoplastic and recyclable polymer foam with exceptionally good mechanical properties, it has an extraordinary resistance to fatigue, is chemically stable, UV resistant and has negligible water absorption, making it ideal for marine applications. The core material is suitable for a wide variety of lightweight sandwich structures that are subject to static and dynamic loads.

All parties anticipate a successful funding bid and look forward to developing the preliminary specifications of the composite structure. STRUCTeam will then initiate a pre-study analysis, conduct a first assessment and finalise design requirements.

“Our wave devices have virtually no environmental impact so to extend their sustainability credentials in manufacture, installation and service is a crucial factor,” saids Sean Barrett, senior project engineer at Ocean Energy. “STRUCTeam and its partners have guided us through the initial design phase and made valuable recommendations.”

“Partnering with Tidal Vision is a win-win for our company, our customers and the environment,” said Eric Westgate, Leigh Fibers. “Their Tidal-Tex product line delivers the key benefits that our customers look for in textiles at a lower price and is made from sustainable materials in the USA.”

Tidal-Tex is a water-based textile treatment solution that is formulated with a non-toxic, biodegradable biopolymer called chitosan, the second most abundant biopolymer in the word. It is taken from the exoskeleton of crustaceans such as shrimp, clams and lobster. The chitosan bio-based treatments are then applied to fibers, yarn, woven or nonwoven textiles.

“Our company’s co-founders are from Juno, Alaska and were commercial fishermen who looked into finding alternate uses for the industry by-products that were being discarded,” said Kari Ingalls, Tidal Vision director of textile business development. “They knew that creating a sustainable product should not be a compromise on price, convenience or performance. The product had to be as good as or better than synthetic products, which can be toxic – in order to gain broad market adoption.”

Ingalls said they are now working to educate companies and consumers about the benefits of bio-friendly, non-toxic performance fabrics. Both companies said they are looking forward to the positive impact their partnership will have on the textile industry and the environment.

“Leigh Fibers is our ideal partner since their mission, values and business model are so synergetic with ours,” said Tidal Vision CEO Craig Kasberg. “Both of our companies produce sustainable solutions by upcycling byproducts that would otherwise end up in landfills, and through vertical integration we provide high performance products out of what was previously considered waste.”

Tidal Vision is now opening a new 24,000-square-foot facility within Leigh Fiber’s 1,000,000-square-foot headquarters in South Carolina.

“We are currently getting our plant outfitted with their machinery,” said Brian Tickle, Leigh Fibers key account executive. “We did the ribbon cutting in mid-July. We’ve been working on the partnership for two years and are excited about educating the public about the benefits of these bio friendly textile treatments.”",,[],['Anne Flynn Wear']
Why the USDA certification matters to Precision Textiles’ FR solutions,"Precision Textiles lineup of FR solutions has received certification under the USDA's Biopreferred program.

Totowa, N.J. – Fire retardant solutions provider Precision Textiles has received sustainability certification from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for its portfolio of FR products.

The company’s collection of IQFit Glass Free, IQFit Contour, PurLoft and Endure products have been certified as bio-based products through the USDA’s BioPreferred Program. Under the program, the products are labeled as containing a USDA-verified amount of renewable, sustainable biological ingredients.

Reading Between the Design Lines,"This article is part of our latest Design special section, about new creative pathways shaped by the pandemic.

For more than a decade, the architect Rafael Herrin-Ferri has methodically combed Queens neighborhoods, fascinated by the range of what he describes as “levels of exhibitionism” in residences equipped with asymmetrical roof spikes and crimson-speckled facades. His book All the Queens Houses: An Architectural Portrait of New York’s Largest and Most Diverse Borough (Jovis, $22.99, 272 pp.) documents how Queens subdivision dwellers vie for attention with aqua awnings, watermelon stucco pigments and driveways patterned in sine waves. Simulated cracks slash across brickwork on townhouse chimney stacks, and mansards seem to be melting. He gently chides a “dead cat” crevice between homes that would be “impossible to clean” and a balcony on spindly stilts that has “the smooth surfaces and floating quality of a hydraulic car lift.” But he largely avoids judgment while devising formal titles for dwellings like Pixel Ghost, Cerulean Icebox, Minoan Makeover and Samurai Helmet House.",,[],['Eve M.

The next generation of biotech fabrics sending fashion sustainable,"From pineapple leather to rose silk and nettle hemp, these plant-based materials are swiftly replacing ones that cost the earth

Text Alex Peters

Anyone of sound mind and conscientious morals (which therefore rules out most politicians with the actual power to invoke change) has been aware for some time now that the planet is careening into environmental catastrophe. It is no longer sustainable to continue living the way we have been, and a seismic wide-scale shift is not just necessary, but vital. Thankfully, when it comes to fashion, the industry is finally waking up to the urgency of the matter after an initially slow start. This turnaround couldn’t come too soon, since it currently has a large, detrimental impact on the environment, whether through pollution and water contamination caused by cotton harvesting, the harmful chemical gases released into the atmosphere during polyester and nylon manufacturing, or the millions of tons of textile waste that end up in landfills every year. In an effort to combat this waste and pollution, brands including Stella McCartney, Hermès, adidas, and Nike are increasingly turning to sustainable biomaterials for their collections. Sounding like something out of a sci-fi movie about a futuristic alternate universe, these biomaterials range from actual human sweat to lab-grown orb spider silk to fully compostable leather created from mushroom foam. This mycelium leather is just one of the vegan leather alternatives making up what is set to become a US$89 billion market by 2025. Here are some of the plant-based biomaterials you should know about.

NETTLE & HEMP DENIM It takes roughly 3,700 litres of water – about the amount of water a person drinks over 3.5 years, or, if you are anything like me, 10-ish years – to make a single pair of jeans. This is because manufacturing and dying conventional cotton requires huge amounts of water. In an effort to reduce these numbers, a slew of brands have been looking into various different denim alternatives including nettle denim and hemp denim. Pangaia’s nettle denim is created by blending wild Himalayan nettle and organic cotton. Grown wild in the Himalayan mountain forests, this nettle plant is not only a naturally regenerative resource but its harvest helps support local communities by providing off-season work for farmers. Hemp is another plant brands are turning to as a cotton alternative. Hemp is four times stronger than cotton, yields three times more fibre than cotton per acre, and consumes only around one-tenth of the water conventional cotton does. With numbers like those, it’s not hard to see why brands are turning to the fabric. As well as being a staple for Pangaia, Weekday recently dropped a hemp denim collection in partnership with Agraloop, a company that transforms food crop waste into new fibres.

ROSE STEMS If you’ve ever envied Barbie Ferreira or Tommy Dorfman in a Collina Strada ensemble then you most likely will have already seen rose sylk, even if you weren’t conscious of it at the time. A favourite staple of the label, rose sylk takes rose stems, petals, and other natural waste from rose bushes and turns it into an biodegradable cellulose fibre. It’s a great plant-based alternative to silk, offering similar smoothness and lustre. Committed to sustainability, Collina Strada also uses upcycled deadstock from the Kantamonto market in Ghana and ​​discarded clothing sent from the US, and donates to the OR Foundation, an organization that plans to build a factory for converting Ghana’s textile waste into coat and home insulation.

PINEAPPLE LEATHER ICYMI, over the summer Nike released a collection in collaboration with Ananas Anam that reimagined several of the brand’s signature styles using Piñatex, a pineapple-based alternative to leather. A byproduct of pineapple harvesting, Piñatex is made from agricultural pineapple waste, including the plant fibres in the leaves and stalks. It was created by Dr Carmen Hijosa, who first developed the idea while she was working as a leather goods consultant in the 1990s and witnessed the catastrophic environmental impact of mass leather production. By using the waste of pineapple harvesting, Piñatex has saved 825 tons of leaves from being burned, in turn preventing 264 CO2 eq tons from being released into the atmosphere. Since it was commercialised in 2016, Piñatex has been used by hundreds of brands including Hugo Boss, H&M, and, of course, Nike.

ORANGE PEEL Like pineapple leather, Orange Fibre is a fabric that makes use of fruity byproducts, in this instance citrus juice. A sustainable silk-like fabric, Orange Fibre is produced by extracting citrus cellulose from the peels, which is then spun into yarn, and was created by two Sicilian students, Adriana Santanocito and Enrica Arenaby, in response to the more than 700,000 tonnes of orange peel that goes to waste every year in Italy. In 2015, Orange Fibre won the H&M Global Change Award and it has since been used by the company in its annual Conscious Exclusive collection, as well as Salvatore Ferragamo, who launched a capsule collection that utilised the fibre in 2017.

GRAPES Helping you feel less guilty about your vino consumption is another plant-based leather alternative, Vegea. Italian company Vegea uses the seeds, skins, and stalks of grapes that would have been otherwise discarded during the wine-making process thus giving it its nickname, wine leather. A bio-oil is extracted from the seeds that is then polymerised using an innovative patented process. At the end of its lifecycle, the fabric can be recycled to produce more wine leather. Brands including H&M and & Other Stories have used Vegea for boots and clutches, and the fabric was also seen on Marni’s AW20 runway. In a similar vein, apple leather takes the cores and skins discarded from the industrial food industry and turns them into a flexible, leathery sheet that is then combined with Polyurethane to create the vegan leather.",,[],[]
Techtextil 2022 Exhibitor Preview: Jowat,"DETMOLD, Germany — May 10, 2022 — Environment-friendly materials and maximum process sustainability are of crucial significance in the textile industry. This trend is supported by Jowat with products from its Green Adhesives series which are sustainable and powerful at the same time and which will take center stage at the adhesive manufacturer’s booth at Techtextil this year.

Resource-saving adhesives with a certified bio-based content are an optimum choice for companies that are pursuing a sustainable reduction in their use of fossil-based raw materials. Jowatherm-Reaktant® GROW 631.20 is the first bio-based reactive PUR hot melt adhesive available for the lamination of materials in the textile and automotive industry. The product has been certified “DIN-geprüft biobased” and “Green Leaf by Intertek” and has a bio-based raw material content of more than 20 percent. Its performance characteristics are equal to the tried and trusted conventional products of the Jowat portfolio: The bio-based adhesive is manufactured at the enterprise’s headquarters in Detmold and meets high requirements concerning its wash resistance and textile feel, and provides a flexible application temperature range between 110°C and 140°C. Changeovers are very easy, it can be integrated in existing application processes.

Increased protection of employees in production is another hallmark of sustainable and responsible enterprises. Since the early 2000s, Jowat has therefore been developing PUR hot melt adhesives which are not subject to hazard labeling requirements. The resulting product group Jowatherm-Reaktant® MR supplies different reactive PUR hot melt adhesives with hazard-free labeling which are already being used successfully in a wide range of applications. Jowatherm-Reaktant® MR 630.99 now also provides a hazard-free alternative for the textile industry. Due to a free monomer isocyanate content of less than 0.1 percent, the hot melt adhesive is not subject to hazard labeling and does therefore not require compulsory training starting from 2023. On the performance side, the adhesive impresses with a broad spectrum of adhesion, good initial strength and a low processing temperature from 100°C to 130°C. It can be processed using established production machines with gravure roller or slot nozzle applicators.

The two Green Adhesives have a wide field of applications ranging from mattress and pillow case production to the manufacture of building textiles, abrasive materials, cleaning textiles and to all textile lamination operations in the automotive industry. Both adhesives of course meet the requirements under “ECO-PASSPORT by OEKO-TEX®” for the manufacturing of certified products in accordance with “Standard 100 by OEKO-TEX®.”

Enhanced knits from Acatel,"Acatel, an advanced vertical finishing mill headquartered in Barcelos, Portugal, has partnered with Fibretrace and Good Earth Cotton to launch a collection of carbon positive and traceable fabrics made with bio-based finishing processes.

The partnership enables Acatel, which provides the global fashion industry with sustainable, low impact knitted fabrics for garment dyeing, printing and finishing, to provide added value to its customers by combining fully traceability and carbon positive fibres with its sustainable finishing approach.

The new Acatel collection debuts two biodegradable finishing products – Eco-Print is the first compostable pigment printing system with Cradle to Cradle Platinum certification, made from a water-based printing paste and compostable colours, while the Good Earth Cotton knit uses a bio-based finishing process made from 85% vegetable ingredients.

Good Earth Cotton is the world’s first carbon positive cotton which sequesters more carbon than it emits across its entire growth lifecycle in Australia.

The core of FibreTrace technology, meanwhile, is a patented luminescent pigment that is embedded in raw fibres (or optionally at the yarn spinning stage) and is traced, verified and audited in real time at each step of the global textile supply chain. This is achieved via a proprietary handheld Bluetooth scanner that identifies and quantifies pigments in fibres, yarns, fabrics and finished goods that send encrypted data into secure blockchain and software that was specifically designed and engineered for the textile and apparel supply chain.

Summit explores material innovators’ scale-up journeys,"Following on from last year’s Sustainable Alternative and Bio-Based Materials summit, which showcased an extensive range of material innovations, this year’s event caught up with some of the start-ups to focus on the challenging journey from concept to commercialisation.

Alternative and bio-based material innovation

Bio-based materials are often categorised by the way they are manufactured, or the type of feedstock utilised. Manufacture can include the adaption of existing processes and technologies or requires the development of an entirely new process. In terms of raw material inputs, we have seen a significant expansion of feedstock types, ranging from algae and plant-based fibres, mycelium, microbe-derived materials and cultivated animal cells to regenerated and recycled waste materials.

During their panel on the limits of bio-material innovation and emerging developments, Shahriare Mahmood, Chief Sustainability Officer at Spinnova and Aaron Nesser, Co-Founder and CEO at AlgiKnit agreed that the word bio-based is not that suitable for describing the vast variety of materials placed under this umbrella term. Therefore, it is important for industry to create clearer definitions, so that these materials can be compared and measured for performance and environmental aspects going forward.

Charlotte Borst, Innovation Associate at Fashion for Good, reiterated the need to develop industry’s understanding of bio-based materials including bio-synthetics and points to Biofabricate and Fashion for Good’s joint report ‘Understanding Biomaterial Innovations: a primer for the fashion industry’ for clarification.

Mahmood reminded the audience those materials described as bio-based are not necessarily biodegradable and while Spinnova’s wood-based cellulose fibres can be 3rd party certified for biodegration, the company prefers to reuse and remake them into new materials. The Spinnova fibre production process can be used for multiple types of renewable raw material streams and the company is working with partners to recycle materials, such as agricultural, textile and leather waste. One example is the company’s collaboration with shoe brand ECCO’s leather partner KT Trading to create a new circular textile made from leather waste. This new textile possesses the natural durability expected from leather, while handling like a lightweight and traditional textile.

Natural Fiber Welding are known for their disruptive welding technology, capable of moulding plant-based fibres into materials that can compete with synthetics. The company employ a highly customisable ecosystem of natural materials to manufacture bespoke and circular materials for their customers. These include ingredients such as charcoal, cork, soybeans and natural rubber to provide a custom formulation of their leather-like material MIRUM to accessory company Bellroy. Natural Fiber Welding’s collaboration with Ralph Lauren produced highly breathable, quick-drying and high absorbency cotton apparel, made from their signature material CLARUS, which utilises a yarn made from 50% recycled and 50% organic virgin cotton.

Like Natural Fiber Welding, who are committed to developing alternatives for fossil fuel-based performance fabrics in order to address microplastic pollution, a number of material innovators cite microplastic and microfibre shedding as a key inspiration in their work. However, much like the confusion around the word bio-based, industry needs to align on the understanding and use of current terminology to strategically develop solutions. Microfibre and microplastic shedding are often used synonymously but a differentiation should be made in line with fragment size and fibre type, while the general assumption that all natural or bio-based fibres will biodegrade harmlessly and fossil fuel-based fibres won’t, is not always accurate.

Nesser shared his personal story about wanting to be part of the solution to plastic pollution and explained that material start-ups should think of Earth as their client to make environmental challenges part of the innovation process. He believes that designers have a superpower, which he refers to as ‘Earth positive design’.

Inspired by his passion for surfing and polymer science, Kintra Fibers Co-founder and CEO Billy McCall decided to apply his knowledge to address microfibre pollution through material innovation, resulting in the development of a biodegradable and compostable, bio-based polyester called polybutylene succinate (PBS), which is currently derived from corn and wheat-derived sugar.

While many material companies believe in addressing microfibre or microplastic pollution by creating biodegradable materials, more research is needed to investigate how any type of fibre shedding, natural or synthetic, affects human and environmental health. While potentially biodegradable in ocean conditions, even carefully developed bio-based fibres need to be considered in the context of colouration, finishing and other manufacturing processes, as these could make the fibres harmful to human or environmental health. When asked how to control what kind of dyes, treatments and finishes end up on Kintra yarns and materials, McCall clarified that the company accepts full responsibility to make sure their products are treated ‘right’. This involves selecting dye-house partners carefully, focussing on green chemistry providers and keeping up with the latest developments.

Accelerating material scalability

As outlined by many speakers, material scalability depends on a wide range of factors, including speed of materials technology adoption, understanding consumers’ needs and strategic partnerships and collaborations.

As Nesser explained, the timescale from lab to commercial product depends on the type of innovation. If the material can be manufactured with existing tools, as a so-called ‘drop-in’ technology, scaling-up and commercialisation will be faster than for products that require new tool and technology innovation to produce the material and following successful development, the material itself.

As Algiknit’s process is a drop-in for existing wet spinning technologies, the company are able to speed up its path to commercialisation and have recently announced a new facility, which houses the company’s R&D, manufacturing and business development teams under one roof. From here they will be working on a significant number of pilot projects and will be launching five targeted products in 2022.

For McCall, utilising drop-in equipment is a strategic choice to de-risk and accelerate the company’s entrance to the market. As Kintra is made on existing polyester equipment the company can work with traditional material producers and is currently partnering with Pangaia to scale-up their process for the use in clothing.

MycoTEX is a seamless manufacturing method, which produces custom-made clothes from compostable mushroom roots and founder Aniela Hoitink explained that by working closely with machine manufacturers to integrate the zero-waste manufacturing method into existing production lines, the journey to commercialisation can be more efficient. To accelerate market launch, Hoitink has also undertaken extensive consumer research to understand consumer needs and preferences, both in terms of material aesthetics and demand for sustainability.

Various speakers mentioned that consumers are becoming more critical about what they wear and sometimes their expectations of new, sustainable materials are difficult to meet. Dr Raquel Prado, Head of Research and Sustainability at Ananas Anam pointed out that consumers as well as brands are often looking for something new but want this to feel and look the same as traditional materials. Therefore, she believes that industry needs to embrace more unique and different aesthetics, rather than striving to mimic leather.

In contrast, VitroLabs Inc, who develop lab-grown leather through tissue engineering, believe they can grow animal hides with the same beauty, feel and quality of traditional leather but with the added bonus of eliminating harm to animals and reducing material waste and chemicals.

Strategic partnerships are critical to the scaling-up and commercialisation process and the event demonstrated how different start-ups have utilised various types of collaborations to bring their material technology to the market. Natural Fiber Welding shared what they refer to as ‘Partner Clouds’, a purpose-driven map, which enables the company to build brand momentum through working with disruptors and sustainability leaders, as well as developing high volume in relevant markets including accessories, footwear, clothing, home and automotive interiors.

Spinnova’s journey started with the discovery of a spider-web inspired fibre in 2009 and the company completed their industrial scale pilot in 2018, followed by the scale-up and commercialisation stage in 2021. The company advanced this process through strategic product development collaborations with brands during the pilot phase, as well as partnerships to drive future commercial volumes. In addition, adidas and ECCO are shareholders following the investment in the company’s IPO.

Inspired by the utilisation of by-products from the citrus processing industry, Italian material start-up Orange Fiber was established in 2014. The company have since collaborated with Ferragamo and H & M and have recently joined forces with the Lenzing Group to create the first ever TENCEL branded Lyocell fibre made of orange and wood pulp. Enrica Arena, Co-Founder at Orange Fiber commented that brand expectations can be obstacles to scaling-up, as requirements for certification, small quantities, short-term agreements and the time and effort required for trials and piloting can make it hard for small start-ups to survive.

Looking at future solutions to support start-ups on their journey, various partnership models are emerging, and these include consortia, such as the ‘Renewable Carbon Textile project’ orchestrated by Fashion for Good. This project brings together material and technology innovators with partners from the entire supply chain to investigate, test and validate the development of biosynthetic alternatives to fossil-fuel based fibres.",,[],[]
