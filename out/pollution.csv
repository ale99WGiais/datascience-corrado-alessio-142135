"A 'lifetime of burden': Older Black adults die from air pollution three times the rate of white adults, study finds","A 'lifetime of burden': Older Black adults die from air pollution three times the rate of white adults, study finds A new study 'shines a light on the cumulative impact of historic discriminatory policies,' that disproportionally impact communities of color.

Older Black adults are three times more likely to die of air pollution than older white adults, according to a new study.

The findings are part of a data analysis released this month by Industrial Economics, a consulting group commissioned by the Environmental Defense Fund.

Researchers analyzed Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. census data, health and mortality statistics of Medicare recipients, as well as findings from peer-reviewed studies on older adults’ exposure to air pollutants, to determine who is most at risk and by how much.

They found rates among people of color disproportionate to their share of the U.S. elder population, 65 and older. Experts said the findings underscore the inequitable, life-threatening effects of air pollution and industry placement, as well as disproportionate, widely documented long-term public health dangers of pollutants.

“This shines a light on the cumulative impact of historic discriminatory policies where a lot of large African American (or) Black populations live,” said EDF senior health scientist Ananya Roy, a professor of urban planning, social welfare and geography at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Researchers specifically studied fine particulate matter – pollutants 2.5 micrometers in size – that can be inhaled and penetrate the lungs and blood. These airborne pollutants are a complex mixture of tiny particles that can be made up of carbon, dust, acids and metals.

About 670 per 100,000 older Black people died of air-pollution-related health conditions, a rate threefold that of white Americans, according to the analysis. The rate for white Americans was 210, per 100,000; older Hispanic adults had a death rate of 260; Native Americans' death rate was 200. In general, people in poverty have a 30% higher risk of death.

Black older adults made up a quarter of roughly 110,000 deaths tied to air pollution in 2015. “The burden borne by Black Americans per capita is really, really disproportionate,” said Roy, who directs UCLA's Luskin Institute on Inequality and Democracy.

Elders are vulnerable to disease. Adding environmental health risks from historic neglect, exposure to pollutants and a lack of health resources, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, creates a storm of concern, said Arianne Teherani, a University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine professor.

“There is this hugely big climate gap,” Teherani said. “Environmental exposures have traditionally not received a lot of recognition and a lot of funding. And that has been an ongoing issue for decades.”

Public health experts have long known that air pollution is associated with health conditions, including cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, and that communities of color face disproportionate exposure. Redlining, polluting industries and resulting unequal climate burdens are to blame, they said.

The EPA’s national air quality standard for fine particulate matter is 12 micrograms per cubic meter. The agency is reviewing the standard and is likely to propose an update this summer. The study estimated that lowering the standard to 10 micrograms would prevent 4,800 deaths, and a standard of 8 micrograms would prevent more than 19,000 deaths.

“The results of this study really show a lifetime of burden and a lifetime of disproportionate exposure that ends in an untimely death,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. “To me, this report is a little bit of a clarion call and saying, ‘Hey, we can't continue to ignore this important sub-population.’”

Hernandez thought of her own sick relatives in the South Bronx of New York City. She grew up in Mott Haven beside a highway and has family who still live there.

“Thinking about these air pollution exposures – what does that mean for my own mother's lifespan? And nobody wants to think about that,” she said. It's ""really systemic, because I know that there are some people that never have to contend with those with those considerations.”

Hernandez said unequal distribution of air quality improvement contributes to community neglect.

“The elderly are neglected as an EJ (environmental justice) population,” she said. The disproportionate elder deaths are a “real warning sign around what lifetimes of burden actually materialize into.”

Most Americans live with unsafe air pollution levels,"More than 92% of Americans live in a region with unsafe air pollution, which could lead to reduced life expectancy, according to the latest University of Chicago Air Quality Life Index.

Why it matters: Some Americans could add more than a year to their lives if they lived in a place with cleaner air.

Air pollution can affect not only the lungs but also the heart, upper airways and many other organs.

What they're saying: ""Don't light things on fire and breathe it into your lungs,"" Erika Moseson, a pulmonologist on the American Thoracic Society Environmental Health Policy Committee, told Axios.

The details: The most polluted counties in the U.S. are in California.

In Mariposa County, which makes up part of Yosemite National Park; residents could gain 1.7 years of life expectancy if air quality there met new WHO standards, researchers concluded.

The big picture: Improving air quality is tantamount to improving health outcomes, and the U.S. still has a long way to go.",,[],"['Arielle Dreher', 'Authors Adreher']"
Utah environmental group warns about summer's invisible pollution,"SALT LAKE CITY — Utah is moving into what is projected to be a hotter and drier summer than usual this year, according to the Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah.

HEAL Utah says the more the climate continues to heat up, the worse the air pollution will become, which will impact the formation of ground-level ozone.

""This is the pollution that we're calling the invisible summertime pollution,"" said Meisei Gonzalez with HEAL Utah.

Gonzalez said in the winter months, the air quality throughout the Wasatch Front regularly gains national and sometimes worldwide recognition. He said this is due to Utah's geography and the high emitting pollution through the valley.

While that type of pollution is very visual, Gonzalez says the summertime ozone pollution tends to fly under people's radar a little bit.

According to HEAL Utah's website, the formation of the pollution is directly tied to sunlight, where it peaks in the hours of 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.

Gonzalez touched on two other main contributors to this type of pollution.

Just like in the winter, he said vehicle exhausts and emissions are a factor. It's something he says is driven by the fact that the population here in Utah is continuing to grow.

The other is our buildings, he said.

""Buildings are as — I want to say — disposable as cars,"" Gonzalez said. ""We kind of [go] through cars through our lives, where buildings, we kind of stay with them for quite a while, and a lot of these buildings end up emitting a lot of emissions just due to being out of date.""

During a presentation earlier this month by Utah's Division of Air Quality during the Clean Air Caucus, some of the pollution was attributed to the fact that 90 percent of the Beehive State's population lives on 1.1 percent of the land.

The presentation went into detail about how bad the pollution was in 2021, from June through September.

""We look at last year in particular, you can see for both ozone and particulate matter, we had many days that were not only over the standard, but in some cases double the federal air quality standard,"" said Bryce Bird, the director of the Division of Air Quality.

It's something Gonzalez said is having a wide-reaching impact.

""A lot of these numbers are showing that air pollution is shortening the lives of a lot of Utahns, and it's actually even becoming a reason why people are moving out of our state,"" he said.

HEAL Utah points to several ways to cut down on this kind of summer pollution. They include carpooling when possible, using public transportation, and finding ways to ride a bike or walk more often.

Gonzalez said HEAL Utah recently received a $200,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency under its Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program to extend an air quality mapping program in Salt Lake County to include an environmental justice element.

Gonzalez said the grant will be put toward a study with a scientist at the University of Utah to put some air quality monitors on buses.

The hope, he says, is to compare results from different communities and how pollution is affecting them.",,[],['Chris Arnold']
Severe storms in Houston: Is air pollution to blame?,"Scientists from across the country are in Houston this summer to study whether tiny particles like soot and dust are making storms more intense.

Listen

At the La Porte airport, an empty field has been turned into a science lab. More than a dozen shipping containers are clumped together housing high-tech gear, many with antennas and other devices protruding from their tops. A giant cloud radar system sits on top of several of the trailers, and a sonic detection device emits a beeping noise in the background as it gathers data.

It’s a sunny day with just a few puffy, white clouds in an otherwise clear blue sky.

For Heath Powers with the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement team in New Mexico, it's a bit boring.

""We're not going to have thunderstorms today,"" he said. ""We want to see big puffy white clouds grow up and get bigger and taller and more ominous and ultimately produce rain and thunderstorms. And that’s really cool to capture.""

Powers is one of dozens of researchers from around the country who will be in Houston this summer to see whether aerosols – tiny specks of soot, dust, smoke and other particles – are impacting the severity of thunderstorms.

Understanding the connection between pollution and severe storms could ultimately help improve weather forecasting and help cities better prepare for extreme weather and flash floods, according to the researchers.

""Just understanding how those conditions impact the strength of storms, can have influences on the precipitation and then subsequent flooding and safety issues. So those improved weather forecasts are one important part,"" said Michael Jensen, a meteorologist with the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory and the lead scientist on the project.

Beyond day-to-day weather, researchers also aim to improve models used for air quality and climate predictions.

Several scientific studies have suggested that by changing the makeup of cloud and precipitation particles, aerosols can make storms stronger, larger, and bring more rainfall.

These tiny particles can come from both natural and manmade sources. They include things like soot, dust and smoke. Jensen said Houston was chosen in part because it has a variety of these particles, including sea spray from the Gulf.

""There’s obviously lots of aerosols associated with industry and refineries and transportation – all the things that come with a big urban center like this,"" he said.

The study started in October, and it entered an intensive phase for the summer storm season on June 1.

So far, Jensen said they've been surprised by just how many different types of particles are in the Houston area, including from forest fires in New Mexico.

""We’re able to look at some of the details of the composition and the size of those aerosol particles, and then use models to try to understand where those came from,” he said. “And that’s been pretty eye-opening.”

The equipment — which includes various types of radars, lidars and other tools — gathers an array of data on cloud properties, such as height, distribution, depth and the amount of water inside.

In addition to La Porte, measurements are also taken in Fort Bend County in the city of Guy. The team will also launch more than a thousand weather balloons throughout the course of the study to gather additional data on temperature, humidity and wind speed.

""What’s exciting for us is the sheer mass of instrumentation that’s here,"" said James Flynn, an atmospheric scientist with the University of Houston.

Flynn said he's been involved in air quality studies here for decades. But this is the first time it's been so weather-focused.

""Once we bring all of the data together, it’s going to be a pretty powerful dataset to look at,"" Flynn said.

Scientists warn of new ocean pollution threat called ‘plastitar’,"SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) - Scientists are worried two forms of ocean pollution are joining together to form a sort of super pollution.

Some of them are sounding the alarm now to try to stop the problem from getting worse.

For years, environmental groups have warned of the dangers from microplastics reaching San Francisco Bay.

Microscopic fragments often break off from the kinds of plastic trash found washing up on beaches.

Peter Roopnarine with the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco said taken together, plastics and microplastics present a significant threat to marine life and the coastal environment.

“We’re finding them everywhere. We’re finding them in high concentrations in the open ocean,” Roopnarine said.

But now, researchers believe plastics are combining with a second substance, oil, to create a different form of pollution.

In a small study, a team on the Canary Islands documented dangerous microplastics embedded in oily tar balls created from spills or oil leaking from ships or pipelines.

It’s a combination being dubbed “plastitar.”

Roopnarine said the micro spills are common around the world.

“So anything that any process that can aggregate these small particles, which we know dense petroleum can, is going to aggregate microplastics,” Roopnarine said.

One concern is that once the fragments are embedded on a beach or coastline, they could degrade even further, finding their way into the food chain and marine environment.

“So we have a lot of ships coming and going. And they’re coming and going through some of the most biodiverse waters in the world,” Jennifer Stack said. “So we are always looking to how to best take care of these waters to prevent oil spills from happening.”

Stack is with the Greater Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries. The group organizes volunteers who routinely monitor the Bay Area coastline for signs of spilled oil that could threaten wildlife.

So far, researchers say it’s unclear if the “plastitar” phenomenon is limited to the Canary Islands or how widespread it may be.

But they said it could be viewed as a red flag for the dual threat to the oceans from microplastics and industrial pollution.

Ending plastic pollution; protecting our blue planet,"Mr. Pascal Canfin, Chair of the ENVI committee,

Honourable Members of the European Parliament,

It is a pleasure to be here with you today.

The triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss and pollution and waste is upon us and bearing down harder every year. If we do not act strongly, this crisis will crush our chances of delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals. We can forget about ending hunger and poverty, delivering peace and equity, and living in harmony with the natural world.

This year, however, the international community has demonstrated the will to act with the force and speed needed to halt the triple planetary crisis. Stockholm+50 showed that the world is ready for system-wide transformations that place human well-being at the centre of a healthy planet. And, a few months earlier, in March, the Nairobi spirit of consensus-based diplomacy delivered high-impact outcomes at the fifth United Nations Environment Assembly, or UNEA 5.2.

The political declaration in Nairobi stressed the urgent need to halt the decline of biodiversity and the fragmentation of habitats – while four resolutions on nature covered issues from biodiversity and health to nature-based solutions. Resolutions on the circular economy reinforced plans to make infrastructure resilient, to push for a greener recovery from COVID-19 and to deal with the environmental aspects of minerals and metals management.

Big strides were made on chemicals, waste and pollution. The resolution to establish a science-policy panel on the sound management of chemicals and waste and preventing pollution could be a game-changer. This panel will give the third prong of the triple planetary crisis a scientific body on a par with those for climate and biodiversity.

And, of course, we had a milestone moment with the adoption of the resolution to create, by 2024, an international legally binding agreement on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment. This resolution is a testament to global coordination, cooperation and meaningful multistakeholder engagement. My appreciation to the European Union for your support in arriving at these positive outcomes.

Friends,

You all know the damage plastic pollution is causing, particularly to the blue planet. And you all know the benefits a comprehensive circular economy approach to plastics would bring – slashing the volume of plastics entering the oceans, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, saving money and creating jobs. So, allow me to drill down on the critical elements that I believe are necessary for the final agreement to be meaningful, impactful and effective – and therefore – be able to stop plastic pollution.

As I see it, at the top level, the deal must be ambitious, well-designed, and inclusive. The deal should include clear, defined, and monitorable targets – against which Member States can measure progress. The deal should recognize that our societies and economies depend on plastics, but that it is a product that should generally not be for single-use. The deal needs to be inclusive and address the concerns of all countries and those that work within the plastics economy.

But let us talk specifics. Here are my five key recommendations.

One, build a broad instrument that does not just tinker around the edges.

The deal must cover the full life cycle of plastics use. Consider different types of polymers and plastic products. Prioritize sustainable consumption and production, including the uptake of secondary and alternative raw materials. Deploy innovative reuse models. Design products that keep the highest value when recycling plastic. Address the chemical contents in the plastics we use to enable safe reuse and recycling. Develop safe and environmentally sound waste management. Eliminate residual waste along the value chain.

We aren’t exactly reinventing the wheel, but we do need to ensure that the plastics industry rolls in the right direction. And that means a radical transformation.

Two, be informed by science.

The deal must rely on science to identify hotspots for action along the value chain – looking at the most impactful polymers, products, sectors, geographic locations and waste systems.

Science has laid out the full scale of plastic pollution problem. It must be our guide as we fix the problem.

Three, bring everybody under the action umbrella.

The deal must account for the realities and complexities of the market – hear and understand the voices of plastic-dependent industries and grassroots communities, including waste pickers and others. In this regard, I was pleased to see that multi-stakeholder dialogues were part and parcel of the adhoc Open Ended Working Group discussions to end plastic pollution which was held last month in Dakar, Senegal. We will need governments, the private sector, research and development communities, indigenous peoples, the informal sector, youth, civil society organizations and consumer-based organizations.

We will need everyone to land and implement the deal.

Four, spur solutions for a new economy.

It is important to remember that this is not just about ending an environmental threat. It is about creating new economic opportunities and alleviating poverty. We are talking about new business models, new jobs. New market opportunities for recycling. New and alternative designs, materials, and products. Social and policy innovation to nudge behaviour changes in actions of different stakeholders along the plastics life cycle.

Let’s view this as creating a new economy, not destroying an old one.

Five, learn from other multilateral agreements and instruments, but embrace innovations in the multilateral environmental space.

We can learn much from, and build upon, existing instruments – from the Montreal Protocol to the Basel, Rotterdam, Stockholm and Minamata Conventions. But we should also innovate. We can find new pathways for modern, inclusive and networked multilateralism to give a broader set of stakeholders a voice – and give industry a chance to commit and measure themselves or be measured against agreed targets.

We need something old, something new, something borrowed to protect the blue i.e. the oceans on which we all depend.

Friends, we have two years to get this deal agreed and running, but the process is already in motion.

At the open-ended working group in Dakar, progress was made on nominating bureau members for regions, and the first of five planned sessions of the International Negotiating Committee is to be held in Uruguay, tentatively in November. The support of the European Union will be crucial – both politically and in terms of action to combat plastic pollution until the deal is up-and-running.

We are living through difficult times. But what I have seen this year – in terms of UNEA, in terms of the progress on plastic pollution, in terms of the growing societal movement for a healthy environment – reassures me that we can turn things around.

The European Union, and you on the ENVI Committee, have played an integral part in these signs of hope. My thanks for your efforts so far. Now I urge you to keep up the momentum.

It is crucial that the European Union maintains high ambition on the triple planetary crisis, in the interests of not only European citizens, but the rest of the planet. I ask members of the European Parliament, through ongoing discussions on elements of the Fit for 55 package, to take the right decisions for planet and people, based on science.

I look forward to working with you to shift the needle even further into the green.",,[],[]
Air pollution in fast-growing African cities presents a risk of premature death,"Biomass burning dominated Africa’s air-pollution cause-list for centuries; this is now changing, at least in cities

Ten more African cities have signed on to the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration to improve air quality. C40 is an international group of mayors collaborating to make cities more environmentally sustainable.

In May 2022, Abidjan, Accra, Addis Ababa, Dakar, Ekurhuleni, Freetown, Johannesburg, Lagos, Nairobi and Tshwane joined Durban, the first African city to sign the declaration.

As part of the C40 pledge, city leaders have committed to actions to tackle air pollution and slow human-caused changes in climate. These include actions such as setting targets that follow the World Health Organisation’s clean air guidelines.

This is a welcome commitment, as air pollution is a leading burden on global health. More than 6.5 million people die prematurely from exposure to air pollution each year worldwide. And air quality is worsening in African cities during a period of rapid growth and development. African cities are forecast to grow by 3-31 per cent annually from now until the end of the century. This is far steeper than growth rates in Indian cities, at about 1-3 per cent per year.

A major challenge in combating air pollution in Africa’s cities is the scarcity of data. Air quality is not monitored in most cities and resources to compile inventories of the types and sizes of sources contributing to air pollution are lacking. All these efforts are costly and require sustained, long-term funding.

Publicly available data from satellite observations provide a picture of multiple air pollutants. In our recent study, we sampled these data over fast-growing cities in the tropics, including 26 in Africa. Our investigation covered a 14-year period between 2005 and 2018.

We determined that the quality of air is declining at unprecedented rates. We found that the cause is a shift from rural to urban sources and that combined worsening air quality and population growth is linked to 180,000 additional premature deaths.

Such harmful effects will persist without bold air quality policies.

Shift in pollution

For centuries, air pollution in Africa has been dominated by open burning of biomass. This is a common practice by farmers in the dry season to clear land and to prepare for the next sowing season. The smoke produced is full of pollutants, bad for people and the environment.

This is now changing, in cities at least.

In our analysis we identified that urban pollution sources have surpassed rural biomass burning as the main cause for worsening air pollution in cities. Satellite observations are too coarse (~10 kilometres) to pinpoint the exact sources, but we can speculate that these include road traffic, burning of waste, and household use of fuels like charcoal and wood.

Our study focused on the fastest growing cities in the tropics. Amongst these are Lagos (population 15.4 million people growing at 3.5 per cent per year) in Nigeria, Dar es Salaam (population 7.4 million people, 5.1 per cent per year) in Tanzania, and Kinshasa (population 15.6 million people, 4.4 per cent per year) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The air quality indicators we tracked were fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) and the gas-phase compounds nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ammonia (NH3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These either directly impact health (PM2.5, NO2) or form air pollutants that do (VOCs, NH3). These can all be produced from traffic, and burning of household waste and fuel.

Health hazards

The shift from rural to urban sources, combined with rapid population growth, is leading to more people living in closer proximity to air pollution and worsening population health.

Of most concern is PM2.5, as these particles are about 30 times smaller than the diameter of a strand of human hair. PM2.5 penetrate deep into our lungs and go on to have a range of effects on health, leading to premature death. Most prominent are heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and lower respiratory infections.

We used health risk assessment and atmospheric chemistry models, along with the satellite data, to estimate that premature mortality from sustained exposure to these small particles has steadily increased in 21 of the fastest growing cities in Africa. It’s risen from 84,000 in 2005 to 110,000 in 2018. This is on average about 2,000 avoidable deaths each year.

Karn Vohra

A third of these deaths are in five of the 10 cities that have signed on to the C40 declaration: Abidjan, Addis Ababa, Dakar, Lagos and Nairobi. The steepest increase in early deaths of about 300 people per year is in Kinshasa, a city yet to join the pledge.

The number of people dying prematurely from exposure to air pollution is three times lower in African cities than in Asia, where the shift to urban sources of air pollution is well under way or has already occurred. This is in part because improvements in healthcare in Africa are counteracting the adverse effects of air pollution on health leading to decline in overall mortality. In Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, for example, the number of deaths could have been almost double the values we estimated without improvements in healthcare. But this offsetting won’t last if air quality continues to degrade and healthcare improvements taper off.

Twenty-six cities in Africa are predicted to be megacities by 2100, reaching unprecedented sizes. By 2100, Lagos may be home to 80 million people; more than double the current largest city of Tokyo.

Access to emission control and renewable energy technologies are cheaper and easier to use than ever before. The C40 pledges are a step in the right direction, but more cities need to join to safeguard public health across the continent.

Spider webs record severity of microplastic pollution in cities,"Spider webs are a good barometer of the amount of microplastics in city air, according to a new study out of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. Although previous research has shown that pollutants like heavy metals and magnetic particles can become trapped in spider webs, nobody has examined these natural structures for microplastics until now, explained geochemist Barbara Scholz-Böttcher, who headed the study.

The University of Oldenburg team collected spider webs from the upper area of semi-covered bus stops located along roads with varying traffic levels in the north-western German city of Oldenburg. The goal was to determine whether microplastics could be detected and if certain distribution patterns could be identified. The researchers identified fibres, presumably from textiles, as well as soot particles.

These samples were heated at very high temperatures in the absence of oxygen, and the resulting plastic fragments were identified using GC–MS. The team found that all the spider webs they had collected were contaminated with microplastics, and in some cases the plastic content even accounted for a tenth of the total weight of a web. Almost 90% of the plastic detected consisted of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and material from car tyres. The proportion of tyre debris in the webs varied greatly, depending on the traffic on the adjacent road. It also appeared that the abrasion of road markings contributed significantly to microplastic load along roads.

The team concluded that examining spider webs is a fast and inexpensive biomonitoring approach that can be used to screen for hot spots of microplastics pollution that require further detailed human health and ecological risk assessment.",,[],['Rebecca Trager']
Minnesota climate goals jeopardized by stubborn tailpipe pollution,"Even after passing clean car rules last year, Minnesota lags in cleaning up carbon pollution from vehicle tailpipes, according to a state plan to reduce greenhouse gases.

Transportation, led by cars, trucks and SUVs, is the single biggest contributor to the heat-trapping pollution produced in Minnesota. The problem looms large over a Thursday discussion by a group of advocates, researchers and government officials to revise Minnesota's Climate Action Framework.

The framework, still in draft form, calls for transformations in how communities are planned, how land is farmed and how electricity is generated. The plan aims to reduce carbon emissions and make the state more resilient to a hotter and wetter climate.

Some suggested changes — proposed by work groups reviewing the plan — could lead to even more stringent goals, like phasing out the use of fossil fuels entirely in the state.

But one of the thorniest parts of the framework is how to move people between home, work and leisure without the pollution that comes from those fuels.

The framework calls for a 30% reduction in greenhouse gases in transportation by 2025 and 80% by 2050, in line with a 2007 state law. But the plan notes that reductions in emissions in the transportation sector have stalled for the past six years.

Along with electricity generation, transportation needs to be a main focus because ""we already have the technology,"" said Peter Wagenius, legislative director for the North Star Chapter of Sierra Club.

""Investing in electric vehicle charging, investing in bus rapid transit, those should be the priorities,"" Wagenius said.

The main effort so far by Gov. Tim Walz's administration to reduce vehicle pollution has been controversial. Last year, Walz succeeded in passing clean car rules, though they won't go into effect until 2024 and the political fight over them led to the resignation of his top pollution regulator.

The rules mandate that more electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are delivered to the state, but auto dealers have pushed back, filing a legal challenge in the state Court of Appeals last week.

Also included in the framework is an intention to ""increase the use of clean fuels, including lower-carbon biofuels.""

Brian Kletscher, the president of the industry group Minnesota Bio-Fuels Association, said that fuels like corn-based ethanol have to be included in future energy plans. He argued that new technology will reduce the carbon footprint of these fuels in the future.

""If we think we can get by without an all-of-the-above solution, we're fooling ourselves,"" Kletscher said.

On this point, there's significant disagreement. The group reviewing the transportation section of the plan suggested that biofuels should be used only where electrification is less feasible, like for heavy-duty vehicles. They also noted that some members felt these fuels could be used in existing vehicles and that ""electrification should not be the only answer.""

Wagenius, who is part of the transportation work group for the plan, said relying on these fuels was a misguided solution.

""Frankly, the Walz administration is out of date, and the climate plan should be an opportunity to let go of old ideas,"" Wagenius said, including a reliance on ethanol.

He also criticized the 80% emissions reduction goal for 2050 and said the state should aim to eliminate emissions entirely by then.

Darin Broton, a spokesman for the MPCA, acknowledged in a statement that the state isn't on track for the 80% reduction. He also wrote that ""Ethanol is less carbon-intensive than gasoline and biofuels production technology continues to evolve.""

At the same time, the state also has very little time to meet its 2025 goals. Broton acknowledged that Minnesota is not on track to hit that target, either.

Jessica Hellmann, a professor and director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota, said that lofty goals are meant to inspire change. Any action to reduce carbon pollution is a good one, she said, even if it's not meeting targets.

But Hellmann added that the state's framework needs more specificity on what the state will actually do to get there, and what needs to happen first.

""You cannot take action without plans, but there's a point at which planning is insufficient to leading to the change we need to see at the pace we need to see it,"" she said. ""Planning might not send a strong enough signal to the businesses and the industry.""

The climate framework is planned to be completed by this summer.",,[],"['Chloe Johnson', 'Chloe.Johnson Startribune.Com']"
Air pollution exposure disparities in US public housing developments,"Fine particulate air pollution data

For assessing exposure to fine particulate air pollution, we use estimates of outdoor PM 2.5 concentrations developed by the Center for Air, Climate and Energy Solutions (CACES), using national-scale empirical models as described in Kim et al.25. These models are based on publicly available concentration measurements from EPA regulatory monitors, and combine land use information and satellite-derived estimates of air pollution to predict concentrations for criteria air pollutants at multiple spatial scales, including census tracts and block groups. Census tracts are relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a US county that generally encompass between 1500 and 8000 people, with an optimum size of 4000 people48. Tracts are designed to be fairly homogeneous with respect to the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the local population when they are first established. A census block group is a subdivision of a census tract that generally contains between 600 and 3000 people, with an optimum size of 1500 people48.

For this study, both census tract and block group level values of predicted PM 2.5 concentrations were downloaded from the CACES Land Use Regression database for 2011 to 2015 (latest years available). While this database also provides ambient concentrations of other air pollutants (carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and PM 10 ), we focused specifically on PM 2.5 because of its well-documented adverse health outcomes1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 and higher exposure levels for socially disadvantaged groups in the US13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21.

For each census tract and block group in the continental US, the five-year average annual PM 2.5 concentration was calculated as the arithmetic mean of five annual concentration values, from 2011 to 2015. This information was used to develop separate dependent variables to address each of our two research objectives. Tract-level mean values of PM 2.5 concentration (2011–2015) were used for the tract-level analysis. For the PHD-level analysis, the average annual PM 2.5 concentration (2011–2015) around each housing development was estimated using values from the block group in which their geographic coordinates were located. Specifically, we utilized a spatial join function in ArcGIS Desktop 10.8.1 software that allocates selected attributes from a target polygon feature (i.e., PM 2.5 concentration from a block group) to all point features located within the boundary of the target polygon (i.e., PHDs located inside or on the block group boundary).

Public housing data

Since the US Housing Act of 1937, the US federal government has provided housing assistance to low-income renters under programs administered by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These HUD programs provide subsidies that reduce rents for lower income tenants who meet specific program eligibility requirements. Generally, households pay rent equaling 30% of their incomes, while the federal government pays the remainder of the rental costs. Public housing, the focus of this study, includes housing developments owned and operated by local Public Housing Authorities for which HUD provides capital and operating assistance49. In 2015, the total number of people residing in PHDs was about 2.24 million—higher than those living in any other type of HUD-assisted multifamily project-based rental housing.

Information on federally subsidized public housing for this study was derived from the online HUD Picture of Subsidized Households26. For each PHD, this database provides locational coordinates, number of occupied and unoccupied units, socio-demographic characteristics of resident households, and other relevant details. Our study was based on project level data for 2015 (compiled by HUD on December 31, 2015), to match our 2011–2015 annual average PM 2.5 concentration values. Using ArcGIS Desktop 10.8.1 software, the locations of 7000 PHDs (buildings) in the continental US were geocoded using latitude–longitude information. It should be noted that PHDs in the HUD database used for this study are depicted as a distinct address that is chosen to represent the general location of an entire PHD. When a PHD comprises multiple buildings, the building with the largest number of units is selected to represent the location of the development.

In the Picture of Subsidized Households database, HUD suppresses data for count variables with values smaller than 11 (coded as − 4) to preserve confidentiality and data for specific variables are not reported (coded as − 5) when reporting rates for the PHD are smaller than 50%. To address suppressed data on the number of units and resident population in 311 of the 7,000 PHDs in the continental US, we substituted a value of 1 to replace values of − 4 and − 5. This is likely to undercount the actual number of units and residents in these 311 PHDs, but provides a conservative non-zero estimate for our census tract-level analysis50.

Variables

The first phase of our study sought to examine whether PHD locations, units, and residents, respectively, are overrepresented in census tracts with greater PM 2.5 exposure, after controlling for spatial clustering and relevant socio-demographic factors. This necessitated the construction of three different independent variables to assess the public housing status of each tract. The first variable indicated the presence or absence of PHDs in the tract, a dichotomous measure coded as either 1 or 0. The second and third variables are continuous and estimate the number of PHD units and residents, respectively, expressed as a percentage of the total number of all housing units and population in each tract from the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates. We excluded tracts with low population (< 500) and housing (< 200) counts to ensure stable proportions for our variables, as well as tracts located in counties without PHDs. This led to the removal of 11,146 (15.4%) of 72,263 tracts in the continental US. The first phase of our analysis thus encompasses a total of 61,117 tracts with at least 500 people and 200 housing units, from the 1,892 counties that contained PHDs in 2015.

To control for tract-level socio-demographic characteristics, we used variables from the 2015 ACS five-year estimates that have been found to be significantly related to PM 2.5 exposure in previous national-scale US studies14,15,17,18,19,21,27 and are comparable to variables available in the HUD dataset on public housing utilized for PHD-level analysis. To examine the effects of ethnicity and race, we included the percentages of individuals who identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino (of any race) and non-Hispanic Black alone—the two largest ethnic/racial minority groups in the US. We combined the percentages of non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native alone, non-Hispanic Asian alone, non-Hispanic Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian alone, non-Hispanic another race, and multiple races into a single category that represents non-Hispanic other non-White (minority) individuals. We excluded the percentage of non-Hispanic White residents from our multivariable models to ensure that results for the minority ethnic/racial groups are interpretable relative to this category. The percentage of people with an annual income below the poverty level was used to represent socioeconomic status. Additional measures of social disadvantage comprised the percentage of people with a disability, those aged 62 or more years, and female-headed households. The disability variable in the ACS encompasses civilian non-institutionalized individuals reporting at least one of these difficulties: hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and independent living. In addition to these socio-demographic characteristics, three control variables were included in our multivariable models. To account for urban–rural differences, we used Rural–Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes developed by the US Department of Agriculture that classify census tracts using measures of population density, urbanization, and daily commuting51. We created two dummy variables to identify tracts located in metropolitan (RUCA codes 1–3) and micropolitan areas (RUCA codes 4–6), respectively. We excluded RUCA codes 7–10 (small towns and rural areas) from our models, making them the interpretive reference for variables representing the metropolitan and micropolitan categories. Since PHDs are classified as multifamily housing, we included the percentage of housing units in the tract that are single-family detached homes to adjust for the prevalence of non-PHD multifamily housing.

The second phase of our study focused on determining if the average PM 2.5 concentration (2011–2015) in census block groups hosting PHDs was greater for PHDs containing higher percentages of socially disadvantaged households. This phase encompasses a total of 6,685 PHDs with at least 11 residents for which detailed socio-demographic data on resident household characteristics were available (no missing data for included variables) in the HUD Picture of Subsidized Households database for December 31, 201513. For ethnic/racial minority status, we included the percentages of households where the head of the household was Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black. Information on the percentage of households belonging to other non-Hispanic minority categories (e.g., non-Hispanic Asian, Native American, and Other Race) were combined into a single variable. Our analysis included three additional indicators of social disadvantage that align closely with the tract-level independent variables used in Phase 1: the percentage of female-headed households, those in which the eldest of the household head or spouse was aged 62 or older, and residents with a disability. To measure socioeconomic status, we used the percentage of extremely low-income households (HUD definition), as described in Table 3. We also used the same set of control variables utilized for our tract-level analysis in the previous phase: metropolitan or micropolitan status of the tract hosting the PHD based on RUCA codes, and percentage of single-family housing units to adjust for the prevalence of non-PHD multifamily housing.

Statistical models

For the first phase of analysis, three multivariable models were constructed to independently examine the association of the presence of PHDs, percentage of PHD units, and percentage of population residing in PHD units, respectively, with average tract-level PM 2.5 concentrations, after controlling for relevant socio-demographic variables and spatial clustering. In the second phase, a single multivariable model was constructed to examine the relationship between average PM 2.5 concentrations in the census block group hosting the PHD and selected socio-demographic characteristics of PHDs, after controlling for a set of variables similar to those used in Phase 1. Our multivariable models for both phases are based on generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with robust (i.e., Huber/White) covariance estimates, which extend the generalized linear model to accommodate clustered data52. GEEs relax several assumptions of traditional regression models and impose no strict distributional assumptions for the variables analyzed (e.g., normality), while accounting for clustering of analytic units. Recent studies indicate that GEEs based on theoretically informed clusters are more advantageous for analyzing social disparities in the distribution of environmental hazards compared to other techniques such as spatial autoregressive models, mixed models with random effects, and multilevel modeling approaches17,50,53. To estimate a GEE model, clusters of observations are defined based on the assumption that observations from within a cluster are correlated, whereas observations from different clusters are independent54. The cluster definition for the tract-level analysis was based on the US county within which the tract is located by median decade of housing construction, which ranged from “2010 or later” to “before 1939”. This definition corresponds to historical–geographical formation of environmental inequalities55 and is consistent with previous national-scale US studies on social disparities in air pollution17,56. This combination of county (1,892) and median decade of housing stock (10) for each tract yielded a total of 7,492 clusters for the tract-level GEEs. Clusters were defined for the PHD-level analysis using the city in which the building was located, since federally subsidized rental housing within a particular city can be expected have to have certain similarities compared to those located elsewhere46. This resulted in a total of 3337 clusters of PHDs in the PHD-level GEE model.

An intra-cluster dependency correlation matrix also needs to be specified for estimating a GEE54. After experimentation with several different specifications, the ‘independent’ correlation matrix was chosen for the three GEEs in Phase 1 and the ‘exchangeable’ correlation matrix was selected for the GEE in Phase 2. We selected these specifications because they yielded the best statistical fit based on the QIC (quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion). To further improve model fit, several different distributions (e.g., normal, gamma, and inverse Gaussian) appropriate for non-zero continuous dependent variables were tested with identity and logarithmic link functions. An identity link function models relationships between the dependent and independent variables linearly, while a log link function represents natural logarithmic relationships. The gamma distribution with identity link function was chosen for all GEEs because this function indicated the best fit based on the QIC.

All independent variables were standardized, and standardized coefficients are provided in tables summarizing the GEE results. Two-tailed p values from the Wald Chi-Square test were used to test the statistical significance of each variable coefficient. Potential multicollinearity among these variables were also examined using the multicollinearity condition index for the combination of all independent variables included in each GEE. This multicollinearity condition index was smaller than 10.0 in all multivariable models, confirming that the GEEs are not affected by multicollinearity. We also tested the residuals from our four GEE models for spatial autocorrelation using a contiguity-based (queen) spatial weights matrix. Non-significant (p > 0.05) values of the Moran’s I statistic indicated that spatial autocorrelation did not affect our statistical model results.",,[],"['Chakraborty', 'Department Of Sociology', 'Anthropology', 'University Of Texas At El Paso', 'El Paso', 'Collins', 'Timothy W.', 'Department Of Geography', 'University Of Utah', 'Salt Lake City']"
Scientists find novel antibiotics in ocean plastic pollution,"5 – 13 million metric tons of trash enter the oceans every year. (Credit: Sergei Tokmakov / Pixabay)

Plastic pollution, ranging from massive floating trash to microplastics on which bacteria can create entire ecosystems, is estimated to enter the oceans between five and 13 million metric tons each year, according to one estimate. There are approximately 12 trillion to 125 trillion bits of microplastics floating in the seas. However, scientists are trying to make lemonade from lemons where they can.

According to a recent student-led study presented at the American Society for Microbiology’s conference in Washington, D.C. on June 9-13, 2022 which has yet to be peer-reviewed, conducted in partnership with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, plastic contamination in the ocean could actually be a source for novel antibiotics.

Plastic waste is high in biomass, making it a suitable candidate for antibiotic synthesis, which occurs naturally in highly competitive ecosystems.

“Considering the current antibiotic crisis and the rise of superbugs, it is essential to look for alternative sources of novel antibiotics,” said study lead author Andrea Price of National University. “We hope to expand this project and further characterize the microbes and the antibiotics they produce.”

The researchers adapted Jo Handelsman’s Tiny Earth citizen science approach, a method to discover antibiotics from soil bacteria, to marine circumstances to investigate the plastisphere’s potential as a source of new antibiotics. For 90 days, the researchers incubated high- and low-density polyethylene plastic (often used in supermarket bags) in water near Scripps Pier in La Jolla, California.

Five antibiotic-producing bacteria, including Bacillus, Phaeobacter, and Vibrio species, were recovered from ocean plastic by the researchers. They examined the bacterial isolates against a number of Gram-positive and negative targets and discovered that they were efficient against both common bacteria and two antibiotic-resistant species.

Plastic waste is gathering in pockets across the Earth’s oceans, such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and even the Arctic Ocean and Antarctica’s icy polar regions are not immune to the global danger of plastic waste.

Researchers have also warned that plastic pollution, which includes everything from huge floating trash to microplastics, could provide enough surface area for bacteria to flourish and build entire ecosystems. They claim that certain of these microbial ecosystems may pose a worldwide health danger by hosting antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

If the antibiotics, do indeed, turn out to be novel and effective, then there might be at least some small sliver of bright lining in the ocean’s plastic problem.",,[],"['If You Love Science', 'This Free App Is All You Need.', 'A Space Nerd', 'Self-Described Grammar Freak', 'All His Twitter Posts Are Complete Sentences', 'He Loves Learning About The Unknown', 'Figures That If He Isn T Smart Enough To Send Satellites To Space', 'He Can At Least Write About It.

Study finds natural sources of air pollution exceed air quality guidelines in many regions,"Alongside climate change, air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health. Tiny particles known as particulate matter or PM2.5 (named for their diameter of just 2.5 micrometers or less) are a particularly hazardous type of pollutant. These particles are produced from a variety of sources, including wildfires and the burning of fossil fuels, and can enter our bloodstream, travel deep into our lungs, and cause respiratory and cardiovascular damage. Exposure to particulate matter is responsible for millions of premature deaths globally every year.

In response to the increasing body of evidence on the detrimental effects of PM2.5, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently updated its air quality guidelines, lowering its recommended annual PM2.5 exposure guideline by 50 percent, from 10 micrograms per meter cubed (μm3) to 5 μm3. These updated guidelines signify an aggressive attempt to promote the regulation and reduction of anthropogenic emissions in order to improve global air quality.

A new study by researchers in the MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering explores if the updated air quality guideline of 5 μm3 is realistically attainable across different regions of the world, particularly if anthropogenic emissions are aggressively reduced.

The first question the researchers wanted to investigate was to what degree moving to a no-fossil-fuel future would help different regions meet this new air quality guideline.

“The answer we found is that eliminating fossil-fuel emissions would improve air quality around the world, but while this would help some regions come into compliance with the WHO guidelines, for many other regions high contributions from natural sources would impede their ability to meet that target,” says senior author Colette Heald, the Germeshausen Professor in the MIT departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.

The study by Heald, Professor Jesse Kroll, and graduate students Sidhant Pai and Therese Carter, published June 6 in the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters, finds that over 90 percent of the global population is currently exposed to average annual concentrations that are higher than the recommended guideline. The authors go on to demonstrate that over 50 percent of the world’s population would still be exposed to PM2.5 concentrations that exceed the new air quality guidelines, even in the absence of all anthropogenic emissions.

This is due to the large natural sources of particulate matter — dust, sea salt, and organics from vegetation — that still exist in the atmosphere when anthropogenic emissions are removed from the air.

“If you live in parts of India or northern Africa that are exposed to large amounts of fine dust, it can be challenging to reduce PM2.5 exposures below the new guideline,” says Sidhant Pai, co-lead author and graduate student. “This study challenges us to rethink the value of different emissions abatement controls across different regions and suggests the need for a new generation of air quality metrics that can enable targeted decision-making.”

The researchers conducted a series of model simulations to explore the viability of achieving the updated PM2.5 guidelines worldwide under different emissions reduction scenarios, using 2019 as a representative baseline year.

Their model simulations used a suite of different anthropogenic sources that could be turned on and off to study the contribution of a particular source. For instance, the researchers conducted a simulation that turned off all human-based emissions in order to determine the amount of PM2.5 pollution that could be attributed to natural and fire sources. By analyzing the chemical composition of the PM2.5 aerosol in the atmosphere (e.g., dust, sulfate, and black carbon), the researchers were also able to get a more accurate understanding of the most important PM2.5 sources in a particular region. For example, elevated PM2.5 concentrations in the Amazon were shown to predominantly consist of carbon-containing aerosols from sources like deforestation fires. Conversely, nitrogen-containing aerosols were prominent in Northern Europe, with large contributions from vehicles and fertilizer usage. The two regions would thus require very different policies and methods to improve their air quality.

“Analyzing particulate pollution across individual chemical species allows for mitigation and adaptation decisions that are specific to the region, as opposed to a one-size-fits-all approach, which can be challenging to execute without an understanding of the underlying importance of different sources,” says Pai.

When the WHO air quality guidelines were last updated in 2005, they had a significant impact on environmental policies. Scientists could look at an area that was not in compliance and suggest high-level solutions to improve the region’s air quality. But as the guidelines have tightened, globally-applicable solutions to manage and improve air quality are no longer as evident.

“Another benefit of speciating is that some of the particles have different toxicity properties that are correlated to health outcomes,” says Therese Carter, co-lead author and graduate student. “It’s an important area of research that this work can help motivate. Being able to separate out that piece of the puzzle can provide epidemiologists with more insights on the different toxicity levels and the impact of specific particles on human health.”

The authors view these new findings as an opportunity to expand and iterate on the current guidelines.

“Routine and global measurements of the chemical composition of PM2.5 would give policymakers information on what interventions would most effectively improve air quality in any given location,” says Jesse Kroll, a professor in the MIT departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Chemical Engineering. “But it would also provide us with new insights into how different chemical species in PM2.5 affect human health.""

“I hope that as we learn more about the health impacts of these different particles, our work and that of the broader atmospheric chemistry community can help inform strategies to reduce the pollutants that are most harmful to human health,” adds Heald.",,[],['Stephanie Martinovich']

How Animals Perceive the World,"This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic, Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.

Within the 310,000 acres of Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park, one of the largest parking lots is in the village of Colter Bay. Beyond the lot’s far edge, nestled among some trees, is a foul-smelling sewage-pumping station that Jesse Barber, a sensory ecologist at Boise State University, calls the Shiterator. On this particular night, sitting quietly within a crevice beneath the building’s metal awning and illuminated by Barber’s flashlight, is a little brown bat. A white device the size of a rice grain is attached to the bat’s back. “That’s the radio tag,” Barber tells me. He’d previously affixed it to the bat so that he could track its movements, and tonight he has returned to tag a few more.

From inside the Shiterator, I can hear the chirps of other roosting bats. As the sun sets, they start to emerge. A few become entangled in the large net Barber has strung between two trees. He frees a bat, and Hunter Cole, one of his students, carefully examines it to check that it’s healthy and heavy enough to carry a tag. Once satisfied, Cole daubs a spot of surgical cement between its shoulder blades and attaches the tiny device. “It’s a little bit of an art project, the tagging of a bat,” Barber tells me. After a few minutes, Cole places the bat on the trunk of the nearest tree. It crawls upward and takes off, carrying $175 worth of radio equipment into the woods.

I watch as the team examines another bat, which opens its mouth and exposes its surprisingly long teeth. This isn’t an aggressive display; it only looks like one. The bat is unleashing a stream of short, ultrasonic pulses from its mouth, which are too high-pitched for me to hear. Bats, however, can hear ultrasound, and by listening for the returning echoes, they can detect and locate objects around them.

Echolocation is the primary means through which most bats navigate and hunt. Only two animal groups are known to have perfected the ability: toothed whales (such as dolphins, orcas, and sperm whales) and bats. Echolocation differs from human senses because it involves putting energy into the environment. Eyes scan, noses sniff, and fingers press, but these sense organs are always picking up stimuli that already exist in the wider world. By contrast, an echolocating bat creates the stimulus that it later detects. Echolocation is a way of tricking your surroundings into revealing themselves. A bat says “Marco,” and its surroundings can’t help but say “Polo.”

The basic process seems straightforward, but its details are extraordinary. High-pitched sounds quickly lose energy in air, so bats must scream to make calls that are strong enough to return audible echoes. To avoid deafening themselves, bats contract the muscles in their ears in time with their calls, desensitizing their hearing with every shout and restoring it in time for the echo. Each echo provides a snapshot in time, so bats must update their calls quickly to track fast-moving insects; fortunately, their vocal muscles are the fastest known muscles in any mammal, releasing up to 200 pulses a second. A bat’s nervous system is so sensitive that it can detect differences in echo delay of just one- or two-millionths of a second, which translates to a physical distance of less than a millimeter. A bat thus gauges the distance to an insect with far more precision than humans can.

Echolocation’s main weakness is its short range: Some bats can detect small moths from about six to nine yards away. But they can do so in darkness so total that vision simply doesn’t work. Even in pitch-blackness, bats can skirt around branches and pluck minuscule insects from the sky. Of course, bats are not the only animals that hunt nocturnally. In the Tetons, as I watch Barber tagging bats, mosquitoes bite me through my shirt, attracted by the smell of the carbon dioxide on my breath. While I itch, an owl flies overhead, tracking its prey using a radar dish of stiff facial feathers that funnel sound toward its ears. These creatures have all evolved senses that allow them to thrive in the dark. But the dark is disappearing.

Barber is one of a growing number of sensory biologists who fear that humans are polluting the world with too much light, to the detriment of other species. Even here, in the middle of a national park, light from human technology intrudes upon the darkness. It spews forth from the headlights of passing vehicles, from the fluorescent bulbs of the visitor center, and from the lampposts encircling the parked cars. “The parking lot is lit up like a Walmart because no one thought about the implications for wildlife,” Barber says.

Many flying insects are fatally attracted to streetlights, mistaking them for celestial lights and hovering below them until they succumb to exhaustion. Some bats exploit their confusion, feasting on the disoriented swarms. Other, slower-moving species, including the little brown bats that Barber tagged, stay clear of the light, perhaps because it makes them easier prey for owls. Lights reshape animal communities, drawing some in and pushing others away, with consequences that are hard to predict.

Every animal is enclosed within its own sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of an immense world.

To determine the effect of light on the bats of Grand Teton, Barber persuaded the National Park Service to let him try an unusual experiment. In 2019, he refitted all 32 streetlights in the Colter Bay parking lot with special bulbs that can change color. They can produce either white light, which strongly affects the behavior of insects and bats, or red light, which doesn’t seem to. Every few days during my visit, Barber’s team flips their color. Funnel-shaped traps hanging below the lamps collect the gathering insects, while radio transponders pick up the signals from the tagged bats. These data should reveal how normal white lights affect the local animals, and whether red lights can help rewild the night sky.

Cole gives me a little demonstration by flipping the lights to red. At first, the parking lot looks disquietingly infernal, as if we have stepped into a horror movie. But as my eyes adjust, the red hues feel less dramatic and become almost pleasant. It is amazing how much we can still see. The cars and the surrounding foliage are all visible. I look up and notice that fewer insects seem to be gathered beneath the lamps. I look up even farther and see the stripe of the Milky Way cutting across the sky. It’s an achingly beautiful sight, one I have never seen before in the Northern Hemisphere.

Every animal is enclosed within its own sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of an immense world. There is a wonderful word for this sensory bubble—Umwelt. It was defined and popularized by the Baltic German zoologist Jakob von Uexküll in 1909. Umwelt comes from the German word for “environment,” but Uexküll didn’t use it to refer to an animal’s surroundings. Instead, an Umwelt is specifically the part of those surroundings that an animal can sense and experience—its perceptual world. A tick, questing for mammalian blood, cares about body heat, the touch of hair, and the odor of butyric acid that emanates from skin. It doesn’t care about other stimuli, and probably doesn’t know that they exist. Every Umwelt is limited; it just doesn’t feel that way. Each one feels all-encompassing to those who experience it. Our Umwelt is all we know, and so we easily mistake it for all there is to know. This is an illusion that every creature shares.

Humans, however, possess the unique capacity to appreciate the Umwelten of other species, and through centuries of effort, we have learned much about those sensory worlds. But in the time it took us to accumulate that knowledge, we have radically remolded those worlds. Much of the devastation that we have wrought is by now familiar. We have changed the climate and acidified the oceans. We have shuffled wildlife across continents, replacing indigenous species with invasive ones. We have instigated what some scientists have called an era of “biological annihilation,” comparable to the five great mass-extinction events of prehistory. But we have also filled the silence with noise and the night with light. This often ignored phenomenon is called sensory pollution—human-made stimuli that interfere with the senses of other species. By barraging different animals with stimuli of our own making, we have forced them to live in our Umwelt. We have distracted them from what they actually need to sense, drowned out the cues they depend upon, and lured them into sensory traps. All of this is capable of doing catastrophic damage.

In 2001, the astronomer Pierantonio Cinzano and his colleagues created the first global atlas of light pollution. They calculated that two-thirds of the world’s population lived in light-polluted areas, where the nights were at least 10 percent brighter than natural darkness. About 40 percent of humankind is permanently bathed in the equivalent of perpetual moonlight, and about 25 percent constantly experiences an artificial twilight that exceeds the illumination of a full moon. “‘Night’ never really comes for them,” the researchers wrote. In 2016, when the team updated the atlas, it found that the problem had become even worse. By then, about 83 percent of people—including more than 99 percent of Americans and Europeans—were under light-polluted skies. More than a third of humanity, and almost 80 percent of North Americans, can no longer see the Milky Way. “The thought of light traveling billions of years from distant galaxies only to be washed out in the last billionth of a second by the glow from the nearest strip mall depresses me to no end,” the visual ecologist Sönke Johnsen once wrote.

At Colter Bay, Cole flips the lights from red back to white and I wince. The extra illumination feels harsh and unpleasant. The stars seem fainter now. Sensory pollution is the pollution of disconnection. It detaches us from the cosmos. It drowns out the stimuli that link animals to their surroundings and to one another. In making the planet brighter and louder, we have endangered sensory environments for countless species in ways that are less viscerally galling than clear-cut rain forests and bleached coral reefs but no less tragic. That must now change. We can still save the quiet and preserve the dark.

Each is produced by 44 xenon bulbs with 7,000-watt intensities. Their light can be seen from 60 miles away. From closer up, onlookers often notice small flecks, dancing amid the beams like gentle flurries of snow. Those flecks are birds. Thousands of them.

This annual ritual unfortunately occurs during the autumn migratory season, when billions of small songbirds undertake long flights through North American skies. Navigating under cover of darkness, they fly in such large numbers that they show up on radar. By analyzing meteorological radar images, Benjamin Van Doren showed that Tribute in Light, across seven nights of operation, waylaid about 1.1 million birds. The beams reach so high that even at altitudes of several miles, passing birds are drawn into them. Warblers and other small species congregate within the light at up to 150 times their normal density levels. They circle slowly, as if trapped in an incorporeal cage. They call frequently and intensely. They occasionally crash into nearby buildings.

Migrations are grueling affairs that push small birds to their physiological limit. Even a night-long detour can sap their energy reserves to fatal effect. So whenever 1,000 or more birds are caught within Tribute in Light, the bulbs are turned off for 20 minutes to let the birds regain their bearing. But that’s just one source of light among many, and though intense and vertical, it shines only once a year. At other times, light pours out of sports stadiums and tourist attractions, oil rigs and office buildings. It pushes back the dark and pulls in migrating birds.

In 1886, shortly after Thomas Edison commercialized the electric light bulb, about 1,000 birds died after colliding with illuminated towers in Decatur, Illinois. More than a century later, the environmental scientist Travis Longcore and his colleagues calculated that almost 7 million birds die each year in the United States and Canada after flying into communication towers. The lights of those towers are meant to warn aircraft pilots, but they also disrupt the orientation of nocturnal avian fliers, which then veer into wires or each other. Many of these deaths could be avoided simply by replacing steady lights with blinking ones.

“We too quickly forget that we don’t perceive the world in the same way as other species, and consequently, we ignore impacts that we shouldn’t,” Longcore tells me in his Los Angeles office. Our eyes are among the sharpest in the animal kingdom, but their high resolution comes with the cost of low sensitivity. Unlike most other mammals, our vision fails us at night, so we crave more nocturnal illumination, not less.

Read: The dark side of light

The idea of light as a pollutant is jarring to us, but it becomes one when it creeps into places where it doesn’t belong. Widespread light at night is a uniquely anthropogenic force. The daily and seasonal rhythms of bright and dark remained largely inviolate throughout all of evolutionary time—a 4-billion-year streak that began to falter in the 19th century.

When sea-turtle hatchlings emerge from their nests, they crawl away from the dark shapes of dune vegetation toward the brighter oceanic horizon. But lit roads and beach resorts can steer them in the wrong direction, where they are easily picked off by predators or squashed by vehicles. In Florida alone, artificial lights kill baby turtles in the thousands every year. They’ve wandered into a baseball game and, more horrifying, abandoned beach fires. The caretaker of one property in Melbourne Beach found hundreds of dead hatchlings piled beneath a single mercury-vapor lamp.

Artificial lights can also fatally attract insects, contributing to their alarming global declines. A single streetlamp can lure moths from 25 yards away, and a well-lit road might as well be a prison. Many of the insects that gather around streetlamps will likely be eaten or dead from exhaustion by sunrise. Those that zoom toward vehicle headlights will probably be gone even sooner. The consequences of these losses can ripple across ecosystems. In 2014, as part of an experiment, the ecologist Eva Knop installed streetlamps in seven Swiss meadows. After sunset, she prowled these fields with night-vision goggles, peering into flowers to search for moths and other pollinators. By comparing these sites to others that had been kept dark, Knop showed that the illuminated flowers received 62 percent fewer visits from pollinating insects. One plant produced 13 percent less fruit even though it was visited by a day shift of bees and butterflies.

The presence of light isn’t the only factor that matters; so does its nature. Insects with aquatic larvae, such as mayflies and dragonflies, will fruitlessly lay their eggs on wet roads, windows, and car roofs, because these reflect horizontally polarized light in the same way bodies of water do. Rapidly flickering light bulbs can cause headaches and other neurological problems in humans, even though our eyes are usually too slow to detect these changes; what, then, do they do to animals with faster vision, like insects and small birds?

Colors matter, too. Red is better for bats and insects but can waylay migrating birds. Yellow doesn’t bother turtles or most insects but can disrupt salamanders. No wavelength is perfect, Longcore says, but blue and white are worst of all. Blue light interferes with body clocks and strongly attracts insects. It is also easily scattered, increasing the spread of light pollution. It is, however, cheap and efficient to produce. The new generation of energy-efficient white LEDs contain a lot of blue light, and the world might switch to them from traditional yellow-orange sodium lights. In energy terms, that would be an environmental win. But it would also increase the amount of global light pollution by two or three times.

From the April 2020 issue: Ed Yong on how we can save giraffes from extinction

After talking with Longcore, I head home to Washington, D.C., on a red-eye flight. As the plane takes off, I peer out the window at Los Angeles. The twinkling grid of lights stirs the same primordial awe that comes from watching a starry sky or a moonlit sea. But as the illuminated city recedes beneath my window, that amazement is tinged with unease. Light pollution is no longer just an urban problem. Light travels, encroaching even into places that are otherwise untouched by human influence. The light from Los Angeles reaches Death Valley, one of the largest national parks in the United States, more than 150 miles away. True darkness is hard to find.

So is true silence.

It’s a sunny April morning in Boulder, Colorado, and I’ve hiked up to a rocky hillside, about 6,000 feet above sea level. The world feels wider here, not just because of the panoramic view over conifer forests but also because it is blissfully quiet. Away from urban ruckus, quieter sounds become audible over greater distances. On the hillside, a chipmunk is rustling. Grasshoppers snap their wings together as they fly. A woodpecker pounds its beak against a nearby trunk. Wind rushes past. The longer I sit, the more I seem to hear.

Two men puncture the tranquility. I can’t see them, but they’re somewhere on the trail below, intent on broadcasting their opinions to all of Colorado. Then I realize I can also hear faraway vehicles zooming along a highway beyond the trees. Denver hums in the distance, an ambient backdrop that I had all but blocked out. I notice the roaring engines of a plane flying overhead. After my hike, I meet up with Kurt Fristrup, who says he’s been backpacking since the mid-1960s. In that time, aircraft emissions have increased nearly sevenfold. “One of my favorite parlor tricks when friends visit is to ask, at the end of the hike, if they heard any aircraft,” he tells me. “People will say they remember one or two. And I’ll say there were 23 jets and two helicopters.”

Before he retired, Fristrup was a scientist at the National Park Service’s Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division, a group that works to safeguard (among other things) the United States’ natural soundscapes. To protect them, the team first had to map them, and sound, unlike light, can’t be detected by satellites. Fristrup and his colleagues spent years lugging recording equipment to almost 500 sites around the country, capturing nearly 1.5 million audio samples. They found that human activity doubles the background-noise levels in 63 percent of protected spaces like national parks, and increases them tenfold in 21 percent. In the latter places, “if you could have heard something 100 feet away, now you can only hear it 10 feet away,” Rachel Buxton, a former National Park Service research fellow, told me. Aircraft and roads are the main culprits, but so are industries like oil and gas extraction, mining, and forestry, which fill the air with drilling, explosions, engine noises, and the thud of heavy tires. Even the most heavily protected areas are under acoustic siege.

In towns and cities, the problem is worse, and not just in the United States. In 2005, two-thirds of Europeans were immersed in ambient noise equivalent to perpetual rainfall. Such conditions are difficult for the many animals that communicate through calls and songs. Scientists have found that noisy neighborhoods in Leiden, in the Netherlands, compel great tits to sing at higher frequencies so that their notes don’t get masked by the city’s low-pitched hubbub. Nightingales in Berlin are forced to belt out their tunes more loudly to be heard over the surrounding din. Urban and industrial noise can also change the timing of birds’ songs, suppress the complexity of their calls, and prevent them from finding mates. Noise pollution masks not only the sounds that animals deliberately make but also the “web of unintended sounds that ties communities together,” Fristrup says. He means the gentle rustles that tell owls where their prey is, or the faint flaps that warn mice about impending doom.

In 2012, Jesse Barber and his colleagues Heidi Ware Carlisle and Christopher McClure built a phantom road. On a ridge in Idaho that acts as a stopover for migrating birds, the team set up a half-mile corridor of speakers that played looped recordings of passing cars. A third of the usual birds stayed away. Many of those that didn’t paid a price for persisting. With tires and horns drowning out the sounds of predators, the birds spent more time looking for danger and less time looking for food. They put on less weight and were weaker during their arduous migrations. The phantom-road experiment was pivotal in showing that wildlife could be deterred by noise and noise alone, detached from the sight of vehicles or the stench of exhaust. Hundreds of studies have come to similar conclusions. In noisy conditions, prairie dogs spend more time underground. Owls flub their attacks. Parasitic Ormia flies struggle to find their cricket hosts.

Sounds can travel over long distances, at all times of day, and through solid obstacles. These qualities make them excellent stimuli for animals but also pollutants par excellence. Noise can degrade habitats that look idyllic and make otherwise livable places unlivable. And where will animals go? In 2003, 83 percent of the contiguous United States lay within about a kilometer of a road.

Even the seas can’t offer silence. Although Jacques Cousteau once described the ocean as a silent world, it is anything but. It teems with the sounds of breaking waves and blowing winds, bubbling hydrothermal vents and calving icebergs, all of which carry farther and travel faster underwater than in air. Marine animals are noisy, too. Whales sing, toadfish hum, cod grunt, and bearded seals trill. Thousands of snapping shrimp, which stun passing fish with the shock waves produced by their large claws, fill coral reefs with sounds similar to sizzling bacon or Rice Krispies popping in milk. Some of this soundscape has been muted as humans have netted, hooked, and harpooned the oceans’ residents. Other natural noises have been drowned out by the ones we added: the scrapes of nets that trawl the seafloor; the staccato beats of seismic charges used to scout for oil and gas; the pings of military sonar; and, as a ubiquitous backing track for all this commotion, the sounds of ships.

“Think about where your shoes come from,” the marine-mammal expert John Hildebrand tells me. I look; unsurprisingly, the answer is China. Some tanker carried my shoes across the Pacific, leaving behind a wake of sound that radiated for miles. From 1945 to 2008, the global shipping fleet more than tripled, and began moving 10 times more cargo at higher speeds. And in the past 50 years, shipping vessels have multiplied the levels of low-frequency noise in the oceans 32-fold—a 15-decibel increase over levels that Hildebrand suspects were already 10 to 15 decibels louder than in pre-propeller seas. Because giant whales can live for a century or more, there are likely whales alive today that have personally experienced this growing underwater racket and now can hear only a small fraction of their former range. As ships pass in the night, humpback whales stop singing, orcas stop foraging, and right whales become stressed. Crabs stop feeding, cuttlefish change colors, damselfish are more easily caught. “If I said that I’m going to increase the noise level in your office by 30 decibels, OSHA would come in and say you’d need to wear earplugs,” Hildebrand tells me. “We’re conducting an experiment on marine animals by exposing them to these high levels of noise, and it’s not an experiment we’d allow to be conducted on ourselves.”

Because of the way we have upended the worlds of other animals, senses that have served their owners well for millions of years are now liabilities. Smooth vertical surfaces, which don’t exist in nature, return echoes that sound like open air; perhaps that’s why bats so often crash into windows. Dimethyl sulfide, the seaweedy-smelling chemical that once reliably guided seabirds to food, now also guides them to the millions of tons of plastic waste that humans have dumped into the oceans; perhaps that’s one reason an estimated 90 percent of seabirds eventually swallow plastic. Manatees can detect the currents produced by objects moving in the water with whiskerlike hairs found all over their body, but not with enough notice to avoid a loud, fast-moving speedboat; boat collisions are responsible for at least a fifth of deaths among Florida’s manatees. Odorants in river water can guide salmon back to their stream of birth, but not if pesticides in that same water blunt their sense of smell. Weak electric fields at the bottom of the sea can guide sharks to buried prey, but also to high-voltage cables.

Some animals have come to tolerate the sights and sounds of modernity. Others even flourish among them. Some urban moths have evolved to become less attracted to light. Some urban spiders have gone in the opposite direction, spinning webs beneath streetlights and feasting on the attracted insects. In some Panama towns, nighttime lights drive frog-eating bats away, allowing male túngara frogs to load their songs with sexy flourishes that would normally attract predators as well as mates. Animals can adapt, by changing their behavior over an individual lifetime and by evolving new behaviors over many generations.

Read: Why some moths are evolving to avoid artificial light

But adaptation is not always possible. Species that mature and breed slowly can’t evolve quickly enough to keep pace with levels of light and noise pollution that double every few decades. Creatures that have already been confined to narrow corners of shrinking habitats can’t just up and leave. Those that rely on specialized senses can’t just retune their entire Umwelt.

With every creature that vanishes, we lose a way of interpreting the world.

Our influence is not inherently destructive, but it is often homogenizing. In pushing out species that cannot abide our sensory onslaughts, we leave behind smaller and less diverse communities. And beyond polluting the world with unwanted sensory stimuli, we’re also removing natural stimuli that animals have come to depend on, flattening the undulating sensescapes that have generated the wondrous variety of animal Umwelten.

Consider Lake Victoria, in East Africa. It is home to more than 500 species of cichlid fish that are found nowhere else. That extraordinary diversity arose partly because of light. In deeper parts of the lake, light tends to be yellow or orange, while blue is more plentiful in shallower waters. These differences affected the eyes of the local cichlids and, in turn, their mating choices. The evolutionary biologist Ole Seehausen found that female cichlids from deeper waters prefer redder males, while those in the shallows are drawn to bluer ones. These diverging penchants acted like physical barriers, splitting the cichlids into differently colored forms. Diversity in light helped create diversity in vision, in color, and in species. But over the past century, runoff from farms, mines, and sewage filled the lake with nutrients that spurred the growth of clouding, choking algae. The old light gradients flattened in some places, the cichlids’ colors and visual proclivities no longer mattered, and the number of species collapsed. By turning off the light in the lake, humans also switched off the sensory engine of diversity, contributing to what Seehausen has called “the fastest large-scale extinction event ever observed.”

As those species go extinct, so too do their Umwelten. With every creature that vanishes, we lose a way of interpreting the world. Our sensory bubbles shield us from the knowledge of those losses. But they don’t protect us from the consequences. In the woodlands of New Mexico, the ecologists Clinton Francis and Catherine Ortega found that the Woodhouse’s scrub-jay avoids the noise of compressors used in extracting natural gas. The scrub-jay spreads the seeds of piñon pine trees, and a single bird can bury thousands of pine seeds a year. They are so important to the forests that, in quiet areas where they still thrive, pine seedlings are four times more common than in noisy areas they have abandoned, Francis and colleagues found in a later study.

Piñon pines are the foundation of the ecosystem around them—a single species that provides food and shelter for hundreds of others, including Indigenous Americans. To lose three-quarters of them would be disastrous. And because they grow slowly, “noise might have hundred-plus-year consequences for the entire ecosystem,” Francis tells me.

A better understanding of other creatures’ senses can show us how we’re defiling the natural world—and can also point to ways of saving it. In 2016, the marine biologist Tim Lamont (formerly Tim Gordon) traveled to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef to begin work for his doctorate. Lamont should have spent months swimming amid the corals’ vivid splendor. Instead, a heat wave had forced the corals to expel the symbiotic algae that give them nutrients and colors. Without these partners, the corals starved and whitened in the worst bleaching event on record, and the first of several to come. Snorkeling through the rubble, Lamont found that the reefs had been not only bleached but also silenced. Snapping shrimp no longer snapped. Parrotfish no longer crunched. Those sounds normally help guide baby fish back to the reef after their first vulnerable months out at sea. Soundless reefs were much less attractive.

Lamont feared that if fish avoided the degraded reefs, the seaweed they normally eat would run amok, overgrowing the bleached corals and preventing them from rebounding. He and his colleagues set up loudspeakers that continuously played recordings of healthy reefs over patches of coral rubble. The team would dive every few days to survey the local animals. After 40 days, he ran the numbers and saw that the acoustically enriched reefs had twice as many young fish as silent ones and 50 percent more species. They had not only been attracted by the sounds but stayed and formed a community. “It was a lovely experiment to do,” Lamont says. It showed what conservationists can accomplish by “seeing the world through the perceptions of the animals you’re trying to protect.”

From the July 2019 issue: The last of its kind

Lamont’s experiment was possible only because the team managed to record the sounds of the healthy reefs before they were bleached. Natural sensescapes still exist. There is still time to preserve and restore them before the last echo of the last reef fades into memory. And in most cases, the work ahead of us is considerably simpler. Instead of adding stimuli that we have removed, we can simply remove those that we added. Radioactive waste can take millennia to degrade. Persistent chemicals like the pesticide DDT can thread through the bodies of animals long after they are banned. Plastics will continue to despoil the oceans even if all plastic production halts tomorrow. But light pollution ceases as soon as lights are turned off. Noise pollution abates once engines and propellers wind down. Sensory pollution is an ecological gimme—a rare example of a planetary problem that can be immediately and effectively addressed. And in the spring of 2020, the world did unknowingly address it.

As the coronavirus spread, public spaces closed. Flights were grounded. Cars stayed parked. Cruise ships stayed docked. About 4.5 billion people—almost three-fifths of the world’s population—were told or encouraged to stay home. As a result, many places became substantially darker and quieter. With fewer planes and cars on the move, the night skies around Berlin were half as bright as normal. Alaska’s Glacier Bay, a sanctuary for humpback whales, was half as loud as the previous year, as were cities and rural areas throughout California, New York, Florida, and Texas. Sounds that would normally be muffled became clearer. City dwellers around the world suddenly noticed singing birds.

Read: Artificial lights tell the story of the pandemic

In a multitude of ways, the pandemic showed that sensory pollution can be reduced if people are sufficiently motivated—and such reductions are possible without the debilitating consequences of a global lockdown. In the summer of 2007, Kurt Fristrup and his National Park Service colleagues did a simple experiment at Muir Woods National Monument, in California. On a random schedule, they stuck up signs that declared one of the most popular parts of the park a quiet zone and encouraged visitors to silence their phones and lower their voices. These simple steps, with no accompanying enforcement, reduced the noise levels in the park by three decibels, equivalent to 1,200 fewer visitors.

To perceive the world through others’ senses is to find splendor in familiarity, and the sacred in the mundane.

To truly make a dent in sensory pollution, bigger steps are needed. Lights can be dimmed or switched off when buildings and streets are not in use. They can be shielded so that they stop shining above the horizon. LEDs can be changed from blue or white to red. Quiet pavements with porous surfaces can absorb the noise from passing vehicles. Sound-absorbing barriers, including berms on land and air-bubble curtains in the water, can soften the din of traffic and industry. Vehicles can be diverted from important areas of wilderness, or they can be forced to slow down: In 2007, when commercial ships in the Mediterranean began slowing down by just 12 percent, which saves fuel and reduces emissions, they produced half as much noise. Such vessels can also be fitted with quieter hulls and propellers, which are already used to muffle military ships (and would make commercial ones more fuel-efficient).

We could regulate industries causing sensory pollution, but there’s not enough societal will. “Plastic pollution in the sea looks hideous and everyone is worried, but noise pollution in the sea is something we don’t experience so directly, so no one’s up in arms about it,” Lamont says. And as we desecrate sensory environments, we grow accustomed to the results. Our blinding, blaring world becomes normal, and pristine wilderness feels more distant.

But the majesty of nature is not restricted to canyons and mountains. It can be found in the wilds of perception—the sensory spaces that lie outside our Umwelt and within those of other animals. To perceive the world through others’ senses is to find splendor in familiarity, and the sacred in the mundane. Wonders exist in a backyard garden, where bees take the measure of a flower’s electric fields, leafhoppers send vibrational melodies through the stems of plants, and birds behold the hidden palettes of ultraviolet colors on their flock-mates’ feathers. Wilderness is not distant. We are continually immersed in it. It is there for us to imagine, to savor, and to protect.

In 1934, after considering the senses of ticks, dogs, jackdaws, and wasps, Jakob von Uexküll wrote about the Umwelt of the astronomer. “Through gigantic optical aids,” he wrote, this unique creature has eyes that “are capable of penetrating outer space as far as the most distant stars. In its Umwelt, suns and planets circle at a solemn pace.” The tools of astronomy can capture stimuli that no animal can naturally sense—X-rays, radio waves, gravitational waves from colliding black holes. They extend the human Umwelt across the universe and back to its very beginning. The tools of biologists are more modest in scale, but they, too, offer a glimpse into the infinite. Scientists have used night-vision goggles to show that nocturnal bees can see in extreme darkness, clip-on microphones to eavesdrop on the vibrational songs of leafhoppers, and electrodes to listen in on the pulses of electric fish. With microscopes, cameras, speakers, satellites, and recorders, people have explored other sensory worlds. We have used technology to make the invisible visible and the inaudible audible.

No creature could possibly sense everything, and no creature needs to. Evolving according to their owner’s needs, the senses sort through an infinity of stimuli, allowing through only what is relevant. To learn about the rest is a choice. The ability to dip into other Umwelten is our greatest sensory skill. A moth will never know what a zebra finch hears in its song, a zebra finch will never feel the electric buzz of a black ghost knifefish, a knifefish will never see through the eyes of a mantis shrimp, a mantis shrimp will never smell the way a dog can, and a dog will never understand what it is like to be a bat. We will never fully do any of these things either, but we are the only animal that can try. Through patient observation, through the technologies at our disposal, through the scientific method, and, above all else, through our curiosity and imagination, we can try to step into perspectives outside our own. This is a profound gift, which comes with a heavy responsibility. As the only species that can come close to understanding other Umwelten, but also the species most responsible for destroying those sensory realms, it falls on us to marshal all of our empathy and ingenuity to protect other creatures, and their unique ways of experiencing our shared world.",,[],['Ed Yong']
U.S. EPA to Distribute $60 Million to 12 States for Water Pollution Control,"According to the U.S. EPA, the federal government will distribute $60 million among 12 states that have waterways that flow into the Mississippi River.

The goal is to help control farm runoff and other pollution contributing to a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, reported AP News.

The money comes from the infrastructure law, according to the EPA. The states are Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin.

“The Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico watershed is an iconic ecosystem that millions of Americans depend on for drinking water, agriculture, recreation and economic development and it is essential that we reduce nutrient pollution that harms water quality,” said Radhika Fox, EPA assistant administrator.

The $60 million will be distributed over the next five years, according to EPA, reported AP News. Each state will receive $965,000 this year and $748,000 for each of the next three years and in 2026 each state will receive $965,000 again.

According to Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, who is also co-chairman of the 12-member Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force, the task force wants to reduce the phosphorus and nitrogen that flows from rivers and streams into the Mississippi River, reported AP News.

According to AP News, the funds will: buy agricultural equipment; deploy remote-sensing tools to identify critical sources of contaminants; implement continuous real-time water quality monitoring; develop or revise numeric nutrient criteria and water quality standards; and support farmer-led education, training and demonstrations of on-farm methods.

The Watershed Nutrient Task Force has a long-term goal of reducing the dead zone to 1,900 square miles, which is about 35% of its current average area.

Barcelona to install sound level monitors in bid to beat noise pollution,"Barcelona’s streets and plazas have long been home to a raucous cacophony of restaurant patios, buskers and throngs of residents and tourists. Now the city is on a mission to find out just how noisy these spaces can get, with the installation of sound level monitors in 11 areas.

“It’s an absolute priority,” said Eloi Badia, the Barcelona city councillor for climate emergency and ecological transition. “Noise pollution – with all of its sleep disorders, pathologies and stress – is one of the most important public health issues we have in the city, second only to air pollution.”

A recent study by Barcelona’s public health agency found that about 57% of people in the city are regularly exposed to noise levels that exceed those recommended by the World Health Organization. The figure dwarfs the estimates across Europe, where one in five are exposed to harmful levels of noise pollution.

In the coming days, sound meters are expected to be installed in all the areas where residents regularly complain of noise. From there officials will start listening. Acceptable decibel limits vary from area to area, based on factors such as the width of the street or the distribution of buildings.

“If the limits are exceeded during two consecutive weekends, the area will be confirmed as acoustically stressed,” Badia said. “In that case the district will have to present an action plan that can be worked on with neighbours, restaurants and others to try to mitigate the damage that is being done.”

Potential actions could include limiting outdoor dining hours or curbing the hours that local stores sell alcohol. Residents whose areas are deemed “acoustically stressed” will also be able to access grants to help them insulate windows and soundproof their homes.

The initiative builds on a network of sound level meters already set up in the city, which had allowed officials to take sporadic action to address soaring noise levels, such as clearing out a plaza. With the recognition of specific acoustically stressed areas, officials hope to pave the way for lasting solutions. “Our goal is to have a much quieter, more peaceful and friendly city,” Badia said.

The initiative is part of a broader set of measures – from traffic calming to the reduction of noise at work sites – to be rolled out in Barcelona in the coming years. Many are aimed at quelling traffic noise, which ranks as the city’s primary source of noise pollution.

Issues have also long flared up around the city’s nightlife. On Thursday more than 30 associations will take to the streets to protest under the banner of “Silence … Noise kills!”

Among those planning to attend is Jordi Badia, whose street is home to one of Barcelona’s highest concentrations of restaurant terraces. “We have 114 residential buildings and 116 licensed terraces,” he told El Periódico.

Noise levels have rocketed in recent months, fuelled by the proliferation of outdoor seating during the pandemic, Badia said. “There are stretches where it is brutal. It’s not just the terraces and the people, we have bars that close at three in the morning. When people leave at three in the morning, you can just imagine how it is.”",,[],['Ashifa Kassam']
U.S. wants Canada to join investigation of cross-border pollution from B.C. coal mines,"The United States government, including President Joe Biden's White House, has joined calls for Canada to participate in a probe of cross-border pollution coming from coal mines in southern British Columbia.

In a statement released last week, the U.S. State Department said Biden supports a joint investigation of selenium coming from Teck Resources' Elk Valley coal mines, which flows into rivers and lakes south of the border.

""The (State) Department reaffirmed the administration's support for a joint reference to the International Joint Commission under the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 for the Kootenai Basin regarding the transboundary impacts of mining,"" said the statement issued Wednesday.

Global Affairs Canada did not immediately respond to a request for a response. On June 2, spokesperson Adrien Blanchard said in an email that Canada was ""considering a variety of options.""

The U.S. has been concerned about the Teck mines for years. The states of Montana and Idaho, eight American senators, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey and six First Nations from both sides of the border have all said selenium released by the mines threatens fish in their downstream waters.

Several of those groups have requested a reference from the International Joint Commission, which tries to mediate transboundary water disputes. References, an examination of the problem followed by recommendations, have almost always been conducted by both countries together.

The U.S. embassy in Ottawa said the State Department has been ""in discussions"" with Canada over the issue since September. The U.S. ambassador has brought it up with B.C. Premier John Horgan, as has the U.S. consulate in Vancouver.

""There is an acute and long-standing need to reduce transboundary pollution from mining in the Kootenai Basin,"" said a spokesperson. ""We want to work with our Canadian colleagues to promptly submit a joint reference to the (commission).""

Canada and the U.S., through the commission, have worked jointly on problems in the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain in Quebec and the Souris River basin in Manitoba.

The commission has said it's willing to look at the matter and has asked Canada to participate. Now, the State Department has echoed that request.

In its statement, it said Canada's participation in an Elk Valley reference would lead to ""impartial recommendations and transparent communication, build trust, and forge a common understanding of this issue among local, Indigenous, state, provincial and federal governments as well as stakeholders and the public in both countries.""

The statement emphasized First Nation concerns, underscoring ""the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to strengthening Nation-to-Nation relationships.""

""Support for a joint IJC reference reflects the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to protect public health; conserve our lands, waters, and biodiversity; and deliver environmental justice to communities overburdened by pollution.""

The government statement was preceded by a statement from the six Ktunaxa First Nations in the area, which have been asking Canada to join the reference since December.

""We're demanding meaningful dialogue,"" said Nasukin Gravelle of the Tobacco Plains First Nation.

""The missing piece here is Canada's seeming refusal to participate in a joint reference submission to get the ball rolling on viable, science-based solutions. It's a disappointment and a sad day for reconciliation when progress on dealing with the pollution of our waterways is blocked by a federal government.""

Company protests selenium limits

Teck has acknowledged the problem.

The company said it has spent $1.2 billion on water treatment and plans to spend a further $750 million. It said about 95 per cent of selenium is now removed from water.

However, it has protested what it calls unreasonably low selenium limits brought in by Montana. It said those limits, which apply to the reservoir shared by both countries, are even lower than natural selenium levels in upstream rivers.

Still, the commission has said that selenium concentrations in some parts of that reservoir — Lake Koocanusa — are more than five times Montana's limits, although the levels are lower elsewhere.",,[],[]
Brush pile hours extended at Water Pollution Control Center,"Tiffin, Ohio — Following high winds in the area that may have downed trees or limbs, the City of Tiffin has extended the hours at the Water Pollution Control Center (WPCC) brush collection pile to 7 a.m.-7 p.m. through Friday this week for residents to drop off brush.

Hours remain unchanged Saturday and Sunday, 7 a.m.-2:30 p.m.

City Crews are not conducting any neighborhood brush pickups along boulevards or tree lawns, so these longer hours are meant to support residents who have yet to remove debris or brush from Monday’s storm.

What are nurdles? The invisible plastic pollution problem explained,"They’re usually made out of polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, or other plastic types, and sometimes have different densities depending on how they’re made.

The pellets are transported around the world for use by numerous different companies that use plastic in their supply chains, usually in containers on ships.

They’re considered a type of “primary microplastic”, meaning they’re intentionally produced to be very small.

Secondary microplastics are those which are formed when larger plastics break down in the natural environment, and are usually much smaller than nurdles.

How do nurdles end up in the ocean?

With billions of nurdles transported around the world via ships every year – you can probably see where this is going – billions of the small pellets end up in the ocean through poor management or accidents.

Some spills from shipping containers have proved disastrous for the environment.

In 2021, 87 containers filled with nurdles spilled into the ocean off the coast of Sri Lanka, making it the worst environmental disaster in the country’s history and the largest plastic spill in human history.

After the incident, billions of nurdles began washing up on beaches in the area, with piles up to two metres deep in some places.

Why are nurdles so bad for the environment?

The presence of nurdles in the natural environment is damaging in multiple ways.

Nurdles are usually produced using natural gas or oil, meaning their production drives up greenhouse gases and climate change.

They also have a damaging impact on marine and bird life, with animals frequently mistaking the colourful pellets for food.

When fish or sea birds ingest plastics, they can starve due to feeling artificially full and abstaining from eating. After the 2021 spill near Sri Lanka, numerous dolphins, fish and birds were discovered dead after ingesting nurdles.

Nurdles can also absorb toxic chemicals from the air, sea or land, meaning that animals can also be poisoned by the pellets.

Some research suggests that nurdles washed up on beaches can also change the characteristics of sand by, for instance, altering its temperature. This can have an impact on other animal life like turtles.

Humans are not immune from the damage either.

Article continues below Search jobs

Studies have repeatedly shown that microplastics – whether nurdles or larger, broken-down pieces of plastic – are now in our food chain and are being regularly ingested by humans.

The impact of microplastic ingestion on humans isn’t fully understood, but it’s believed that microplastics could drive or contribute to numerous health complications, including inflammation in the body.

Studies of nurdles on bathing beaches in Scotland have also shown that nurdles carry harmful bacteria like e-coli, which can cause infections in humans.

How can I help prevent the problem?

There are small actions you can take as an individual to prevent nurdle pollution, namely by reducing your own plastic consumption and educating your friends and family about the issue.

However, the issue is of a global scale and it will take collaborative effort to get nurdles out of the ocean once and for all.

Organisations such as The Great Nurdle Hunt are working on the problem, and there are numerous ways you can help them in the battle to stop nurdles entering the ocean.

One easy way to get involved is to go “nurdle hunting”: head down to your nearest beach and keep a count of how many nurdles you find there. Your results can then be submitted to The Great Nurdle Hunt online. The organisation will then use your data to lobby policymakers on the nurdle issue.

The Great Nurdle Hunt also has a list of actions you can take to help solve the problem on a global scale, including information on which regulator to report large spills to and links to consultations on reducing the number of pellets used in supply chains.",,[],[]
"Ban Debarking Procedures, End Pony Rides in LA, Cut Air Pollution: 10 Petitions to Sign this Week to Help People, Animals, and the Planet!","Unfortunately, the world is not a very peaceful or safe place for many individuals. From conflict to abuse to exploitation, there is so much cruelty inflicted on both humans and animals. While this can get disheartening and difficult to hear about, petitions are a great way to use your voice for good. Just by signing one, you are a part of helping those who are not treated fairly. You can even share them with your friends and acquaintances to increase your impact.

Through petitions, we can reach those in power and demand justice for others. They are valuable tools for making positive changes in the world. If you are looking for a way to help animals and humans, here are 10 petitions you should sign this week, including Ban Debarking Procedures, End Pony Rides in Los Angeles, and Cut Air Pollution.

We want to thank you for being the change you wish to see in the world and giving a voice to the voiceless.

1. Ban Debarking Procedures Now!

Debarking is accomplished by way of major invasive surgery at the risk of infection, blood loss, and other complications. After these surgeries, the animals are highly at risk of infection, especially since the larynx and trachea cannot be completely sterilized during surgery. There’s also the risk of “webbing,” which can lead to respiratory problems and cause tracheitis. The goal of this painful procedure is to muffle or eliminate dog barking. Sign this petition to demand the North Carolina state legislature pass a bill that bans debarking!

2. Shut down ABQ BioPark for letting baby elephants die

Since 2012, every single baby elephant born at ABQ BioPark has died tragically of endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV). The poor elephants left will remain tragically enclosed in the same lifeless yard, completely removed from their wild, natural habitat. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals and have complex social needs to maintain their psychological welfare, says Wild Welfare. These animals’ health and psychological well-being are at-risk the longer they live in isolation. Sign this petition to demand that the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) revoke the license for ABQ BioPark and prevent more innocent elephants from dying!

3. Demand that Los Angeles end pony rides

Recently, the inhumane conditions at the Griffith Park Pony Rides in Los Angeles have caught the attention of animal advocates. According to an inspection by an equine expert, these poor ponies needed medical attention that they simply weren’t getting – their owner was too busy selling their bodies for human entertainment. Our failure to recognize and appreciate animals as intelligent beings capable of pain and suffering is what allows exploitation to continue, and it won’t stop until we take action. Sign this petition to demand that the city of Los Angeles cancel the contract of the concessionaire and pass an ordinance banning pony rides!

4. Demand that the EPA cut air pollution

Given that climate change is real and fossil fuel-related emissions are the primary driver, we must take immediate action to cut greenhouse gasses. The IPCC has continually reminded the American public that we are running out of time, and we must demand that the Environmental Protection Agency take immediate and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Sign this petition to demand the Environmental Protection Agency take immediate action to cut air pollution!

5. Investigate Southern Baptist Leaders for sexual abuse

The Southern Baptist Church just released a previously secret list of pastors and church-affiliated employees who had been accused of sexual abuse after keeping it secret for more than a decade. The list includes over 700 case entries against hundreds of perpetrators. Powerful religious institutions have been covering up abuse over and over again, and we must ensure this never happens again. Sign this petition to demand the Department of Justice step in and investigate these heinous crimes!

6. Stop imprisoning women who have miscarriages!

In over half the country, it’s legal for prosecutors to charge women who miscarry with manslaughter. Brittney Poolaw, a 21-year-old member of the Comanche Nation in Oklahoma, was charged and convicted after miscarrying her four-month-old pregnancy. If Roe v. Wade is successfully overturned, the illegitimate assault on women’s reproductive rights will only worsen. Sign this petition to Tell states to stop imprisoning women who miscarry!

7. Impeach Justice Clarence Thomas for Lying Under Oath

Anita Hill, who is regarded as one of the most important figures in the fight against sexual harassment in the workplace, previously testified that former supreme court justice nominee Clarence Thomas — sexually harassed her. Thomas, under oath, denied the allegations. 30 years later, New York Magazine claims that even during the 1991 hearing, there was plenty of evidence that Thomas was, indeed, a sexual harasser and that he should be impeached for lying under oath. Sign this petition to demand that the House of Representatives impeach Judge Clarence Thomas for lying under oath.

8. Tell congress to pass affordable housing legislation

Research has repeatedly found that every single state in the country lacks decent affordable housing. On top of that, predatory companies like Zillow are literally buying up starter homes and immediately ramping up the prices to make a profit, Housing is a human right, and yet the overwhelming majority of Americans are struggling to make rent or mortgage payments. Sign this petition to demand Congress pass affordable housing legislation NOW!

9. Expel the Congressmen who tried to get Trump pardons for their role on Jan 6th!

"Air Pollutants, Especially From Traffic, Independently Increase Stroke Risk","Long-term exposure to air pollutants independently increases risk for stroke among older adults, according to a large, nationwide cohort study published in Global Epidemiology.

Worldwide, stroke is the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term disability. There has been mounting evidence that air pollution may influence stroke risk. As such, the World Health Organization and National Academy of Science have prioritized efforts to establish which air pollutants contribute more to risk.

The data from this study were sourced from the Medicare Chronic Conditions Warehouse, Medicare dominator file, and the Environmental Protection Agency, Air Quality Systems databases. Between 2000 and 2017, all Medicare beneficiaries (N=17,443,900) aged 65 years and older were evaluated for incidence of stroke and risk was related with exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm (PM 2.5 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and ground-level ozone (O 3 ). Pollutant exposure was predicted using an ensemble-based machine learning approach.

The study population was aged 65-74 years (88.2%), 58.2% were women, and 88.3% were White. During the study period, 12.8% (n=2,240,586) had an incident stroke.

Mean annual PM 2.5 exposure was 9.4 (standard deviation [SD], 3.7) μg/m3, NO 2 exposure was 17.5 (SD, 12.4) ppb, and warm-season O 3 was 42.8 (SD, 6.5) ppb. According to the EPA’s annual standards for PM 2.5 and NO 2 , 66% and 99% of the cohort was exposed to safe levels, respectively.

PM 2.5 exposure was highest in the eastern region and West Coast of the US, NO 2 was concentrated in urban centers, and warm-season O 3 was increased in the western region. The average annual ZIP code exposure levels were correlated between PM 2.5 and NO 2 (r, 0.38), PM 2.5 and O 3 (r, 0.28), and NO 2 and O 3 (r, 0.21).

After adjusting for potential covariates, long-term exposure to all 3 pollutants increased risk for incident stroke in all models. A 12.4 ppb elevation in mean annual NO 2 increased risk for stroke the following year (hazard ratio [HR], 1.073; 95% CI, 1.068-1.079). Similarly, an increased PM 2.5 level of 3.7 μg/m3 associated with a HR of 1.056 (95% CI, 1.051-1.061) and O 3 of 6.5 ppb a HR of 1.035 (95% CI, 1.031-1.039). Tri-pollutant models did not attenuate the relationship between pollutants and stoke risk.

The pollutant that had the strongest relationship with stroke was NO 2 . If exposure to NO 2 could be reduced by 12.4 ppb, an estimated 6% of strokes would be avoided.

In an effect modification analysis examining gender, race, Medicaid eligibility, age, neighborhood-level income, and education, all modifiers except race were robust in the single- and tri-pollutant models.

The major limitation of this study is the potential misestimation of exposure to pollutants.

The study authors noted that this study provided epidemiological evidence supporting the relationship between long-term exposure to pollutants with increased stroke risk.

“The strongest relationship we found with incident stroke was for NO2 among the 3 pollutants, suggesting that traffic-related air pollution may play a particularly significant role in increased risks of stroke,” researchers concluded.

"Plastic pollution vs food waste: When tackling both becomes a challenge, be mindful of what you put on your plate","iStock Packaging could be retired for food where it is not required.

MELBOURNE: Single-use plastic is a huge environmental problem, but it can help limit food waste - another big problem. Tackling both will take ingenuity.In 1970, Coca-Cola investigated the environmental impact of making reusable glass bottles and found single-use plastic bottles could be better in many contexts. It switched to plastic in the early 1990s.Plastic these days is framed as a problem to be solved. There is global momentum to ban plastic, particularly single-use packaging. The EU has issued directives, the UN Environment Assembly has committed to end plastic pollution and charitable organisations have formed global plastic pacts.The environmental impacts of proliferating plastic packaging are mounting, and there's evidence microplastic particles are ending up in human food, the effects on human health starting to garner attention.So it seems paradoxical that Coca-Cola could have chosen plastic on the basis of environmental values.The 1970 study used a method that these days is known as life cycle assessment. It measures materials, energy, waste and emissions at every step of the packaging's manufacture, use and disposal and attributes potential environmental impacts to them.For commercial reasons the full results of the Coke study were not published, but summaries released in 1976 said that shipping heavier reusable glass bottles and the resources required to maintain such systems meant single-use plastic bottles were usually preferable.Life cycle assessment is a powerful tool because of Its ability to compare impacts of different systems with interdependencies between inputs and outputs. The related industrial systems may have evolved since 1970, but the Coke example illustrates the method often challenges preconceptions of what the best environmental choice may be.A life cycle assessment is a good tool for investigating complex environmental trade-offs, particularly since one of the key industries that runs in parallel with single-use plastic, the food industry, connects to another global problem: food loss and waste.According to UN data, 20 to 30 percent of food produced is wasted. If global food waste and loss were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases on Earth.The energy that has gone into growing the food, the supply-chain fuels and energy, and the greenhouse gases emitted when food rots are key contributors to this stunning statistic. Somewhat counter-intuitively, life cycle assessments of single-use plastics and food waste can show climate-change impacts of wasting food can dwarf those of packaging.Packaging is designed for a range of purposes. Good packaging helps extend shelf life by protecting food from bumps, heat and cold, various spoiling gases and light. Often this is done across land, sea and air, as our supply chains become global and more complicated.Packaging also plays a role in helping conserve food once it's in homes. Moisture-reduction sachets, resealable zips, information on the pack to advise on correct storage, 'best before' or 'use by' dates, and sophisticated technologies such as barrier properties or gas scavengers all serve to keep food at its best.Consumers often don't recognise the purpose, or benefits, of packaging in terms of preventing food waste.If reducing packaging leads to more food waste, a nuanced and sophisticated approach is required to consider these twin issues. Ultimately, the best option for the environment is to reduce both excess packaging and food waste.In Australia, 2025 targets to make packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable are gaining momentum. They are loosely in alignment with related European movements. Such an approach does not just involve packaging design and manufacture; end-of-life systems also need to be ready for these changes, or else all those design efforts will be for naught.Education can encourage consumers to recycle, reuse and compost effectively. In the past, consumers have shown they can learn new programmes for managing their waste and scholars have spent considerable time analysing which education strategies are the most effective.Packaging could be retired for food where it is not required. UK charity WRAP recently released a study explaining where there may be opportunities to reduce packaging on a range of fresh-produce categories.Where packaging is still needed to reduce food waste due to elongated supply chains or highly perishable goods, then making it recyclable, reusable or compostable may help reduce end-of-life plastic problems.Educating consumers about the role packaging plays in reducing food waste and how to make sure packaging is recouped in a circular system would likely need to go hand in hand with this approach so consumers become active agents for change.If the world moved towards a zero-packaging scenario across the board, the whole supply chain and the way humans as a society relate to food would need a transformational rethink.Without moving to a distributed system of production and supply, the goal of zero packaging would be difficult to achieve. The sheer distance involved and time required to ship food - particularly highly perishable fresh produce - from centralised farms in a condition fit to eat make this nearly impossible.Perhaps in the future micro farms will be established across metropolises. As the technology develops, these sites might consist of urban indoor or vertical farming to maximise control, volume and efficiency in small or dense spaces.Likewise, people may need to revert to eating produce in season and buying it closer to the time of harvest. Or perhaps industry will engineer a way to produce food out of season in micro farms, or produce crops with more resilience to being unpackaged.Such attributes would likely require bioengineering, climate control and nutrient dosing, and immense 'smarts', sites and resources.The move to a fully circular economy - where organic waste is processed in cities adjacent to urban farms to 'feed' the system and repeat the cycle - may help. Clearly, a range of other issues would need to be addressed and actions taken in concert with such visions of the future.Humans have transformed cities before. Rome, the thriving capital of modern Italy, is famously built on the ruins of the Rome of millennia past.It's possible that compounding environmental problems and life cycle assessment of the damage already done may force humankind into a future more radical than an ordinary plastic Coke bottle could ever have presaged.(The article has been syndicated by PTI via 360info.org)",,[],[]
Pollution: Study links bad air quality to heart rhythm disorder,"Share on Pinterest High levels of air pollution could worsen the symptoms of some health conditions. Getty Images Researchers decided to explore the connection between heart health and air pollution after seeing that more heart patients made emergency room visits on days of bad air quality.

They found that the risk of abnormal heartbeats (ventricular arrhythmias) was raised even on days when the average air quality was slightly degraded.

The study’s authors recommend that people with implanted defibrillation devices keep an eye on daily pollution levels and plan their exposure accordingly. An implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) does more than reset a heart’s rhythm to a healthy beat. It also provides researchers with a way of monitoring the occurrence of arrhythmias, or abnormal heartbeats, in hopes of identifying what factors are likely to trigger one. New research, presented at the European Society of Cardiology’s (ESC) Heart Failure 2022 congress, compared days on which patients experienced higher numbers of ventricular arrhythmias with days scientists recorded higher levels of air pollution. The researchers found a correlation: The days with high levels of air pollution were when most arrhythmias occurred. Dr. Franco Folino, of the Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences at the University of Padova, Italy, told Medical News Today about the value of ICDs for research. “These devices, as well as many pacemakers, are formidable devices not only for the treatment of arrhythmias but also for their ability to monitor heart rhythm 24 hours a day. Therefore, they represent an ideal tool for comparing arrhythmic profiles with data from the monitoring station for air quality,” he said. However, Dr. Folino, who was not involved in the study, noted that the patients observed may be at a higher risk of pollution-related health problems. “The research conducted on patients with ICDs, who are implanted in patients with major heart diseases, explore a population at high cardiovascular risk, highlighting that in these subjects the effects of pollution are even more pronounced,” he pointed out.

Monitoring air quality in Italy The study took place in the city of Piacenza in the Emilia Romagna region of northern Italy. In 2021, in a ranking by the European Environment Agency of European cities with the greatest levels of air pollution, Piacenza ranked near the bottom—just 16 cities were comparatively worse. The average annual concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 in Piacenza was listed as 20.8 μg/m3. The World Health Organization considers a level of 5 μg/m3 of PM 2.5 or less to be good air quality . Piacenza landed squarely in the WHO’s “poor” air quality category. Dr. Alessia Zanni, a cardiovascular technician-technologist and author of the study, tells the ESC: “We had observed that emergency room visits for arrhythmias in patients with ICDs tended to cluster on days with particularly high air pollution. We, therefore, decided to compare the concentration of air pollutants on days when patients had an arrhythmia versus pollution levels on days without an arrhythmia.”

How ICDs work Dr. Zanni explained to MNT that implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy is currently the only prevention tool for potentially fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). “The difference [between the two conditions] is that during VT, the heart can still pump some blood and the patient could still be conscious, while during VF the heart is almost still, causing a cardiac arrest,” she said. She then went on to explain the pacing-or-shock mechanism behind ICDs. “An ICD is capable of terminating ventricular arrhythmias by anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP), shock, or both. ATP is used for VT and tries to pace the heart faster than the arrhythmia in order to block the pathological circuit, take the lead of the heart rhythm, and then slow down the pacing until a normal heart rate is obtained,” she said. Dr. Zanni said ICDs managed to stop ventricular tachycardia in approximately 90% of patients. Where it fails, the shock system kicks in: “If the ATP fails, or a VF occurs, the ICD delivers a high-voltage shock that immediately stop the arrhythmia. Usually, ATP is not perceived by the patient, while the shock can be felt, even violently.”

Linking air pollution and ICD activity The study tracked the ICD activity in 146 individuals who had received an implant between January 2013 and December 2017. Of this group, 67 people had experienced a previous ventricular arrhythmia, and 79 had not. The Regional Environmental Agency provided the researchers with daily figures for PM 2.5, PM 10, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). During the study, the researchers recorded 440 ventricular arrhythmias. ATP sufficed for 322 of these, while ICDs delivered a shock in 118 cases. The study found that every 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 levels corresponded with a 1.5% increased risk of arrhythmias requiring a shock. When PM 2.5 concentrations remained elevated by 1 μg/m3 over the course of a week, ventricular arrhythmias were 2.4% more frequent. For PM 10 concentrations, a weekly increase by the same amount corresponded to 2.1% more ventricular arrhythmias.",,[],[]
"New, Stronger Rules for Truck Pollution Still Would Not Meet Air Quality Goals","CLIMATEWIRE | EPA’s proposal to limit toxic pollution from heavy-duty trucks is stronger than anything that has come before it. But state and local air quality agencies say it’s not aggressive enough to meet the federal regulator’s own clean air standards.

The National Association of Clean Air Agencies — which represents 115 local air pollution control agencies across 41 states, four territories and the District of Columbia — estimates that more than a third of the U.S. population lives in an area that does not meet federal air quality standards. One of the reasons: truck traffic.

Now, as EPA moves to limit heavy-duty truck emissions, it is also creating stricter standards for particle air pollution. But the NACAA says the draft truck rule is too weak to help states meet current air quality standards, let alone the new ones.

“EPA is ratcheting up the number of areas that aren’t meeting health-based air quality standards at the same time they’re proposing a rule that isn’t protective enough for the most important source of that exact pollution,” said Miles Keogh, NACAA executive director.

Heavy-duty trucks are the largest mobile source of nitrogen oxides, which can react in the atmosphere to form toxic pollutants like ozone and particulate matter. While states can reduce emissions from stationary sources like power plants and factories, they largely lack the authority to regulate emissions from cars and trucks, which fall under the purview of the federal government.

That means without a federal rule to sufficiently curb NOx emissions from 18-wheelers, delivery vans and dump trucks, states are running out of ways to come into compliance with air quality standards, analysts say.

“In the 1970s there were more opportunities for emissions reductions because we had not yet started to reduce emissions,” said Julian Marshall, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Washington. “But the easy stuff has already been addressed, so the number of [pollution] sources they can control is getting smaller and smaller.”

EPA last updated its federal standards for NOx emissions from heavy-duty trucks 20 years ago, during which time the public’s health suffered. Exposure to toxic air pollution is linked to a host of ailments, including heightened risk of early death and poor lung development in children. Transportation is also the single-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country.

Communities of color and low-income neighborhoods have borne the brunt of that pollution, as they are disproportionately located near highways, freight corridors, rail yards and warehouses, according to EPA.

President Joe Biden has pledged to address these disparities, in part by updating emission standards for heavy-duty trucks. But EPA’s proposed rule, which was released in March, came as a disappointment to environmental and public health experts who had hoped for a stronger regulation (Climatewire, April 14).

Along with advocates living and working in these heavily polluted areas, the experts urged EPA to issue a truck rule in line with California’s recently enacted Heavy-Duty Omnibus program, which requires a 90 percent reduction in NOx emissions by 2027 compared to 2010 standards.

EPA’s proposal outlined two approaches. The first option mirrors California’s rule, but is not as strong. The second, less stringent option is more in line with what truck- and engine-makers have pushed for (Greenwire, March 8).

""This administration has put addressing racial inequities as a priority,"" said Ray Minjares, who heads the International Council on Clean Transportation’s heavy-duty vehicles program. ""And we’re just not seeing that in this rule.""

Community members have continued to meet with EPA staffers at least once a month, but say they feel overlooked (Climatewire, May 16).

Meanwhile, EPA is slated to propose stronger particulate matter limits this summer, after an advisory panel delivered a pivotal review recommending the agency tighten both annual and daily exposure limits (Greenwire, March 22). While EPA has no plans to tighten NOx limits in their own right, those criteria pollutants are one of the major contributors to particulate matter as well as ozone.

“EPA’s rule as proposed really leaves people up the river as far as getting those NOx reductions,” Keogh said. “Our agencies can’t squeeze it out of the sources we’ve got, and we need the feds to set a sufficiently protective standard for these trucks.”

In Phoenix, Ariz., for example, smoke stacks are few and far between, Keogh said.

“That haze over the mountains is coming from mobile sources,” he said. “It’s coming from cars and trucks.”

Another example can be found in Wisconsin, where there are several areas that do not meet federal air quality standards. The largest contributor of NOx emissions in Wisconsin comes from vehicles traveling in and through the state. And nearly half of those emissions come from heavy-duty trucks, according to the 2017 National Emissions Inventory.

EPA spokesperson Taylor Gillespie pointed out that the agency’s truck rule is a proposal, not a final regulation.

“We had an extended comment period for people to weigh in and provide feedback which just closed last week,” she said in an email. “We are currently reviewing those comments and look forward to addressing concerns in the coming months.”

Gillespie also noted the rule is the first phase of the agency’s broader plan to address pollution from trucks.

Cleaner air, but ‘disparities remain’

While researchers and those affected have long understood the health consequences of living and working in the shadow of the heavy-duty trucking industry, new research has increasingly laid bare the systemic nature of the disparities.

A study published this year in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters found a correlation between redlining — a discriminatory mortgage appraisal practice from the 1930s — and air pollution levels in Black neighborhoods.

“This is what many communities have been saying for decades, that the risks from air pollution are not felt equally across members of our society,” said Marshall, who co-authored the study. “And ethically, that’s almost its own separate reason to care about air pollution. There’s this fairness aspect to it.”

Marshall said one reason for the disparity is because in the 1960s the federal government routed freeways directly, and often intentionally, through Black and low-income neighborhoods — a historical wrong the Biden administration has said it wants to help remedy (Climatewire, Dec. 8, 2021).

Another study published last year in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that early in the Covid-19 pandemic, overall levels of toxic pollution decreased the most in Black, Latino and low-income neighborhoods as people stopped driving to work.

But those communities still experienced higher levels of pollution compared to the levels majority white and affluent areas faced even prior to the pandemic. That’s in part because while passenger vehicle traffic decreased during the pandemic, heavy-duty trucking did not.

Similarly, in a draft policy assessment for its particulate matter rulemaking, EPA staff found that Black communities would experience proportionally greater benefits from stricter particulate matter air quality standards, but they would still face higher rates of premature mortality risks from toxic pollution compared to other groups.

“Over time, the air has gotten cleaner, yet the disparities remain,” Marshall said. “So we really need to look for opportunities, like with diesel emissions, to find the sources that lead to some groups being more exposed than others and address those sources.”

EPA is slated to release its final truck emissions rule before the end of the year.

Experts Discuss How Light and Noise Pollution Affect Animal Senses,"Modern contaminants have a tremendous impact on how animals perceive their surroundings. Experts debate the effect of light and noise pollution on animal senses.

Light Pollution

All life on Earth has relied on the Earth's consistent day-night cycle for billions of years. All plants and animals have it encoded in their DNA. By lighting up the night, we have completely interrupted this cycle.

Plants and animals rely on the Earth's daily cycle of light and shade to regulate life-sustaining behaviors, including reproduction, nutrition, sleep, and predator defense.

Many animals, including amphibians, birds, mammals, insects, and plants, are thought to be negatively affected by artificial light at night, according to scientific data.

Light Pollution Affecting Animals and Plants

Artificial light harms the environment.

Nocturnal animals are active at night and sleep during the day. By turning night into day, light pollution drastically changes their overnight habitat.

""The advent of artificial light arguably constitutes the most profound adjustment human beings have made to their surroundings,"" according to study scientist Christopher Kyba.

""Predators utilize light for hunting, while prey species use darkness for concealment,"" says Kyba. ""Cloudy skies around cities are now hundreds, if not thousands, of times brighter than they were 200 years ago."" We're only now beginning to understand the magnitude of the impact on nighttime ecology.""

Artificial light glare can influence wetland ecosystems that are home to amphibians like frogs and toads, whose nocturnal croaking is part of their mating process. Artificial lights interfere with reproduction and population reduction by disrupting nighttime activities.

Noise Pollution

Noise pollution is an unseen threat to the health and well-being of all living things. In this series of posts, we'll look at how noise pollution impacts wildlife, humans, and the environment.

Noise pollution, commonly referred to as environmental noise or sound pollution, is any undesired or irritating sound that negatively influences human or animal behavior. Although it is an unseen threat, it is very much present in our daily lives.

Effects of Man-Made Pollution

Human-made noise can harm animals, according to a report published by Queen's University Belfast in the journal 'Biology Letters.'

Over a hundred species were examined in this study and split into seven categories: amphibians, arthropods, birds, fish, mammals, mollusks, and reptiles. The research was based on tests that captured several elements of the animals' behavior before and after noise exposure.

The findings revealed that noise pollution influenced all seven species groupings, with no differences in their responses to noise.

Evolutionary Adaptation

Evolutionary adaptation, or simply adaptation, is the process through which organisms adapt to their surroundings to enhance their chances of survival.

Living creatures adjust to their surroundings. This means their appearance, behavior, structure, or style of existence renders them fit to survive and reproduce in their environments. Giraffes, for example, have incredibly long necks to allow them to consume lofty plants that other animals cannot reach. Cats' eyes are shaped like slits. The cat's eyes can adjust to brilliant light when the slits are small and very low light when the slits are wide open.

Unable to Adapt

Unfortunately, due to certain biological limitations, not many organisms can rapidly adapt to a rapidly modernizing environment; among the things hindering these creatures are the harms that light and noise pollution brings.

"As Saginaw Bay pollution grows, farmers urge other farmers to change ways","They hope that shop talk between farmers can succeed where other tactics — such as prodding from government officials or payments through conservation programs — failed to convert more farmers to practices that preserve soil and protect waterways.

“We want the message of soil health, and soil health farming, to spread more like a wildfire,” said Ben Wickerham, a Saginaw Bay projects manager with The Nature Conservancy, a global environmental group. “The best way to do that is through peer networks.”

Waning topsoil and polluted water

Much of the nutrient-laden runoff that pollutes Saginaw Bay — the area of Lake Huron that separates Michigan’s Thumb from the rest of the Lower Peninsula — comes from soil that erodes off the landscape when rain or wind collide with loose soil.

“On a micro scale, a raindrop hitting a plowed field is a bomb that throws soil in the air,” said Joe Kelpinski, a program manager with the Michgian Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

Though the rate of cropland soil erosion has slowed over the decades, federal officials estimate that Michigan farms continue to lose more than 2.5 tons from the average acre every year. Some researchers estimate that’s a dramatic undercount.

While tilling fields can help control weeds and loosen soil for easier planting, it degrades and dries out soil, hastening erosion. That reduces crop yields, costing Midwest farmers about $3 billion a year, according to a University of Massachusetts study. It can trigger a vicious cycle: Farmers offset the loss of nutrient-rich soil by turning to commercial fertilizer, which then further pollutes waterways as it runs off farm fields and into rivers.

The Saginaw Bay is just one casualty.

After years of battles over how best to manage pollution that fuels nuisance algae blooms, excessive plant growth and mucky beaches, the state this year declared the inner bay “impaired” in paperwork filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. That means the bay failed to meet Clean Water Act standards, and government regulators must now craft a plan to fix the problem.

Kevin Goodwin, an aquatic biologist with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, said state officials will soon create a nutrient pollution budget for the watershed, known as a Total Maximum Daily Load.

Though many environmentalists question whether Michigan can address farm pollution without more tightly regulating agriculture, Goodwin said EGLE has no plans for new farm regulations to enforce forthcoming pollution limits in Saginaw Bay. Still, the impairment designation adds urgency to efforts to curb key polluters, such as farms and wastewater plants.

Because keeping topsoil intact is a shared concern of farmers and clean water advocates, it is often “the fundamental starting place” for conversations about how to rein in farm pollution, said TNC’s Wickerham.

Cover crops (plants such as clover or ryegrass, grown mainly to cover the soil between harvests), reduced tilling, streamside vegetation buffers and other tactics can help preserve topsoil and prevent polluted runoff. But long-standing mistrust and fear of regulations can make for unproductive conversations between conservation workers and farmers.

Laura Johnson, a water quality researcher and director of the National Center for Water Quality Research at Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio, has spent years studying farm pollution in the algae-plagued western Lake Erie Basin. She has seen mistrust bubble up when government or university officials are the ones pushing farmers to innovate.

“They’re like, ‘you should be doing this, that and the other on your fields,’” Johnson said. “Sometimes to farmers it seems unattainable, or complicated, or like, what do you know about my fields?”

Enter Tait.

Angling for a culture shift

Just before the pandemic, Tait and another area farmer began hosting their neighbors at occasional gatherings of a farmer-led watershed group, where they spread the gospel of soil conservation.

Over cups of coffee or during gatherings in their fields, he shared how he has managed to move beyond conventional practices on his farm, while remaining profitable.

“I’m not the leader in it,” Tait said of his progressive farming practices. “But in this area? Maybe.”",,[],[]
4 Factors Affecting Air Pollution in California,"For many years, California topped the US rankings as the state with the worst air quality. We explore the causes behind it and to what extent the state and federal laws and regulations passed in recent decades have contributed to tackling the issue of air pollution in California.

—

Every year for more than two decades, the American Lung Association has conducted extensive research on the air quality across the US to compile the State of the Air report. The latest edition, published in 2022, revealed that more than four in 10 Americans – equivalent to over 137 million people – live in places with unhealthy levels of particle pollution or ozone. This number has grown by almost 12 million in just six years, a clear indicator that the situation is rapidly worsening. Moreover, the report found that in 2021, several areas across the country were impacted by daily spikes in deadly particle pollution, and had the highest number of days with ‘very unhealthy’ and ‘hazardous’ air quality ever recorded.

Figure 1: Spikes in Air Pollution in the US, 2015-2020

According to the study, California leads the rankings for urban areas with the worst air quality. Among the 25 worst cities for both daily and year-round particle pollution, numbers 9 are Californian cities respectively. The worst-performing are Bakersfield – located in the Kern County – and the Fresno-Madera-Hanford metropolitan area. Los Angeles was ranked top out of 226 metropolitan areas for high ozone days.

Unsurprisingly, air pollution in California results in thousands of fatalities each year. A 2021 study conducted by the Environmental Defence Fund and George Washington University estimates that exposure to particle pollution led to more than 3,000 deaths and nearly 5,500 new childhood asthma cases across the California Bay Area, while exposure to nitrogen dioxide generated from vehicles killed more than 2,500 people. Overall, however, air pollution is responsible for a much higher number of deaths, which in the state averages 10,000 every year.

From vehicular emissions and fossil fuel production to prolonged wildfire seasons due to climate change, there are many sources of pollution that contribute to such an unhealthy air quality in California.

1. Transportation

Arguably one of the biggest sources of harmful emissions in California is the transportation industry, which currently accounts for approximately 40% of the state’s atmospheric pollution. The state, particularly Los Angeles, and its surrounding areas have a high concentration of vehicles; more than one every two people own a car, which explains the severe and declining air quality. LA is notorious for its urban traffic congestion and, not surprisingly, the leading city on the most ozone-polluted list as well.

However, the state recently adopted some of the nation’s strictest regulations for vehicles, which contributed to a drastic decrease in emissions in recent years and paved the way for other states to follow. To target personal vehicular emissions, many California cities are now increasing public transportation infrastructure. The government is also encouraging residents to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) by offering tax breaks and other financial incentives while expanding its network of charging stations. And, as numbers show, these efforts are paying off. In 2021 alone, EVs represented 12.4% of all vehicle sales, placing the state as the undisputable US market leader. Furthermore, California has almost 35,000 charging stations, by far the highest number across the country. Under a new proposal from the state’s clean air regulator, zero-emissions cars would make up to 35% of new passenger vehicle sales by 2026, 58% by 2030, and 100% by 2035, when a complete ban on gas-fuelled vehicles is set to come into force.

California is also home to one of the busiest and largest container ports in the Western Hemisphere – the Port of Los Angeles – as well as 12 airports with major cargo operations. But while these commercial activities account for nearly a third of the state’s economy, they are also responsible for half of its air pollution. In 2020 California adopted new, stricter emission standards for diesel trucks, oil tankers, and other ships in a bid to tackle the rising smog. These new rules – some of the most stringent in the last decade – are expected to eliminate some 10,000 tons of emissions per year.

2. Wildfires

The hot and dry climate makes California extremely prone to wildfires. With climate change aggravating and sparking a rise in temperatures as well as in drought conditions, these events have gotten more frequent, intense, and destructive in the past two decades.

Despite being just a temporary source of emissions, their impact on monthly and yearly air pollution is still quite severe. Indeed, some of the highest levels of pollution in the atmosphere are recorded in areas mostly affected by wildfires. This was proved in 2019 when 19 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the United States were located in California, the state by far mostly affected by severe fires that season. And again in 2020 – a record-setting year for wildfires in the Pacific West – the state experienced extremely unhealthy air quality levels, with major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco recording numerous days with exceptionally high levels of air pollution.

3. Heatwaves

In the most recent State of the Air report, the Golden State holds all top four cities in the country for worst ozone, and experts agree that extreme heat is the main contributor. Ozone generates when warm temperatures and abundant sunshine – for which the Californian coast is known – bake nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. For this reason, ozone levels are usually higher in summer.

Despite other countries in the US also being affected by heatwaves each year, California’s geology is what makes it particularly vulnerable to these weather events. Some of the state’s most populous cities – such as Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco – are located near mountain ranges, which trap the air moved easterly from sea breezes, facilitating the accumulation of pollution in the coastal valleys.

Another interesting finding from the report is that the impact of pollution from extreme heat is not shared equally. As a 2021 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found, the combination of bad heat and bad air can cause particularly dangerous conditions for vulnerable communities across California, increasing physical and mental stress among poor, under-resourced, and often non-white zip codes. The main explanation for this trend is that poorer people tend to live on the outskirts of cities, where the confluence of emissions from nearby industrial activities and major roadways mean significantly higher air pollution and thus greater health risks. The study also highlighted the fact that California’s environmental regulations have systematically protected the state’s white residents over people of colour.

4. Energy Sources

Unsurprisingly, the level of air pollution depends to a great extent on the energy sources used to generate a state’s electricity and run its infrastructure and economy. In May 2022, California reached a milestone by generating enough renewable power to meet 103% of consumer demand in just a day, a sign of the state’s remarkable progress in terms of clean energy. In 2018, Governor Jerry Brown issued an Executive Order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045 and maintain net negative emissions thereafter. To do this, California is increasing investments in renewable energy, particularly solar. Given its vast land and abundance of sunshine, this is clearly a key resource that will help the state reach its target. Other forms of renewable power, including wind, geothermal, biomass, and hydroelectric are being utilised as well. However, some problems persist.

Hydropower, for example, is highly affected by the persistent droughts that are drying up water resources in the country. These events, experts predict, could cut energy generation in half this coming summer, which would result in an increase in natural gas-fired power and higher electricity prices. And while solar panels are able to meet energy demand on some days, gas power plants are still running in California, providing about 10% of the state’s electricity. Furthermore, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2021, a record-breaking year for renewables in California, the state was still the seventh-largest producer of crude oil as well as the largest and second-largest consumer of jet fuel and motor gasoline respectively in the country.",,[],[]
"To combat pollution and its inequalities, European citizens are calling for the “right to clean air” for all","Since the death, at the age of nine, of her daughter Ella, the first officially recognised fatal victim of air pollution, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah has become a tireless defender of the right to clean air. London, March 2022.

Although Jo Barnes has been working on air quality for almost 20 years, it was only in the mid-2010s that this professor at the University of the West of England in the UK saw the emergence of a public debate on the social inequalities created by pollution. In other words, is clean air, that universal good par excellence, as equally distributed as it seems? In 2003, a pioneering study in the UK suggested that it was not. Jo Barnes and her colleagues went on to confirm “the presence of social inequality and environmental injustice” – the poor are often more exposed to pollution than the wealthy, and more vulnerable to its effects, even though they generate less. Linked to urban planning, housing and transport policies, it is a complex phenomenon that can be found in many European countries.

In the United States, these inequalities have contributed to the emergence of an environmental justice movement that has been active for some 30 years. In Europe, where air pollution with the finest particles is estimated by the European Environment Agency to cause up to 400,000 premature deaths per year and countless respiratory, cardiac and other illnesses, the debate is only just beginning. The European Commission’s Zero Pollution Plan points out that people “living in more precarious socio-economic conditions” suffer more than others, but the observation is slow to be translated into action. In France for example, anti-pollution measures are “too often applied uniformly across the country, whereas differences in vulnerability should be taken into account,” points out Séverine Deguen, a researcher who took part in Equit’Area, the first French research project on pollution and social injustice.

The struggle of a handful of parents from the Anatole-France school complex in the city of Saint-Denis, in the Paris region, is one of the rare examples of mobilisation on this issue in France. The levels of the main pollutants where this school stands, in one of the poorest communes in the country, already range between “bad” and “very worrying”, according to the measurements taken by associations. And with the works for the Paris Olympics in 2024, the school is going to be trapped between two huge motorways. “It makes no sense,” says Hamid Ouidir, father of two schoolchildren. “We’ll end up with 10,000 to 20,000 cars a day on each side.” His struggle to press the authorities to overturn the decision is cited as an example in a 2021 UNICEF report on the overexposure of poor children to pollution. But Hamid Ouidir is one of the few people to take it public. “The campaign is not really taking off,” he admits, attributing the low level of mobilisation to the resignation of the local residents and to conflicts of interest between health issues and economic development.

From the UK to Romania, mothers lead the fight

Some countries are making more headway. In the UK, there is renewed interest in air pollution and its inequalities, much of it thanks to Rosamund Kissi-Debrah. This Londoner fought to have the death of her daughter Ella, who died in 2013 from an asthma attack at the age of nine, attributed to pollution. The family was living in Lewisham, a borough that is in the 20 per cent of the most deprived local authorities in England. The family’s home is adjacent to the very busy South Circular Road. At the end of 2020, Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah became the first person whose death was officially linked to air pollution by a coroner. She is the only fatal victim with a name and a face.

Rosamund Kissi-Debrah has since become a tireless campaigner for the right to clean air. She has been lobbying organisations and politicians moved by her story to have the World Health Organization (WHO) pollution limits enshrined in law. She also reaches out to fellow citizens. When we meet her in a Lewisham café, she uses the opportunity to call out to customers with their babies in arms: “Do you know that the pollution in our neighbourhood is threatening the health of our children?”

“Mothers,” she tells Equal Times, “like all those who care for children, are powerful mobilisers. I wish they realised the power they have.”

Kissi-Debrah shares this conviction with Mums for Lungs. This British association is fighting for ‘school streets’, pedestrianised zones near schools. Children themselves are more vulnerable to pollution and are potential activists.

In 2021, a group of teenagers, including one of Ella’s classmates, launched Choked Up, a campaign to alert the public to the health and social dangers of dirty air.

“Breathing kills. People of colour are more likely to live in an area with illegal pollution levels,” read signs posted around London. Around 100 doctors have backed them by writing to London mayoral candidates. Choked Up also teamed up with the Labour Party to release a study that found a correlation between the most polluted areas of London and those with the highest levels of child poverty.

We find ourselves 2,000 kilometres from London, in Cluj Napoca, one of Romania’s main cities. “This is our youngest activist,” says Stoica Maria Rozalia, nursing her five-week-old baby. Since she was five years old and her family was evicted from the city centre, Maria has lived in Pata Rat, a Roma neighbourhood of around 1,500 people set up on a landfill site. In a 2020 report, the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) called Pata Rat “Europe’s largest waste-related ghetto” and denounced the “environmental racism”. As a community facilitator, Maria Rozalia deals with administrative documents, organises activities for children and fights for access to drinking water and clean air. The fumes from the waste, and the proximity of the airport and major roads contribute to the high levels of pollution in the area. Most mothers see their children developing health problems when they start playing outside, at around age two or three.

Valuable support from scientists

“The illnesses I see most often are asthma and infections, such as tonsillitis,” says Bogdan Mincu, a Romanian pulmonologist. The doctor is doing his best to document the problem. In 2021, in association with the Desire Foundation, which is committed to combating social injustice and housing problems, Mincu conducted a study on health in Pata Rat – 83 per cent of the respondents said their children had needed medical care in the 12 previous months; 50 per cent admitted to having a daily cough; and most said they were “aware of the pollution”. The study found levels of fine particles exceeding the recommended thresholds. The same is true for hydrogen sulphide, a toxic gas that causes a bad odour, nausea and dry eyes and throat.

Scientists are playing a crucial role in supporting citizens’ struggles. By cross-referencing Ella’s asthma attacks with pollution data, immunologist Stephen Holgate convinced the authorities of a causal link in the UK. In Rybnik, a Polish city considered to be one of the most polluted in the EU, several studies have shaken up public opinion. This Upper Silesian city is known for its coal mines, but the pollution is also caused by domestic heating. In 2019, Monika Glosowitz’s three-year-old son participated in a study by the Belgian researcher Tim Nawrot.

The results showed that the urine of children in Rybnik contained three to nine times more black carbon, a toxic substance, than their counterparts in Strasbourg, France.

The team of Katarzyna Musioł, an oncologist and the medical director of the Rybnik hospital, also revealed that children in the city are more prone to brain tumours than those in other parts of Poland. The doctor has also observed a deterioration in their mental health – depression, concentration and behavioural problems – which she links to smog.

This research has helped build collective consciousness, according to Glosowitz. In 2021, after six years of struggle, a citizen of Rybnik won what he considers to be a ground-breaking victory. Oliwer Palarz, co-founder of Rybnik Smog Alert, was awarded €6,500 after a court ruled that his rights to health and freedom had been violated by pollution. Palarz hopes that other citizens will follow. But most residents are forced to take individual measures. Glosowitz has installed air purifiers and stays at home with her windows closed when the app measuring pollution shows high levels. She is able to stay indoors and work from home when the air quality outside is too bad, but not everyone can.

In recent years, some Polish provinces have taken steps to ban ageing coal-fired boilers. In Rybnik, the local government has created a number of public subsidies, some of which are available on an income-adjusted basis, to help households change their equipment. Since the beginning of 2022, those who do not comply will be fined. Time will tell whether the measure is sufficient to reduce the levels of pollution, the thresholds of which have hitherto been exceeded on 120 to 130 days a year.

Giving a voice to those most affected

In Romania, local authorities, including the Cluj Napoca City Hall, which did not respond to our interview requests, have created a programme that has already helped resettle some Roma in the city. Maria Rozalia hopes to benefit from it. But the Desire Foundation remains sceptical about the promise to relocate Pata Rat residents by 2030. Activists suspect that the politicians’ motives have more to do with the construction of a state-of-the-art complex, Transylvania Smart City, near the dump. “The authorities are more driven by financial incentives than human suffering,” sighs Mincu. The pulmonologist would like to convince them that fighting pollution also has economic benefits. “A child suffering from respiratory diseases has a high chance of suffering from COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] or pulmonary fibrosis in 40 years,” he warns. “Preventing them now means avoiding huge costs in the future.”

From her office in Bristol, British researcher Jo Barnes insists that air quality and social justice policies should not be top down but thought out and implemented with the communities concerned. Firstly, because certain environmental measures can penalise the most vulnerable by for example requiring them to give up short-term polluting equipment such as cars and boilers, without an alternative being offered. But also because some decisions increase the pollution suffered by poor households, for example by shifting traffic from city centres to the outskirts, where less privileged residents often live.

In Bristol, Residents Against Dirty Energy (RADE) wants to make their voices heard. The initiative was launched in Easton, a working-class neighbourhood affected by creeping gentrification and an environmental culture clash, according to Stuart Phelps, one of its organisers.

On the one hand, there are families who depend on cars for work – many are taxi drivers or work in warehouses that are inaccessible by bike – but otherwise pollute little. On the other hand, there are the well-to-do young people who are anti-car but who are fuelling the latest trend of wood burning stoves, which are extremely harmful to the air.

But, Phelps points out, it is the white middle and upper classes that are setting the environmental agenda. “The measures prioritised are the banning of polluting vehicles such as vans, and the development of cycle paths. No one is thinking of banning wood burning stoves or developing a network of affordable buses that fit in with factory hours.”

To involve Bristol residents in the fight against dirty air, RADE Bristol has set up a citizen air pollution measurement network, in partnership with several universities, the Council of Bristol Mosques and even the European Space Agency, which has provided a sensor. The data is collected and processed during introductory workshops in computer code and data visualisation organised for local children. They then relay the results to their families. In this street art city, artists have painted a mural to raise awareness of the health issues surrounding pollution. One of these painters, Aumairah Hassan, has co-created Cycling Sisters, a group that helps women, particularly those facing cultural or religious barriers, learn how to cycle.

These projects should gain real political traction with their inclusion in two neighbourhood forums, citizens’ organisations that local authorities have to consult regarding planning. At a national level, Boris Johnson’s government is also completing a consultation with researchers and citizens on how to tackle inequalities in its new clean air strategy. For Jo Barnes, if not a revolution, it is a sign of growing awareness.",,[],[]
South Africa’s estuaries face a growing threat from pollution: we took a close look at four,"In the popular imagination, estuaries don’t have the prestige or the romanticism of their two constituent parts: the rivers that feed them with freshwater from one side, the ocean that injects salty water from the other.

But as the go-between between river and ocean, estuaries nonetheless deserve more credit. Their dull, brackish appearance belies the abundance of life that they hold. Considered as, pound for pound, among the most productive environments on earth, they are said to produce more organic matter than forests or grasslands of the same size. With little of the violent movements of water associated with oceans and rivers, they hold few predators. As a result, they shelter and offer respite to countless species of birds, fish and mammals.

They are economic powerhouses, too. They’ve been described as “super” ecosystems. And, in the case of South Africa, although they comprise less than 2% of the country’s territory, they’re estimated to contribute R4.2 billion per annum (around US$4.2 million) to the country’s economy.

A 2020 report pointed out that as many as 80 species caught in linefishery rely on South Africa’s nearly 300 estuaries for their feeding, refuge and reproduction.

In addition, estuaries are valued for their capacity as “blue carbon” sinks. This refers to the ability of coastal mangrove forests, salt marshes and seagrasses to store carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, mitigating the effects of climate change.

However, estuaries are vastly understudied which means that we know little of the harm that we as humans are doing to them.

To help make up for this gap in our knowledge about the nearly 300 estuaries in South Africa, we have increasingly begun to look at microplastic pollution in a selection of these estuaries. Our work is in collaboration with colleagues from University of KwaZulu Natal.

Our findings in a recent study show that South African estuaries could be considered to be moderately to highly polluted in comparison with microplastic levels in countries such as Singapore, China and even the UK. We conclude that urgent action needs to be taken to reduce pollution of these precious waterways.

Mapping microplastic levels

Much of the research on microplastic pollution focuses on oceans and beaches. This overlooks the location of estuaries, sitting at the interface between terrestrial and ocean environments. As such, they store both land- and sea-based macro and microplastics – which animals may consume – and transport large amounts of plastic and other debris from the rivers to the ocean.

Microplastics are defined as fragments of plastics less than 5mm in length, typically small pieces of plastic that remains as they break down into every smaller pieces. Plastics, of course, can take hundreds or even thousands of years to decompose, in the meantime posing threats of marine and human life.

Our study focused on four mangrove-dominated estuaries in KwaZulu-Natal. These were the St Lucia, uMgeni, Durban Harbour and Isipingo estuaries located on the country’s east coast. Healthy mangrove forests are considered important as effective protection of coastlines, and serve as nurseries for many fish species.

We took water and sediment samples over two random days in the dry season, and two random days in the wet season. This is critical as water levels and salinity – salt content – rise and fall depending on the tides and the seasons. In a good wet season, the rivers will flood the estuary with freshwater. Over the dry season, when input from rivers dry up, estuaries may shrink and become more saline. Likewise, stormy ocean weather would inject more saltwater into the estuaries.

As a result, microplastic pollution in the estuaries tend to rise and fall. Rivers, for example, pick up much human waste as they course past and through human settlements, onward to the ocean via estuaries. Microplastic levels have also been found to increase over the dry season, however, due to increased sedimentation.

Across the four estuaries, we found and identified seven types of microplastics. We categorised these as fibres, films, foamed plastics (foam), fragments, fishing line, microbeads, and pellets.

What we found was that microplastic abundance rise with increased levels of what we describe as “disturbance”. This is defined as either the ecological influx of new organisms or species into estuaries, or the human, anthropogenic kind, which includes the introduction of chemicals, heavy metals and other pollution as a result of human residential or industrial activity.

Of the human kind, we identified disturbances such as developments adjacent to the estuaries, microplastic pollution (shopping bags and the like), human effluent and fishing/maritime activities. We showed that, as in other estuaries subject to anthropogenic pressures, the greater those pressures, the greater the levels of macroplastic and microplastic pollution.

We found that microplastic concentrations were highest in water and mangrove sediment of those estuaries affected by industrial, residential and agricultural land uses (Isipingo). This was followed by the system impacted by residential recreational disturbances (uMgeni); and heavy industrial and maritime activities.

St Lucia, which suffers from limited residential and tourism activities, recorded the lowest levels of microplastic levels.

The average sediment concentrations in our study sites varied between 37MPs/kg in semi-rural estuaries and 287 MPs/kg in the most densely populated urban mangroves. In the UK’s River Tame, levels around 240 MPs/kg have been recorded in urban areas. In China, levels went as high as 3,520 MPs/kg in mangroves closer to industrial/urban zones.

The growing threat

South Africa is a developing nation that is cranking up industrial activity. At the same time its population is growing fast, “consuming” more plastic products – from 2010 to 2018, World Wildlife Fund South Africa estimated, total plastic consumption in South Africa grew by 24%. The country has limited consumer and environmental awareness, and multiple shortcomings in its waste management systems.

These issues should be addressed urgently.

"Pesticides Are Spreading Toxic ‘Forever Chemicals,’ Scientists Warn","Scientists have been raising growing concerns for decades over the use of toxic “forever chemicals,” so called because their strong molecular bonds can take hundreds of years to completely break down in the environment. Widely used in consumer products such as cookware and clothing, these substances are turning up everywhere from drinking water to our bloodstream. And now researchers are warning of yet another—and so far underrecognized—source of these troubling toxins: common pesticides. Nearly 70 percent of all pesticides introduced into the global market from 2015 to 2020 contained these chemicals or related compounds, according to a review paper recently published in Environmental Pollution. And the surge in their use has come without a full understanding of their potential impact on the environment and human health.

Forever chemicals—scientifically known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFASs—are a subset of so-called fluorinated chemicals, which possess strong carbon-fluorine bonds. That means such chemicals are both highly stable and useful in products designed to repel grease and water. But it also means they do not readily biodegrade. Though governments have been working to limit the use of PFASs, those efforts are complicated by differing technical definitions of which fluorinated chemicals are technically PFASs—and as such pose a risk to people and the environment. Many chemicals considered PFASs in much of the rest of the world are not classified this way in the U.S. This situation could leave communities exposed to harmful chemicals, including pesticides that contain fluorinated compounds and are sprayed on many different crops around the world every year.

Pesticides made from fluorinated chemicals, commonly referred to as fluorinated pesticides, “can be incredible molecules that meet a lot of the challenges that exist in agriculture,” says study co-author Diogo Alexandrino, a researcher at the University of Porto in Portugal and a co-author of the Environmental Pollution paper. “But they should be properly vetted, and we should be aware that they can have a very huge impact on the environment, on biodiversity and eventually on our own health.”

Stability or Persistence?

Fluorinated chemicals, including PFASs, have been widely used in consumer products since the 1940s. But in the following decades scientists began realizing that these chemicals persisted in drinking water and human bodies, and in the 1990s the Environmental Protection Agency began investigating PFASs. Nearly every U.S. resident now carries low levels of PFASs in their blood. These chemicals have been linked to testicular and kidney cancers, reproductive disorders, thyroid disease, high cholesterol levels, reduced immune response and even increased susceptibility to COVID-19. Based on these concerns, the U.S. Congress is weighing several bipartisan bills to restrict their use in food containers and cookware and to require the EPA to take comprehensive action to prevent PFAS pollution—including setting national limits on levels in drinking water. Under the Biden administration, the EPA has published a PFAS Strategic Roadmap for addressing the crisis. Eight states have already adopted laws to ban PFASs in certain products, especially food packaging—but not in pesticides.

Fluorinated pesticides first appeared on the market in the 1930s, but it is only in the past decade that this use has expanded so dramatically. This rise is linked to improvements in manufacturing processes and the expiration of patents that have allowed for wider competition, Alexandrino says.

Fluorinated pesticides bring “efficacy and stability” to pest management, says Karen Reardon, spokesperson for the pesticide industry group Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment (RISE). That stability makes pesticides remain effective longer, she says—so crops can be sprayed less often than would be needed with a nonfluorinated alternative.

But what Reardon calls stability, others call persistence. Data compiled by Alexandrino and his team show half-lives (the amounts of time it takes chemicals to dissipate by half in the environment) ranging from a few days to 2.5 years for top-selling fluorinated pesticides. That is less than the half-lives of some older pesticides such as DDT, but at the upper end of the scale, it is still a relatively long time: the EPA defines a “persistent” pollutant as having a half-life of 60 days or more. As Kyla Bennett, science director of the nonprofit environmental advocacy organization Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), bluntly puts it, “Why on earth would you allow PFAS to be put in something that’s sprayed on millions and millions of acres every single year? It’s called a forever chemical for a reason.”

What Is—and Isn’t—a PFAS?

One of the most widely used fluorinated pesticides is bifenthrin. It targets insects’ nervous system and is the prime ingredient in more than 600 pesticide formulations used on corn, soy, vegetables, berries and orchard crops. It is also used to treat seeds and to control ants, termites and other pests in urban settings. Its potential effects on human health are not well known, though there is some evidence that chronic exposure is linked to neurotoxicity, and the EPA has classified it as a possible human carcinogen. Ultimately, the EPA concluded in a 2020 human health risk assessment that “dietary exposure and risk estimates are not of concern for the existing uses of bifenthrin”—at least when levels designated as safe for human consumption are not exceeded. But amounts found in recent years on collard greens, eggplants, spinach, cherry tomatoes, sweet potatoes and peaches have exceeded those EPA safety levels. Removing such residues from produce requires extra scrubbing because bifenthrin is an oily substance.

Bifenthrin is also a persistent pollutant with a half-life of 97 to 345 days in soil, depending on soil type. A 2016 U.S. Geological Survey study found that it binds to sediments contained in stormwater and can persist in surface waters, where it harms beneficial insects that provide food for fish, birds and wildlife. Its particular configuration of carbon and fluorine is “really stable and will be really persistent in the environment,” says University of Porto researcher Maria de Fátima Carvalho, a co-author of the new paper.

Although bifenthrin is one of more than 200 active pesticide ingredients that would be recognized as a PFAS by the latest Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition and is banned for most agricultural uses in the European Union, the EPA has a narrower definition of a PFAS. Differing definitions complicate efforts to understand and regulate such chemicals’ use. The EPA definition only includes compounds with relatively longer carbon-fluorine molecule chains because it says those are generally less likely to accumulate in the food chain and are potentially less toxic—though not all experts agree on this. “It is incorrect to argue that everything is safe until you have two, three or four [carbon-fluorine] bonds,” says Rolf Halden, director of the Biodesign Center for Environmental Health Engineering at Arizona State University. “We’ve created a chemistry with no known biodegradation mechanism. You’re signing up for a lifetime of exposure around the world and for millennia.”

In an e-mail to Scientific American, EPA spokesperson Robert Daguillard wrote that the agency’s PFAS definition, first developed in 2006, was intended to “identify the PFAS most likely to present risk to human health and the environment.” The definition has since been adjusted, Daguillard added, and “we are currently looking at the differences between the OECD and [EPA] definitions to determine whether the [EPA] definition should be modified to capture additional substances.”

At least three active pesticide ingredients currently allowed by the EPA—broflanilide, pyrifluquinazon and noviflumuron—meet its definition for a PFAS. Four others that the EPA qualifies as a PFAS have been banned in the U.S. but are still used in Japan, China and some countries in Latin America. New pesticide ingredients that the EPA would classify as PFASs continue to come on the market in China. While the three allowed in the U.S. have half-lives of a few months at the most, that measure does not tell the whole story, says Nathan Donley, environmental health science director at the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit conservation group. “On paper, they look like they break down within a reasonable time period”—but the by-products of that breakdown also need to be considered, Donley says. “You’ve got the parent pesticide molecule that can break down into something that’s ... still a complex molecule, fairly fluorinated,” he adds. “And what those degradation products are doing in the environment is really not followed up with at all.” Wendy Heiger-Bernays, a clinical professor of environmental health at the Boston University School of Public Health, says the breakdown products of fluorinated pesticides may interact with other environmental PFAS pollution in unknown ways.

EPA spokesperson Cathy Milbourn says the agency “has a robust process for identifying and assessing the environmental risks of pesticide degradation products or metabolites.” But Donley argues that while the EPA looks at initial breakdown products, it does not follow the pesticide degradation process to its completion—which he says can take decades or centuries and can produce dozens of different molecules along the way. Moreover, what happens in the environment does not always track what happens in the laboratory. “I don’t necessarily expect the EPA to do all the study necessary to get definitive answers for all of these things, but they need to account for this uncertainty somehow,” Donley says. “The benefit of the doubt should be given to people and the environment, not to the pesticide companies.”

When Scientific American asked what actions the EPA may take to restrict pesticides that do meet its definition of a PFAS, Milbourn responded in an e-mail that “regardless of the evolving definition of PFAS, pesticides undergo a rigorous scientific assessment process prior to registration” and that “fluorinated pesticides in commerce have met appropriate risk-based standards for registration.”

But PEER’s Bennett, who previously worked at the EPA’s New England regional office for more than a decade, is among many who point out that the data the agency use to evaluate pesticide safety are almost entirely provided by manufacturers—which Bennet says leaves regulators open to “incredible industry capture” and “political pressure” to get pesticides on the market. She claims that EPA staff evaluating pesticide risks do not have access to enough information to do their job correctly. Recent reporting by the Intercept and Investigate Midwest has also brought these issues to light. Responding to Bennett’s points, RISE’s Reardon says that the “EPA’s pesticide determinations are made solely by the agency as it fulfills its remit under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.” The EPA declined to comment when asked about Bennett’s claims.

“The EPA and everyone is telling us these [fluorinated pesticides] are so much better than the older [nonfluorinated] ones. And in some regards, that might be true,” Donley says. “But it’s really worrisome to me that even though these don’t technically meet the EPA definition of PFAS, they meet the PFAS definition of much of the rest of the world.”

Others, however, prefer to focus on the pesticides that the EPA has already labeled as PFASs. “We’ve seen fluoro groups in insecticides, but I would not call those PFAS,” says Graham Peaslee, a professor of physics at the University of Notre Dame. Heiger-Bernays also says she is “less concerned” about the potential for human harm from some pesticides such as bifenthrin. Emphasizing that she is not a “pesticide advocate,” she says there can be legitimate uses for these chemicals: “There are,” Heiger-Bernays notes, “times when we would like our houses not to be consumed by termites.” The issue, she says, is to figure out what those limited, legitimate uses are—and then curtail everything else.

Whether the EPA’s PFAS Strategic Roadmap will lead to action on fluorinated pesticides—particularly those that meet its PFAS definition—remains to be seen. In an e-mail to Scientific American, Milbourn wrote that “as EPA continues to refine the testing process, as regulatory work matures, and as the Agency learns more from its partnerships across the country, the Agency will adjust the definition of PFAS to reflect the information gathered through this process. As the agency determines the scope of this issue, it will continue to use all available regulatory and non-regulatory tools to address PFAS.”

For some, those words are not reassuring. “I think a lot of us are holding our breath. We really don’t know a lot right now,” Donley says. “I’m hoping for the best, but I think it’ll take a few years, or even a few decades, to really grasp what is going to happen with all these new fluorinated pesticides.”",,[],"['Meg Wilcox', 'About The Author S', 'Meg Wilcox Is A Boston-Based Environmental Journalist.', 'Recent Articles Meg Wilcox']"
Air Monitors Alone Won’t Save Communities From Toxic Industrial Air Pollution,"The Calvert City Elementary School playground across the street from the Little Bo Peep Child Development Center. For years, an air monitor on the grounds of the Kentucky school has captured elevated levels of toxic industrial air pollution.

One summer night last year, air began flowing into a steel canister across the street from the Little Bo Peep Child Development Center in Calvert City, Kentucky. The pollution monitor hummed into the morning as parents dropped off their toddlers and later into the day as the kids played outside. Within a month, a lab analysis would reveal that the canister had captured a troubling concentration of ethylene dichloride, which has been linked to pancreatic and stomach cancers and leukemia.

No one, however, raced in to warn parents or alert nearby residents that the air they sucked in with every breath was laced with a poisonous chemical. No one took immediate steps to stop the stream or sue the offending polluter into compliance.

In fact, that Calvert City monitor had been running all year, along with two others around town. Each of them had registered more ethylene dichloride than any of the 123 other monitors nationwide designed to detect the chemical. The results had been logged by Kentucky regulators and uploaded to a database managed by the Environmental Protection Agency.

If my child attended that day care, “I would be very concerned and working tremendously to get them into another school,” said Wilma Subra, an environmental health expert who advises the EPA on community concerns, after reviewing a summary of the air-monitoring results at ProPublica’s request.

It’s examples like Calvert City, experts say, that expose an infuriating conundrum with the U.S. systems for protecting citizens from dangerous pollution: Regulators install air monitors to flag hazardous emissions from local companies, then pull their punches in taking action against the offenders.

Meanwhile, the monitors serve as a false promise to residents that the findings will be used to keep them safe. Some people believe the mere existence of monitoring is “protecting them” from harm, said Barbara Morin, an air pollution expert at a nonprofit that advises the environmental regulators of eight Northeastern states. “Unfortunately, sometimes there’s just the monitoring and nothing happens to change the situation.”

ProPublica spent the last year crisscrossing the country to detail the failures of the EPA and state regulators to measure and address the community impacts of industrial toxic air pollution. The series of stories resulted in immediate response, including promises by the EPA to install monitors and track outputs — a move hailed as a victory for local communities. Residents of many of the toxic hot spots had spent years begging regulators to install them.

But an examination of the long history of air monitors in Calvert City shows that even when the monitors capture years’ worth of evidence that a polluter is putting a community in harm’s way, the path to clean, safe air is rocky and filled with well-funded obstacles, misdirection and inaction.

An air monitor maintained by Kentucky environmental regulators has been located behind Calvert City Elementary School for about a decade.

In this remote industrial city of 2,500, where manufacturing has long been king, regulators have had proof for at least three decades that residents are breathing dangerous amounts of air pollution. During that time, the EPA and the state have amassed an extraordinary amount of documentation establishing not just how hazardous the air is in Calvert City, but where the worst pollution is coming from.

They’ve watched in real time as the problem got worse and as the estimated cancer risks of area residents crossed the threshold level that the EPA considered acceptable — in places, reaching 17 times that limit.

Nicole Deziel, a Yale epidemiology professor and environmental health expert, said it could take decades to see the damage. Researchers often find themselves lagging behind, studying emerging cancer clusters and trying to reconstruct the cause, Deziel said. In Calvert City, where there’s already data that pollution levels exceed what’s considered safe, “we have the opportunity to actually intervene,” she said.

State and federal regulators have an arsenal of ways to do so and hold the culprits accountable, including levying millions in fines, requiring pollution controls and launching criminal investigations.

And yet, as the history of Calvert City shows, such action isn’t a given. In the face of a global petrochemical corporation, in a company town where residents are reluctant to criticize their employers, regulators have, again and again, stopped short of using all the tools at their disposal.

“Good Neighbor”

Founded on a railroad stop near the Tennessee River, Calvert City began attracting industrial development after the Kentucky Dam brought cheap electricity to the region in the 1940s. By 2020, more than a quarter of the private-sector jobs in surrounding Marshall County came from chemical plants and other manufacturing, with wages well above those in other fields. Every year, local families gather for a “Good Neighbor Night” hosted by a collection of plants whose employees hand out free swag, such as lawn chairs printed with the companies’ logos, as a turtle mascot named Wally Wise Guy teaches kids how to shelter in place in the event of an industrial accident.

Westlake Chemical moved into town in 1990, expanding over time into three plants — a maze of industrial boilers, tanks and wastewater ponds, with innumerable smokestacks and vents and pipes. The plants make polyvinyl chloride, better known as PVC, and petrochemicals used in construction, packaging and other goods. The company got regulatory permits that authorized it to release thousands of pounds of carcinogens a year, but almost from the start, additional, unauthorized releases accidentally seeped or leaked into the air, according to EPA records. It wasn’t just ethylene dichloride, but vinyl chloride, which is highly flammable and has been associated with brain, liver and lung cancers. (The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment).

While a few plants run by other companies nearby also emitted these chemicals, Westlake’s authorized emissions would come to dwarf theirs. According to the most recent four years of available federal data, Westlake released at least 48,000 pounds of ethylene dichloride per year; the other companies combined released just 1 pound. Westlake’s annual vinyl chloride emissions during that time were at least 28 times that of the others.

Within eight years of Westlake’s opening, state and federal regulators had already been alerted to problems at the sprawling compound. In the decades that followed, news articles and regulatory documents would chart the company’s checkered record with the chemicals. In 1998, for example, Westlake told the EPA that it hadn’t released any ethylene dichloride into the water when it had actually released more than 8,000 pounds, according to an EPA complaint. In 2001, it waited more than an hour before reporting a 2,727-pound leak; the same happened four years later, after a release of 7,700 pounds, the complaint said. The company was supposed to immediately inform a federal center for chemical accidents if it leaked 100 pounds of the potent carcinogen into the air.

Shortly after that leak in 2005, the local emergency response system made thousands of automated calls warning residents to shelter indoors, The Paducah Sun reported. The system had been adopted after 5,000 pounds of leaking vinyl chloride caused a fire and explosion at the plant in 2002. Despite the calls in 2005, a Westlake manager told The Associated Press that air monitors hadn’t detected the carcinogen outside the plant’s boundaries.

In 2010, the EPA took the aggressive step of announcing a consent decree, a settlement that involves complex negotiations with the help of the Department of Justice. Under the terms of the decree, Westlake agreed to pay $800,000 and create a vast leak detection plan. Failure to meet those terms could lead to daily penalties of up to $5,000. The EPA predicted this would force Westlake to cut emissions of vinyl chloride by 2,300 pounds a year and of ethylene dichloride by 1,300 pounds per year.

Less than a year later, more than 11,000 pounds of vinyl chloride and 2,000 pounds of ethylene dichloride streamed out of a hole in a piece of Westlake piping, according to state and federal records. The leak destroyed the EPA’s goal in a single day; the agency later found Westlake hadn’t inspected the piping for mechanical integrity.

“Negligence Loophole”

With that leak in 2011, state regulators believed they had three separate air pollution violations, but Westlake wielded its legal might to fight back.

In the company’s lengthy response to regulators, a Westlake manager interrogated the definitions of basic terms like “equipment leak” or “standard” and argued that none of the violations were valid. In response, Kentucky regulators rescinded one of them, noting that the federal rule only applied to leaks during startups, shutdowns or malfunctions. Then they offered a startling rationale: The leak didn’t count as a “malfunction” because the problem partly stemmed from “poor operations and maintenance.”

“We are left with this loophole,” the regulators wrote.

Experts say such exit ramps from regulation are not uncommon. The system often presents a “laundry list of defenses” to polluters, said Seema Kakade, a former attorney in the EPA’s civil enforcement division who is now a law professor at the University of Maryland. Some provide leeway for unavoidable accidents and some are negotiated end-runs around the rules by corporate or other special interests, she said — with large, wealthy companies poised to take advantage.

Westlake benefited from what was “basically a negligence loophole” that “allows plants to avoid accountability even for releases caused by their own poor operations and maintenance,” Jim Pew, an attorney for the nonprofit group Earthjustice, said in an email. His organization has spent decades advocating for stronger EPA rules.

Over the next few years, the EPA unearthed four more leaks caused by faulty inspections or testing. However, none of these incidents broke the terms of the consent decree, as the agency concluded that these leaks concerned “alleged violations” of a different regulation from the one cited in the consent decree, said Tim Carroll, deputy press secretary for the EPA. (Carroll said Westlake has continuously demonstrated compliance with the 2010 settlement.) Despite the continued problems, and additional leaks cited by state regulators, Westlake was able to expand one of its plants — a move with so little pushback from the state that then-Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat, attended the ceremony. (Beshear didn’t respond to a request for comment.)

In 2017, two state environmental investigators were on the highway when they spotted a plume of black smoke, which they traced to a flare at a Westlake plant. Flares reduce pollution by burning off toxic gases, and they’re much less effective when there’s visible smoke. When the inspectors parked outside the facility fence to take photos, a Westlake security officer came out “and, after we had introduced ourselves, asked us to leave this location,” an inspector wrote in a report, which they did. Hours later, the plume of smoke was still visible from 10 miles away.

Though this violation and others at the same plant could have entailed millions in penalties, the agency offered Westlake a $350,000 settlement, according to an email from Beth Clemons, a Kentucky environmental enforcement specialist, to Westlake. In the email, obtained through open records requests, Clemons called it “a good deal.”

Westlake flatly disagreed. “$350,000 may be a good deal if there were violations, which we clearly believe there are not,” Kevin Sheridan, a Westlake health, safety and environment manager, wrote in an email.

Clemons responded that state regulators believed “the violations are valid and we are pretty much in total disagreement with what you are saying.”

The parties eventually agreed on a $175,000 penalty and a list of required repairs — a sanction that experts say amounts to a financial hiccup for the corporation that owns Westlake. Last year, Westlake’s parent company, Westlake Corporation, reported $2 billion in net income from dozens of facilities across North America, Europe and Asia.

Such penalties are “like a nuisance to the facility. It doesn’t serve as a significant deterrent,” said Scott Throwe, a former senior staffer in the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. Wealthy corporations see it as “the cost of doing business.”

In response to questions about the effectiveness of its enforcement actions, John Mura, director of communication for the Kentucky regulator, said in a statement that his agency “remains committed to safeguarding the health of all Kentuckians and believes that it has acted appropriately under its regulatory authority.”

Even the better-resourced EPA rarely seeks maximum fines, said George Czerniak, a former enforcement officer in EPA’s Midwest regional office. Doing so involves going to court, and there is no guarantee the judge will rule favorably. The risk, he said, has made the agency skittish about pursuing aggressive sanctions in court. In the 35 years he spent on air pollution enforcement covering six states, Czerniak recalled fewer than 20 cases that ended up before a judge or jury.

If the EPA is going to take a case to court, then it needs to be “assured this is an important case,” Czerniak said — and one that “we can win.”

Limited budgets and EPA leaders’ changing priorities drove a decline in EPA enforcement actions from 2007 to 2018, according to a recent EPA Inspector General report. In 2009, the office that manages Kentucky conducted 2,700 inspections and other related activities to ensure polluters were following the law; that number plummeted more than 50% over the next decade. After Donald Trump became president, his administration deferred more enforcement cases to the states; Throwe said state agencies are more hamstrung by political pressure and less able to act decisively. “That’s why EPA is supposed to be the neutral entity that goes in,” he said.

The EPA wrapped up another investigation of Westlake in 2019, issuing a consent agreement and final order for a series of leaks that occurred more recently. The order, which is less serious than a consent decree, came with a $49,000 penalty. The company also had to buy $183,500 worth of equipment for local emergency responders. Four additional EPA inquiries of Westlake violations over the past decade have resulted in less than $150,000 in penalties.

Throwe said it would have been more effective to require Westlake to install no-leak valves and other devices to reduce leaks.

“This shows how hard it is to actually effect change,” he said.

“You Can’t Use That”

Manufacturers in Calvert City benefited from yet another flaw in oversight: Even when regulators stocked the town with air monitors that logged damning evidence, bureaucratic bungles and missed opportunities rendered them virtually useless.

Alarm bells about dangerously dirty air began going off as far back as 2005. Some of the more than 10,000 air samples collected statewide by Kentucky regulators over the prior 15 years showed “levels of concern” in Calvert City, and officials announced a work group to investigate “elevated levels of hazardous air pollutants,” the Courier-Journal in Louisville, Kentucky, reported.

Between 2005 and 2007, state regulators installed five monitors in town, including the one at Calvert City Elementary School, across the street from the Little Bo Peep day care center.

Air monitors installed between 2005 and 2007.

Once every six days, the monitors took a 24-hour sample that was analyzed for ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride and other hazardous pollutants. “What they’ve done here is way more air monitoring than what’s required by any EPA program,” said Morin, the Northeastern air pollution expert. “So the state clearly recognized there was some issue they wanted to deal with.”

By 2015, a quarter of the samples from the monitor closest to Westlake’s vinyls plant had levels of ethylene dichloride that violated EPA’s long-term cancer risk guidelines.

But an EPA audit that year found a critical flaw in the data; the state had never created a quality-assurance plan for the monitors, detailing the procedures to ensure that the collected data was reliable and accurate. Neglecting to do so, Throwe said, “gives ammunition to the industry to say, ‘You can’t use that.’”

Kentucky officials say they didn’t break any rules in their failure to implement a quality-assurance plan. But a spokesperson for the EPA regional office in charge of Kentucky said the federal government required such a plan.

The agency ordered the state to develop one in 2015, but two years later Kentucky still didn’t have one. By then, every one of the five monitors had captured elevated cancer risks, with ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride the chief culprits. The EPA considers a 1 in 10,000 risk as acceptable, meaning that if 10,000 people in an area are exposed to a certain level of hazardous air pollution over a lifetime, at least one person would develop cancer as a result. (These EPA guidelines are used to calculate community cancer risk, and it’s nearly impossible to tie an individual cancer case to emissions from a specific facility.) In Calvert City, at least one sample showed cumulative risk as high as 60 times the limit, according to a 2017 risk screening analysis conducted by the EPA.

“Overall, the weight of evidence indicates that high levels of several VOC air toxics are present in the air in the Calvert City area,” concluded a report from Kentucky regulators and the EPA, while acknowledging that the lack of a quality-assurance plan “may affect the potential legal defensibility of the prior data collected.”

Mura said the state didn’t develop a plan because “no specific data monitoring objective was identified by EPA or Kentucky for the data collected.” Mura said his agency doesn’t know how many residents were exposed to those concentrations or for how long.

The failure to come up with a plan — rendering the results vulnerable to challenge — was baffling to experts and advocates. Monitoring for hazardous air pollutants is a costly, painstaking endeavor; no regulator would operate multiple monitors for years without a good reason, several experts told ProPublica. “You would think you’d want to get data that you can use,” Czerniak said.

And despite its worrisome conclusions, neither the EPA nor state regulators told residents about the cancer analysis. Billy Pitts, public health director of the Marshall County Health Department, said no one has contacted his office.

“We’ll Cross Those Bridges When We Get There”

It wasn’t until 2020 — five years after it was ordered to do so and 15 years after concerns about toxic air pollution were first raised — that Kentucky finally put in place a quality-assurance plan that would make the monitors’ data usable in serious enforcement efforts. It was the seventh straight year that one of Westlake’s plants emitted more ethylene dichloride than any other polluter in the country.

In 2020, the EPA installed new monitors in town after conducting air modeling to find the areas with the highest concentrations of the dangerous chemicals. The agency modeled vinyl chloride and ethylene dichloride emissions from the three Westlake facilities and three other nearby plants. Federal data shows that Westlake releases far more of these compounds than the other companies: Since 2010, only one of the non-Westlake plants has leaked vinyl chloride (a 15-pound leak in 2014), and none has leaked ethylene dichloride, according to state records. In contrast, regulators have cited Westlake at least a dozen times for leaking these and other hazardous compounds.

EPA and state regulators are analyzing data from the new monitors (and the one at the school) that was gathered from October 2020 to September 2021. A cancer risk analysis will be shared with the community once it’s complete.

Air monitors for the October 2020-September 2021 study. The EPA modeled emissions from the six facilities shown in order to determine the monitors’ locations. Two of the monitors were placed to catch the highest concentrations of ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride; the monitor at the school indicates what people are exposed to near the center of town.

If the results show a cause for concern, then “we’ll cross those bridges when we get there,” said Pitts, the health director, during an interview in his office. After ProPublica described the elevated levels from the past decade, Pitts said he wouldn’t “get too concerned until I see the facts that are presented.”

He later explained his department conducts a community health assessment once every three years, using data from local hospitals, schools and other sources. After ProPublica showed him air-monitoring reports from the EPA and state regulators, Pitts shared the materials with the team developing the health assessment, he said. The next assessment is scheduled for June, and the community would help decide the top public health concerns.

Interim updates from the current study, obtained through public records requests, show higher concentrations than the earlier data. While average ethylene dichloride levels at one monitor near the Westlake plants exceeded the EPA’s cancer risk guideline by 40% in 2017, the newer data showed the levels exceeded the limit by 600%. When ProPublica showed the data to Morin, the concentrations were so high in Calvert City that she initially thought there’d been a mistake.

Czerniak, the former EPA regional enforcement officer, said that if he were in charge, he would assign three of the federal agency’s technical experts and a couple of attorneys to do a deep dive on the Westlake plants and neighboring polluters. Czerniak has conducted similar investigations during his time at EPA, he said. If the agency found that specific air-permit violations at any Calvert City facility are pushing air pollution past acceptable cancer risk, he said, it should require the facilities to fix the root cause. If the excessive risk is caused by the sheer quantity of local facilities, the case could be referred to EPA headquarters with the request that tighter emission limits be put on these types of facilities.

In an email, Carroll, the EPA spokesperson, said the agency “is continuing to take steps to address noncompliance” at Westlake’s plants. In response to questions about the company’s pattern of violations, Carroll cited the ongoing study in Calvert City and said the EPA “will address any noncompliance identified using the appropriate enforcement tools.”

ProPublica Read More Poison in the Air

The EPA is also investigating Westlake’s flares at its Calvert City and Lake Charles, Louisiana, facilities, according to the company’s 2021 annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The EPA has worked on the case since 2014 and “indicated that it is seeking a consent decree that would obligate us to take corrective actions,” the report said. The decree could lead to penalties “in excess of $1 million,” the report continued. “We do not believe that the resolution of these flare matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.” (An EPA spokesperson said the agency “cannot comment on potential or ongoing investigations.”)

It might be time to raise the stakes by building a criminal case against Westlake, Czerniak said, as even the threat of a criminal investigation could change the facility’s behavior. “I realize that agencies have limited capacity to undertake criminal-type proceedings, but heck, when you have a community that is exposed” to cancer risks up to 60 times the EPA’s acceptable limit, he said, “make no mistake ... there are people who are being impacted.”

The motivation to hold the polluter accountable may need to come from regulators, as most residents ProPublica encountered in Calvert City were unaware of Westlake’s environmental record or the pattern of alarming air-monitoring data. When a reporter and photographer visited community leaders in March, we found that no one had heard of ethylene dichloride, and most did not know there was an air monitor at the school. Some expressed concern after learning about elevated levels of carcinogens.

“We know the EPA monitors the area,” said Tammy Blackwell, director of the county library system. “I would hope that if anything was significant enough that we needed to be made aware of it, the EPA would let us know.”

Tammy Blackwell, Director of the Marshall County Public Library.

Marshall County Schools Superintendent Steve Miracle was even blunter: “You can’t just record it. ... You would think if they’re the EPA, they can actually go in and help those companies come up with a solution for correcting that.”

Others did not want to talk about the companies that support the tax base and employ their friends and family.

Mayor Gene Colburn didn’t respond to multiple inquiries for this story, including messages left in person. (The mayor and three of the six City Council members work for local chemical plants, but not for Westlake.) The principal of Calvert City Elementary School, Kendra Glenn, declined through a representative to listen to a single question when ProPublica reporters visited in March.

Connie Monroe, who owns the Little Bo Peep day care across the street, said that she’d want to learn more about the pollution if it’s harming the kids she cares for, but that her husband recently retired from a local chemical plant. “It’s made our living,” she said, “so I’m not going to say anything critical.”

Chemical plants “do a lot for the community,” retired nurse Sherry Todd said on a recent spring day while watching her grandson’s soccer practice. The plants pay taxes that go toward “making Calvert City nice.” She had no qualms about air pollution or the plants hurting the town. “I can’t believe they’d do something intentionally,” she said.

About the Story

Last year, ProPublica conducted an analysis of data from the EPA’s Risk Screening Environmental Indicators model to identify hot spots of cancer-causing industrial air pollution across the United States. We then compared the results of our analysis to data from the EPA’s Air Quality System (AQS), which is a database of state, local and federally collected ambient air-monitoring samples. Because the EPA does not require states to set up air monitors near most major sources of toxic air pollution, we were unable to make comparisons in many of the hot spots that we identified. We filtered and sorted the data to understand which air monitors in the AQS network were picking up high concentrations of cancer-causing chemicals. Calvert City stood out, particularly for its concentrations of ethylene dichloride, a potent human carcinogen. Our analysis of the RSEI model indicated that Westlake was the dominant driver of cancer risk in Calvert City, so we began investigating the enforcement history of the facility and the reason the monitoring program was established there in the first place. We obtained documents through public records requests and correspondence with the EPA and Kentucky Division for Air Quality.

Racism drives environmental inequality — but most Americans don’t realize,"Survey finds that most people think poverty is why pollution disproportionately affects Black people, despite evidence that racism is the major cause.

Most Americans do not think that Black people are any more likely to be affected by pollution than white people, despite significant evidence that racism is a root cause of environmental injustice in the United States, a survey has found.

Numerous research papers over the years have shown that people of colour and poor people are significantly more likely to live in areas of high pollution — a result of the deliberate construction of polluting industries in these communities, says Dylan Bugden, an environmental sociologist at Washington State University in Pullman.

But Bugden found that respondents to the survey were more than twice as likely to identify poverty as the main cause of environmental inequalities, instead of blaming structural racism. This is despite scientific evidence clearly demonstrating that “race, rather than poverty, is the primary factor behind environmental inequality”, notes Bugden in his study, published in Social Problems1. Additionally, many people suggested that a lack of hard work and poor personal choices were responsible for increased exposure to pollution.

“The evidence here is strong: America is in a state of denial about its racism and the unequal impacts of environmental exposures,” says Timmons Roberts, an environmental sociologist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.

The US mindset

To investigate how Americans view environmental injustice, Budgen devised two sets of questions. The National Opinion Research Center, which operates out of the University of Chicago in Illinois, distributed these through mail, telephone and face-to-face interviews to households that were randomly selected and nationally representative. They received responses from 1,000 people.

The first set of questions explored whether Americans understand the causes of environmental inequality, whether they think it is fair and whether they support policies that address it. The results showed that only one-third of people felt that Black people are more likely to experience pollution and that this inequality is unfair. By contrast, another third of the respondents acknowledged that Black and Hispanic people and poor people experience environmental inequalities but felt that it is fair. Most respondents, however, generally supported policy measures to address these issues, such as compensating people affected by pollution.

The second set of questions investigated how beliefs about hard work and social mobility along with racial attitudes influence US opinions about environmental inequality. Respondents whom the survey characterized as having an underlying bias against Black people were less likely to understand the causes of environmental inequality. They were also more likely to think that pollution is more harmful to poor communities than Black communities. Additionally, when respondents felt that people could get out of harmful living situations by, say, working harder, they were also less likely to think that Black communities disproportionately experience environmental pollution.

Unequal opportunities

Bugden says the results show that there is a widespread belief in the United States that everyone has equal opportunities and that existing inequalities aren’t due to race. Instead, some Americans think that the only barriers facing minority racial groups are personal choice, responsibility and hard work, he says. He calls this phenomenon colour-blind environmental racism.

The lack of understanding that racism is causing environmental inequality undermines efforts to fix those disparities, even when the data show that race is the biggest predictor of exposure to environmental hazards, says Sacoby Wilson, an environmental-health scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park.

To gain more public support for policies that address the role of racism in environmental inequality, environmental-justice research needs to be better integrated into school curriculums and the media so people become more aware of the issues, says Sarah Grineski, a sociologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

The findings also have lessons for the groups and organizations trying to address environmental injustices and protect marginalized communities. These groups should consider communicating that race is the root of environmental inequalities, Bugden says. “It has got to be part of our environmental policy,” he concludes.

US President Joe Biden has promised to address environmental inequalities. His administration’s Justice40 initiative pledges that disadvantaged communities will receive 40% of the federal government’s investments in climate and clean energy. But advocacy groups have criticized the initiative because the tool it will use to decide which communities are disadvantaged does not currently factor in race. “People have this myth in their brains that poverty is the biggest driver of the differential burden of hazards when it isn’t,” says Wilson. “It’s race and racism.”",,[],"['Miller', 'Brittney J.', 'Brittney J.

"As Wisconsin works on what to do about PFAS pollution, neighboring states are also trying to address the problem","As Wisconsin works on what to do about PFAS pollution, neighboring states are also trying to address the problem.

Illinois has enacted a new law to prohibit the incineration of some PFAS-based substances.

The man-made chemical compounds are most commonly associated with groundwater pollution.

But Sonya Lunder - senior toxics policy advisor with the Sierra Club - said the per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances may even be able to withstand high-power incinerators, which have been used to dispose of PFAS-based materials.

She explained that the extreme heat can even cause chemical reactions in the compounds.

""If they're partially reacted, they form a variety of harmful breakdown products,"" said Lunder, ""and/or the PFAS would literally just be going up the stack and falling out in the nearby community.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that scientists are still learning about the exact health effects PFAS could have. But high levels of PFAS contamination may lead to - among other issues - lower birth weights, increased risk of cancer and decreased vaccine response in children.

The National Institutes of Health reports there are about 5,000 distinct members of the PFAS family. Lunder explained the bill was narrowed to cover about 170 older PFAS compounds that are still found in some stored-but-unusable firefighting foams.

She said as new PFAS are developed and implemented, more expansive policies may be necessary.

""We are concerned,"" said Lunder, ""because the chemical industry is so rapidly innovating and shifting to new and closely related chemicals that the narrowing that happened to the bill will mean that over time there will be other types of waste that could be burned.""

While Illinois' ban may be relatively narrow in scope, Nicole Saulsberry - Illinois state government representative with the Sierra Club - contends it's one of the most robust PFAS-incineration policies in the country.

She explained the measure was based on similar policies in New York, but that those only cover specific communities.

""But with Illinois, it's a statewide ban,"" said Saulsberry. ""So this bill that was passed in Illinois is historic in the sense that we're the only state to have a statewide ban on the incineration of PFAS.""

PFAS are also known as ""forever chemicals,"" as they'll essentially never break down under normal environmental conditions.

But Lunder explained that the Environmental Protection Agency is investigating a potential solution - using heat and pressure to destroy the compounds through a process known as supercritical water oxidation.",,[],"['Wxpr', 'Born', 'Raised In Indiana', 'Jonah Chester Has Been Covering Issues In Wisconsin For The Past Several Years.

Air pollution kills millions - it's time to tackle it seriously,"Air pollution causes a slew of negative health impacts for those affected by it, and claims the lives of 7 million people every year.

It also accelerates and is worsened by climate change, with the effects most acute for the 70% of the global population who live in cities.

Tackling air pollution is an imperative that can be accomplished by ensuring cross-sectoral accountability for planetary and human health.

The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of more than six million people — that figure is shocking and a tragedy.

But perhaps more shocking, though, is that people worldwide have been victims of another silent killer for years — one that now kills more people every year than COVID has in two: air pollution.

Estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) reveal that 7 million people lose their lives every year as a result of air pollution. WHO estimates that 9 in 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.

Breathing fine particulate matter — known as PM2·5 — can exacerbate not only chronic lung diseases, but also harm lung development, lead to higher rates of breast cancer, cause earlier onset of neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s and increase heart attacks and stroke.

An estimated 90% of children worldwide grow up breathing polluted air, direct harm that is completely out of their control and which could have implications for the rest of their lives.

Air pollution is a global health crisis that has largely flown under the radar for years, but one that will increasingly take centre-stage as the fight against climate change ramps up.

Air pollution and climate change

Many air pollutants are also greenhouse gases, and, as such, they accelerate climate change. This means the impacts of air pollution occur both directly — when it causes health issues — and indirectly, by accelerating climate change.

As temperatures rise, an increased occurrence of extreme weather events and rising sea levels will pose further threats to human health. This makes tackling air pollution an important priority for planetary health, a concept that describes the interactions between human health and the environments we depend on.

These risks are concentrated in cities where a growing number — now more than 70% — of people worldwide live. Accelerating efforts to tackle air pollution in cities has the potential to slow and reverse the trajectory of a rising burden of disease caused by the phenomenon.

This is demonstrated in a recent study that found declines in PM2·5 levels in the early phase of the pandemic were associated with significantly fewer heart attacks across the United States. But this potential remains largely untapped.

Accountability for health is largely siloed within the health sector and away from construction, transport, housing and urban development — all of which can play a critical role in determining the quality of the air we breathe.

What is required is a cross-cutting approach that aligns the core business of organisations with the critical goal of improving air quality.

What can be done?

The 2022 theme of World Health Day was Our Planet, Our Health. This concept challenges us to imagine a world where clean air is available to all, and where people have control of their health and that of the planet.

With global economic systems in post-pandemic recovery mode, we are presented with a historic opportunity to build healthy, livable and sustainable cities. This will require meaningful and actionable commitments from those designing and financing the urban projects that shape the future of cities.

Healthy and sustainable cities will require institutionalised mechanisms for inclusive and participatory urban health governance that includes young people. These activities must be supported by robust and reliable real-time data on how urban environments are changing, and how the changes influence health.

Air pollution is an entry point to planetary health. To catalyze action for clean air — to improve health and tackle climate change — we must reform how we think about accountability for air pollution and health.

Implementers, funders, educators and civil society as a whole can play a role in this movement to health-proof and climate-proof our futures.

Cross-sectoral accountability

For implementers, we propose participatory measurement and governance of urban decision-making, centred on planetary health. Given the interdependencies between air pollution, climate change and health, policy actors have an opportunity to implement innovative reforms of the overarching systems that govern health.

One example of such an approach is an integrated community-oriented primary health and climate care system, which links climate resilience with primary prevention of disease. The backbone of such a system is the integrated surveillance of disease, socio-economic determinants of health, and environmental risks such as air pollution.

Such a system could identify sources of spikes in air pollution, for example, or identify increases in hospital admissions due to childhood asthma.

Additionally, implementers — also including those in the private sector responsible for designing and building urban development and infrastructure projects — can commit to centring planetary health in all urban infrastructure development initiatives.

Environment What's the World Economic Forum doing to tackle air pollution? Over 50% of countries have established national ambient air quality standards, but we must do more to protect citizens and our planet.

During COP26 the World Economic Forum and the Clean Air Fund launched the first global private sector initiative to tackle air pollution.

Image: Jane Burston/ World Economic Forum Founding members of the Alliance for Clean Air are committed to measuring and decreasing their air pollution emissions, creating healthier communities around the world. Members of the Alliance for Clean Air will: Establish air pollution footprints on nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, particulate matter within 12 months

Pinpoint where they are being emitted to track human exposure

Set ambitious targets and objectives to reduce the air pollution emissions, with a clear action plan

Act as champions for clean air by raising awareness among employees, customers and communities about the impact of air pollution. They will also help them to reduce their exposure and support them to take action to reduce pollution

Use their assets innovatively to accelerate clean air solutions Also at COP26, a practical guide for businesses on how to measure air pollution across value chains is being introduced by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and Stockholm Environment Institute, in co-operation with IKEA. The guide will support companies to understand their impact on air quality and to take necessary actions to reduce their emissions. If your company is committed to improving air quality contact us to express interest in working with us.

Investors and funders can prioritise support for projects that promote cross-sectoral collaboration to broaden access to healthy urban environments. This could be through initiatives that support the establishment of cross sectoral offices, such as the Rockefeller 100 Resilient Cities initiative, or by exploring the potential of public-private partnerships like social impact bonds.

Another approach funders could consider against the rising air pollution is supporting entrepreneurial challenges that encourage collaboration on innovative solutions to tackle planetary health challenges.

Education and research institutions should accelerate efforts to build their pipeline of intersectional thinkers through joint degree programs or courses.

Existing examples include Sunway University’s development of a planetary health curriculum, for all undergraduate students irrespective of degree. We also recommend an increase in funding for catalytic planetary health research across disciplines, and in partnership with non-academic collaborators.",,[],"['David Duong', 'Tolu Oni', 'Written By', 'Elias Biryabarema', 'Elizabeth Claire Alberts', 'Roderick Weller', 'Katharina', 'Buchholz', 'Andrea Willige']"
Pollution and crops,"Usually, increasing agricultural productivity depends on adding something, such as fertilizer or water. A new Stanford University-led study reveals that removing one thing in particular – a common air pollutant – could lead to dramatic gains in crop yields. The analysis, published June 1 in Science Advances, uses satellite images to reveal for the first time how nitrogen oxides – gases found in car exhaust and industrial emissions – affect crop productivity. Its findings have important implications for increasing agricultural output and analyzing climate change mitigation costs and benefits around the world.

Go to the web site to view the video.

Video by Lindsay Filgas and Rob Jordan Research led by David Lobell finds that areas around the globe with high amounts of nitrogen oxides pollution see significant declines in crop yields. This shows that reducing nitrogen oxides pollution is not only good for the climate and for health but also for food security.

“Nitrogen oxides are invisible to humans, but new satellites have been able to map them with incredibly high precision. Since we can also measure crop production from space, this opened up the chance to rapidly improve our knowledge of how these gases affect agriculture in different regions,” said study lead author David Lobell, the Gloria and Richard Kushel Director of Stanford’s Center on Food Security and the Environment.

A NOx-ious problem

Nitrogen oxides, or NOx, are among the most widely emitted pollutants in the world. These gases can directly damage crop cells and indirectly affect them through their role as precursors to formation of ozone, an airborne toxin known to reduce crop yields, and particulate matter aerosols that can absorb and scatter sunlight away from crops.

While scientists have long had a general understanding of nitrogen oxides’ potential for damage, little is known about their actual impacts on agricultural productivity. Past research has been limited by a lack of overlap between air monitoring stations and agricultural areas, and confounding effects of different pollutants, among other challenges to ground-based analysis.

To avoid these limitations, Lobell and his colleagues combined satellite measures of crop greenness and nitrogen dioxide levels for 2018-2020. Nitrogen dioxide is the primary form of NOx and a good measure of total NOx. Although NOx is invisible to humans, nitrogen dioxide has a distinct interaction with ultraviolet light that has enabled satellite measurements of the gas at a much higher spatial and temporal resolution than for any other air pollutant.

“In addition to being more easily measured than other pollutants, nitrogen dioxide has the nice feature of being a primary pollutant, meaning it is directly emitted rather than formed in the atmosphere,” said study co-author Jennifer Burney, an associate professor of environmental science at the University of California, San Diego. “That means relating emissions to impacts is much more straightforward than for other pollutants.”

Calculating crop impacts

Based on their observations, the researchers estimated that reducing NOx emissions by about half in each region would improve yields by about 25% for winter crops and 15% for summer crops in China, nearly 10% for both winter and summer crops in Western Europe, and roughly 8% for summer crops and 6% for winter crops in India. North and South America generally had the lowest NOx exposures. Overall, the effects seemed most negative in seasons and locations where NOx likely drives ozone formation.",,[],"['Stanford University', 'Rob Jordan']"
"Car tyres produce vastly more particle pollution than exhausts, tests show","Almost 2,000 times more particle pollution is produced by tyre wear than is pumped out of the exhausts of modern cars, tests have shown.

The tyre particles pollute air, water and soil and contain a wide range of toxic organic compounds, including known carcinogens, the analysts say, suggesting tyre pollution could rapidly become a major issue for regulators.

Air pollution causes millions of early deaths a year globally. The requirement for better filters has meant particle emissions from tailpipes in developed countries are now much lower in new cars, with those in Europe far below the legal limit. However, the increasing weight of cars means more particles are being thrown off by tyres as they wear on the road.

The tests also revealed that tyres produce more than 1tn ultrafine particles for each kilometre driven, meaning particles smaller than 23 nanometres. These are also emitted from exhausts and are of special concern to health, as their size means they can enter organs via the bloodstream. Particles below 23nm are hard to measure and are not currently regulated in either the EU or US.

“Tyres are rapidly eclipsing the tailpipe as a major source of emissions from vehicles,” said Nick Molden, at Emissions Analytics, the leading independent emissions testing company that did the research. “Tailpipes are now so clean for pollutants that, if you were starting out afresh, you wouldn’t even bother regulating them.”

Molden said an initial estimate of tyre particle emissions prompted the new work. “We came to a bewildering amount of material being released into the environment – 300,000 tonnes of tyre rubber in the UK and US, just from cars and vans every year.”

There are currently no regulations on the wear rate of tyres and little regulation on the chemicals they contain. Emissions Analytics has now determined the chemicals present in 250 different types of tyres, which are usually made from synthetic rubber, derived from crude oil. “There are hundreds and hundreds of chemicals, many of which are carcinogenic,” Molden said. “When you multiply it by the total wear rates, you get to some very staggering figures as to what’s being released.”

The wear rate of different tyre brands varied substantially and the toxic chemical content varied even more, he said, showing low-cost changes were feasible to cut their environmental impact.

“You could do a lot by eliminating the most toxic tyres,” he said. “It’s not about stopping people driving, or having to invent completely different new tyres. If you could eliminate the worst half, and maybe bring them in line with the best in class, you can make a massive difference. But at the moment, there’s no regulatory tool, there’s no surveillance.”

The tests of tyre wear were done on 14 different brands using a Mercedes C-Class driven normally on the road, with some tested over their full lifetime. High-precision scales measured the weight lost by the tyres and a sampling system that collects particles behind the tyres while driving assessed the mass, number and size of particles, down to 6nm. The real-world exhaust emissions were measured across four petrol SUVs, the most popular new cars today, using models from 2019 and 2020.

Used tyres produced 36 milligrams of particles each kilometre, 1,850 times higher than the 0.02 mg/km average from the exhausts. A very aggressive – though legal – driving style sent particle emissions soaring, to 5,760 mg/km.

Far more small particles are produced by the tyres than large ones. This means that while the vast majority of the particles by number are small enough to become airborne and contribute to air pollution, these represent only 11% of the particles by weight. Nonetheless, tyres still produce hundreds of times more airborne particles by weight than the exhausts.

The average weight of all cars has been increasing. But there has been particular debate over whether battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which are heavier than conventional cars and can have greater wheel torque, may lead to more tyre particles being produced. Molden said it would depend on driving style, with gentle EV drivers producing fewer particles than fossil-fuelled cars driven badly, though on average he expected slightly higher tyre particles from BEVs.

Dr James Tate, at the University of Leeds’ Institute for Transport Studies in the UK, said the tyre test results were credible. “But it is very important to note that BEVs are becoming lighter very fast,” he said. “By 2024-25 we expect BEVs and [fossil-fuelled] city cars will have comparable weights. Only high-end, large BEVs with high capacity batteries will weigh more.”

Other recent research has suggested tyre particles are a major source of the microplastics polluting the oceans. A specific chemical used in tyres has been linked to salmon deaths in the US and California proposed a ban this month.

“The US is more advanced in their thinking about [the impacts of tyre particles],” said Molden. “The European Union is behind the curve. Overall, it’s early days, but this could be a big issue.”",,[],['Damian Carrington']
Satellite imagery shows air pollution rise in tropical ‘megacities’,"A new international study has used satellites to track air pollution changes in some of the world’s fast-growing tropical cities. Some of these cities will house more than 50 million people by 2050, but there is almost no on-the-ground measurement of what people are breathing.

We are all used to seeing satellite images on television weather forecasts. They are also used routinely to track dust storms including arrival of Saharan dust in the UK, and even across the Atlantic, as well as tracking wildfire smoke.

Mark Parrington, a senior scientist with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, explained: “Earth observation provides us with up-to-date information on locations and emissions of wildfires and the distribution of key pollutants in the atmosphere, as well as the weather. Satellites provide almost 800 million data points around the world every day, including in very inaccessible regions.”

But measuring air pollution that we breathe from space is difficult as the satellite has to look though the whole column of air underneath it, making it hard to estimate pollution in the bottom few metres where we live. The satellites rely on reflected sunlight and can therefore only make measurements in daytime. Clouds get in the way too. And yet, despite these limitations, in previous studies satellites have uncovered pollution that we didn’t know about close to home, such as agriculture pollution from sugar beet farms in France.

Air pollution has got far worse in 46 future megacities in tropical Africa, Asia and the Middle East, the study reveals. The deterioration in air quality has led to 180,000 extra deaths due to the combination of city expansion and worsening air pollution between 2005 and 2018.

Agricultural burning from the areas around the cities is one of the main causes. But the deterioration is driven mostly by new sources such as fertiliser use in nearby farms and increased transport and industry. Problems with waste burning, including the burning of plastics, are widespread too. Cities in India are also being affected by new coal power stations that are being built in the country.

Some cities are taking action. Last month, 10 African cities signed up to the C40 clean air declaration. Signatory cities recognise the right to clean air, pledge to take action to reduce pollution and report their progress. They are now part of a network of 46 cities that are taking a science-led approach and working together to tackle our climate emergency, reduce air pollution and address inequalities.",,[],['Gary Fuller']
Patent Pick: Unilever Standardizes Pollution Protection Factor for Cosmetics,"There remains an unmet need for a robust and reliable method to standardize the pollution protection factor measurement of any composition for use as a tool to assess/grade cosmetics based on their efficacy.

According to Unilever inventors, while a variety of test methods has been developed to measure the efficacy of anti-pollution cosmetics and cosmetic ingredients, there is no standardized method for this assessment. As such, the company has patented a method to determine the pollution protection factor (PPF) of products.

Market Need

As the patent explains, pollutants including particulate matter, black carbon, ground-level ozone and oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur can adversely affect human skin, causing premature aging, hyperpigmentation, the formation of rashes and inflammation, etc. While various cosmetic compositions claim to prevent, inhibit or restrict the particulate pollutants from contacting skin, it is important to be able to substantiate such claims with evidence.

In response, manufacturing companies and academic researchers have developed methods of testing/analyzing or verifying the efficacy of such compositions. However, there remains an unmet need for a robust and reliable method to standardize the PPF measurement of any composition for use as a tool to assess/grade cosmetics based on their efficacy. The present invention addresses this need.

The pollution from Russia’s war will poison Ukraine for decades,"In late May, a large plume of pink smoke erupted from a chemical plant and rose above apartment buildings in Ukraine’s eastern city of Severodonetsk. The smoke was toxic — it came from a tank of nitric acid that was struck by Russian military forces.

“Do not come out of shelters!” the region’s governor, Sergiy Gaiday, said on Telegram, following the attack. “Nitric acid is dangerous if inhaled, swallowed, and in contact with skin.”

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, exploding chemical plants have become a frightening reality for its citizens, but they’re just one example of the staggering toll that war is taking on the nation’s environment. Rockets are polluting the soil and groundwater; fires threaten to expel radioactive particles; and warships have reportedly killed dolphins in the Black Sea.

Though not as visible as the thousands of lost lives, the environmental costs of war are insidious, quietly harming people and wildlife for decades after fighting stops. Indeed, armed conflict is one of the leading predictors of animal declines and a major source of greenhouse gas emissions (the US military alone emits countries’ worth of carbon dioxide). War is also linked to human health problems, including cancer and birth defects.

Ukrainian environmental groups are keeping track of the damage, which some experts say amount to war crimes. So far, they’ve logged nearly 270 cases of potential harm, ranging from damage to power plants to impacts on marine ecosystems. Now, the question is: Will Russia be held accountable for them?

An environmental crisis in Ukraine

Ukraine covers less than 6 percent of Europe’s land area, but it’s home to more than a third of the continent’s biodiversity. It’s also highly industrialized, with hundreds of chemical plants, nearly 150 coal mines, and more than a dozen nuclear reactors — including Europe’s largest.

So, one obvious problem is the destruction of these facilities. In March, shelling in the northern Ukrainian town of Novoselytsya caused an ammonia leak at a fertilizer factory, threatening residents by contaminating groundwater and soil. Then there are those exploding tanks of nitric acid. Meanwhile, damage to coal-fired power plants can cause electrical water pumps to fail, allowing contaminated water in mines to spill over and pollute the groundwater.

(In 2014, Russia fueled a separatist movement in the coal and steel-producing region of Ukraine called Donbas. A year later, the UN estimated that it would cost roughly $70 million to clean up the environment and restore the water supply, Al Jazeera reported.)

Russia has also attacked oil and gas storage facilities, lighting up the sky with explosions that pollute the air and release carbon dioxide. (This video shows the aftermath of an attack on an oil terminal and a gas pipeline.)

The stuff inside the rockets that both sides are using can poison the environment, too, according to the Ukrainian advocacy group Center for Environmental Initiatives Ecoaction. When they explode, artillery rockets can produce a number of noxious substances including hydrogen cyanide vapor and nitrogen oxides, which can cause acid rain, Ecoaction said.

In April, the Ukrainian army shot down a Russian missile, and some of the debris fell on an agricultural site, leaking toxic chemicals into the soil and water, CNN’s Ivana Kottasová reported. Officials told people living nearby not to drink water from wells and there were reports of dead fish in a river several miles away, Kottasová reported.

“Now and in the future, heavy metals will be in our groundwater and soil,” Evgenia Zasiadko, who leads Ecoaction’s climate work, told the nonprofit Global Citizen. “We’re an agricultural country, and when it’s not an active war, I don’t know how we’re going to rebuild anything because it’s going to be polluted.”

Can Ukraine get reparations for “environmental crimes”?

While war might seem lawless, it’s actually governed by a set of international laws including the Geneva Conventions, some of which prohibit severe and lasting damage to the environment. Under some circumstances, the International Criminal Court (ICC) considers those actions war crimes.

Countries have used these laws to seek environmental reparations before. In 1991, amid the Gulf War, Iraqi military forces set fire to hundreds of oil wells in Kuwait and intentionally spilled millions of barrels into the Persian Gulf.

The environmental toll was staggering: tens of thousands of tons of sulfur dioxide and smoke poisoned the air, driving up respiratory illnesses and damaging crops. Hundreds of sea birds perished. In response, the UN ordered Iraq to pay Kuwait around $3 billion, as part of a much larger reparations package (that Iraq finished paying in February).

But it’s incredibly hard to prove that environmental damage violates international law, Shireen Daft, an expert in international law and lecturer at Macquarie University, told Vox. Ukraine would have to show that the destruction is “widespread, long-term, and severe,” she said.

And even then, there’s no easy route to prosecute Russia, she added. The ICC tries individuals, not nations, and Ukraine will also face hurdles if it seeks environmental reparations through the UN’s International Court of Justice, she said.

“The law is lacking the strength needed to provide concrete protection to the environment,” Daft said. “And in a situation like Ukraine, where there is so much potential for environmental damage, that is deeply concerning.”

That’s one reason why some scientists have called for a new Geneva Convention that more explicitly enshrines protections for the environment during war. A division of the UN called the International Law Commission has also developed a set of non-binding principles that help clarify how international war laws apply to the environment.

Other experts, however, are confident that the global community will hold Russia accountable, one way or another. Russia’s actions toward the environment violate the laws of war, said Carroll Muffett, president and CEO of the nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law, especially considering that the war itself is illegal under international laws (because it’s a war of aggression).

“It may take months or years or even decades, but Russia will be held accountable for this,” Muffett told Vox. “I don’t see how Russia avoids that outcome.”",,[],"['Benji Jones', 'Emily Stewart', 'Umair Irfan', 'Neel Dhanesha', 'Vox Communications', 'Rebecca Jennings', 'Jun']"
Block-by-block data shows pollution’s stark toll on people of color,"Placeholder while article actions load

Finding the most polluted places in the San Francisco Bay area is simple, a new air quality analysis shows: Locate places where mostly Black, Latino, Asian and low-income residents live, and pay them a visit. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight The data released Tuesday by Aclima — a California-based tech company that measured the region’s air quality block-by-block for the first time — found that communities of color are exposed to 55 percent more nitrogen dioxide, which contributes to smog, than mostly White communities.

While the Environmental Protection Agency gauges an area’s air quality with fixed monitors, the new survey unearthed more granular data by sending low-emission vehicles equipped with sophisticated technology to traverse neighborhoods at least 20 times each. These forays revealed that poor people of all ethnicities experience a 30 percent higher exposure to nitrogen dioxide compared to wealthier residents, and concentrations can vary up to 800 percent from one end of a block to the next.

The painstaking examination, partly funded by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District through a $6 million contract, took more than a year. The company’s fleet traversed every city block in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and other municipalities to determine the true extent of pollution.

What they discovered was that the farther their mobile air monitors traveled away from the region’s more than two dozen stationary air quality monitors, the more they detected elevated levels of pollution that the fixed monitors missed. Their data questions the reliability of the system the EPA uses to surveil the air that millions of Americans breathe.

“The regulatory stationary network is not inherently designed to provide a detailed picture of air pollution at the street, community or block area level,” the analysis said.

It found that the entire Bay Area is exposed to higher levels of floating microscopic pollutants, fine particulate matter, than World Health Organization guidelines recommend. These particles, known as PM2.5, can penetrate the lungs and cause numerous respiratory diseases such as asthma.

Aclima compared its data to an international benchmark, which is far more restrictive than federal standards. The WHO sets its standard for nitrogen dioxide, NO2, at 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air compared with the EPA’s 100.

EPA limits the annual average exposure to fine particulate matter to 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air, compared with the WHO’s 5 micrograms. During the Trump administration, EPA staff recommended lowering the annual federal threshold to between 8 and 10 micrograms per cubic meter, but the Trump administration kept the standard set in 2012.

For decades, Black, Latino, Asian, Native Americans and low-income White residents have said deadly pollution in and around their homes has been their reality. They have questioned national air quality standards and data from fixed air quality monitors that said the concentration of pollution is acceptable.

“That’s not what the community is experiencing,” Veronica Eady, senior deputy executive officer for policy and equity at the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, said about the data. “We suspected some of these things but we didn’t have this,"" she said, referring to the community-scale granular data. “We’re taking this pivot to add additional tools to the toolbox to improve public health.”

During the many years before the pivot to monitoring pollution block-by-block near the source, there were “people dying that didn’t have to die,” said Margaret Gordon, a community activist and co-director of the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project. Data provided by hyperlocal monitoring could have led to better planning and siting of pollution sources “where people work live and pray,” Gordon said.

In the area around the project’s office, bracketed by freeways and a major shipping port that serves as a destination for diesel trucks, the level of nitrogen dioxide pollution is 10.5 parts per billion, according to Aclima’s analysis. That lies well below the EPA standard but exceeds international guidelines.

The air quality is much better in one block of the mostly White Oakland Hills, which is far from freeways and the port. At 4.5 parts per billion, the nitrogen dioxide level lies below WHO’s standard, according to Aclima’s data, and the neighborhood’s PM2.5 concentration is at the global threshold.

Aclima ended its first phase of air quality mapping in 2021, when its researchers started to analyze the data. In addition to capturing the heavier pollution burden borne by Latino, Asian American and Black residents, it showed higher exposure for White and non-White residents who either rent their homes, live at two times below the federal poverty line or both.

These patterns are clear in Santa Clara County, home to racially diverse San Jose and Gilroy, a majority White exurb 33 miles south.

Both areas have elevated levels of particulate matter. In Gilroy, major highways slice through fields and farmland dotted by homes, and in San Jose, highways cut through minority and disadvantaged communities.

Dust also hangs in the air over Gilroy, kicked up by farming practices, and San Jose’s traffic pollution is exacerbated by a natural air basin that traps particulate matter from fires during wildfire season.

About an hour north in Alameda County, which includes Oakland, around 70 percent of the 180,000 Black residents “live in areas with nitrogen dioxide higher than the latest World Health Organization guideline,” the analysis said. That compares to about 40 percent of its White residents.

A growing body of scientific evidence suggests a link between breathing pollution, developing a severe illness and becoming infected or dying from covid-19. A study of 425 young adults, published last month in Sweden, found that brief exposures were “associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection despite relatively low levels of air pollution exposure.”

Sacoby Wilson, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health who serves on Aclima’s environmental justice advisory board, called stationary air quality monitoring “a problem.”

“It’s really a poor approach,” he said. “We call it ‘exposure misclassification.’ ” When you compare the levels of pollution Aclima found to WHO guidelines, Wilson said, “It’s like, ‘Oh my God.’ It’s not just a race issue. You have to look at both race and income.”

The company’s hyperlocal monitoring is well ahead of the EPA, he added. “What they’re doing is new because it’s mobile based.”

The EPA, he said, is “30 to 40 years behind where they need to be.”

Bay Area officials defended the monitors they have in place, saying they accurately reflect the region’s pollution. Aclima’s scientists agreed, saying that when their mobile monitors drove near stationary monitors they collected similar data.

But as their cars drove farther away into communities, the discrepancies were undeniable.

Aclima has deployed its fleet of more than 150 air monitoring vehicles in other regions in the state, such as greater Los Angeles and San Diego. In the near future, company officials said, it will share results from large-scale hyperlocal pollution studies in the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic between Virginia and New York, and in the South.

State and local government agencies, utilities, community groups and private companies like Google are interested in its data collection, said Davida Herzl, Aclima’s co-founder and chief executive, whose firm started operations in 2010.

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District turned to Aclima when a 2017 state law gave local agencies hundreds of millions of dollars to identify areas overburdened with pollution.

Nitrogen dioxide is mostly generated by heavy traffic such as cars, industrial trucks and other pollution sources. They are a constant presence on Interstate 880, which cuts through West Oakland’s high concentration of Black neighborhoods.

Under the rules of the California Department of Transportation, known as CalTrans, White people in Oakland are essentially guaranteed to breathe cleaner air. Heavy trucks have never been allowed on Interstate 580, which snakes around a higher concentration of White communities.

Racial disparities were also evident in San Francisco, where pollution in both the freeway-adjacent Tenderloin and Mission districts is significantly higher compared with areas such as the mostly White and higher-income Castro and Noe Valley, which sit far from major roads.

The history of the Tenderloin and Mission are a major part of that story, said Melissa Lunden, Aclima’s chief scientist. They were identified as undesirable areas by the federal Home Owners Loan Corporation in the 1940s for having too many Mexican, Asian and Russian immigrants, as well as Black people.

After they were redlined as areas where lending should be avoided, freeways, heavy industry and higher pollution soon followed. “West Oakland didn’t have freeways before the redlining maps, but it does now,” Lunden said.

Environmental justice activists have suspected a tie between redlining and pollution for decades: Researchers from five universities confirmed those suspicions in a major study last year.

The analysis found that 45 million Americans who live in areas that were formerly redlined are breathing dirtier air. Compared with White people, Black and Latino Americans live with more smog and fine particulate matter from cars, trucks, buses, coal plants and other nearby industrial sources in areas that were redlined.

Like Margaret Gordon in Oakland, the researchers noted that stationary air quality monitors failed to record the extent of the pollution in those overburdened areas. That, Herzl said, is about to change because of technology like Aclima’s.

“This represents a breakthrough in how we can manage the health of our environment in a data-driven and human-centered way,” Herzl said, noting that the nation’s air enforcement system was established a half-century ago. “The world has changed a lot in that time.”

Eat These Vegetables To Reduce Air Pollution Toxins in Your Body,"Toxins from cigarette smoke and air pollution may be absorbed by celery, carrots, parsnips, and parsley.

Air pollution is defined as the release of pollutants into the atmosphere that is harmful to human health and the environment as a whole. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution causes the death of seven million people per year throughout the globe. Nine out of ten people breathe air that exceeds the WHO’s pollution guideline levels, with those in low- and middle-income nations having it the worst.

People who are exposed to air pollution suffer from a variety of health problems. Illnesses such as pneumonia or bronchitis are examples of short-term repercussions. Irritation to the nose, throat, eyes, or skin as well as Headaches, dizziness, and nausea are all symptoms of air pollution. Air pollution’s long-term consequences can continue for years or even a lifetime. They can even result in a person’s death.

Luckily, a University of Delaware researcher has identified a strategy to reduce the impact of air pollution on our bodies by increasing our regular consumption of vegetables such as celery, carrots, parsnips, and parsley.

Jae Kyeom Kim, assistant professor of behavioral health and nutrition, investigated how apiaceous vegetables protect the body from the accumulation of acrolein, an irritant to the lungs and skin with a strong unpleasant odor that is abundant in cigarette smoke and automobile exhaust, in a new article published in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry.

Kim and his colleagues investigated how apiaceous vegetables, which are rich in phytonutrients, alleviated acrolein-induced toxicities through a series of tests. The findings demonstrated how acrolein-induced oxidative stress might be decreased and its consequences minimized.

“Kim’s research discovered that apiaceous vegetables supported detoxification through an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity,” Trabulsi said. “The results suggest that apiaceous vegetables may provide protection against acrolein-induced damages and inflammation because, in the liver, the vegetables enhance the conversion of acrolein into a water-soluble acid for bodily excretion.”

The next step was to determine a reasonable dosage amount for humans. Looking forward, Kim plans to integrate human intervention trials.

“When we calculated this, we determined the actual daily calorie amount of apiaceous vegetables for humans is roughly 1 and 1/3 cups per day,” Kim said. “It doesn’t require a high intake to see a difference, and this is an achievable amount in daily life.”

Kim and his team stress the importance of implementing behavioral changes in diet as a solution to combat the buildup of toxicants derived from air pollution.

“Research has identified that it is the totality of nutrients in fruits and vegetables that support beneficial health outcomes, rather than a single nutrient,” Trabulsi said. “Focusing on a healthy whole food diet is more impactful than relying on individual supplements.”

ATLANTIC SKIES: How light pollution impacts what Atlantic Canadians can see in the night sky,"Astronomers, and especially astro-photographers, are keenly aware that the level of light pollution in proximity to their area of observation or photography greatly impacts the quality of the night sky above them and to what magnitude they can observe and/or photograph.

Most people are aware of the difference in what they can see in the night sky in an urban/suburban setting versus what they can see under a dark sky in a rural setting; the mere number of stars visible, let alone other celestial objects, is often overwhelming for an urban dweller who moves to or visits a rural area.

Sky brightness is the visual perception of the sky and how the sky scatters and diffuses light. This brightness varies greatly, depending on factors such as geographic location (latitude, longitude and elevation), presence of nearby urban and/or industrial centers, time of night, season, and dark adaptation (of observer).

The night sky is never completely dark; sources of the night sky's intrinsic brightness include airglow (the faint emissions of self-illuminating gases in a planet's atmosphere), indirect scattering of sunlight, the scattering of starlight, and, most significantly, light pollution. It's the primary reason observatories are located in remote areas around the globe, usually at high elevations and at considerable distances from urban centres, although, as time passes, even these remote places are falling victim to increasing light pollution.

How to measure sky brightness

There are numerous methods and tools used to measure the quality or brightness of the night sky, i.e., the amount of light pollution impacting the view of the night sky at any given location.

Various instruments, such as portable sky quality metres, can be purchased to provide a localized measurement of the night sky brightness. There are also a number of online light pollution maps available which allow an observer to plot a specific location on a global map for a zenith (the point in the sky directly overhead an observer) sky brightness reading. Nowadays, you can even measure the sky brightness via a smartphone app (e.g., Clear Outside), which uses your GPS coordinates to provide you with a reasonably accurate scale reading of the brightness of the sky above you at any given time on any given night.

Events:

June 14 - Full ""Strawberry Moon""; Moon at perigee (closest to Earth)

June 16 - Mercury at its greatest elongation west of the sun

June 18 - Saturn to left of waning moon; pre-dawn southeast sky

While there are a number of brightness scales that have been developed for use by astronomers and astro-photographers, the scale most user-friendly to amateur astronomers is the Bortle Scale.

Developed in 2001 by American amateur astronomer John E. Bortle, this scale utilizes practical celestial observations (as opposed to complicated formulas) to estimate the overall quality or brightness of the night sky. It was published in the July 2006 issue of the Sky and Telescope magazine (to read a copy of this article, go to https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-resources/light-pollution-and-astronomy-the-bortle-dark-sky-scale/).

What's the Bortle Scale?

The Bortle Scale has nine classes, with Class 1 having the least light pollution, and Class 9 having the most. The Astrobackyard.com site gives a breakdown of each class, which can be summarized as follows:

Class 1: Referred to as an ""excellent dark sky site,"" the Zodiacal Light and Gegenschien are easily visible; the M33 galaxy is visible to the naked-eye with direct vision; and the Scorpius and Sagittarius regions of the Milky Way cast diffuse shadows on the ground.

Class 2: ""Typical True Dark Site"" - the summer Milky Way is highly structured to the unaided-eye; the Zodiacal Light is bright enough to cast faint shadows; the brightest regions of the Milky Way look like ""veined marble"" in binoculars; clouds in the sky are visible only as dark holes in the starry backdrop; and several Messier globular star clusters are visible to the naked-eye

Class 3: ""Rural Sky"" - slight signs of light pollution along the horizon; clouds appear faintly illuminated; the Milky Way still appears complex; globular star clusters M4, M5, M15 and M22 all distinct naked-eye objects; M33 easily seen with averted vision; and the Zodiacal Light is bright in spring and autumn skies.

Class 4: ""Rural/Suburban Transition Area"" - fairly obvious light pollution domes over populated centers; Zodiacal Light clearly evident, but doesn't extend half-way to zenith; Milky Way high above horizon still impressive, but lacks all but most obvious structure; M33 is a difficult averted-vision object; and clouds are only slightly illuminated.

Class 5: ""Suburban Sky"" - hints of Zodiacal Light seen on clearest spring/autumn nights; Milky Way very weak or invisible near horizon, and looks washed-out overhead; light sources evident in most, if not all, directions; and clouds are noticeably brighter than the sky itself.

Class 6: ""Bright Suburban Sky"" - no trace of Zodiacal Light; Milky Way only apparent towards zenith; sky within 35 degrees of horizon glows greyish-white; clouds anywhere in the sky appear fairly bright; M33 impossible to see in binoculars; and M31 only modestly apparent to naked-eye.

Class 7: ""Suburban/Urban Transition Area"" - entire sky background has vague, greyish-white hue; strong light sources evident in all directions; Milky Way totally or nearly invisible; M44 and M31 may be glimpsed with unaided-eye, but indistinct; clouds are brilliantly lit; and brightest Messier objects are dim, even in moderate-sized telescopes.

Class 8: ""City Sky"" - the night sky glows whitish-grey or orange; only brightest Messier objects detectable with moderate-sized telescope by an experienced observer on a good night; and some of the stars in the most familiar constellations may be difficult to see.

Class 9: ""Inner-city Sky"" - entire sky brightly lit, even at zenith; some stars in the constellation patterns invisible; dim constellations (e.g., Cancer and Pisces) not seen at all; except for the Pleiades (the ""Seven Sisters"") star cluster, no Messier objects visible to the unaided-eye; and the belt stars in Orion are only just visible.

The next night you are out observing, try to determine what the quality or brightness of the night sky above you is by referring to the above classes. If you are an astro-photographer, and don't already know about the Bortle Scale (or a similar sky brightness scale), you should familiarize yourself with it; it could greatly improve the quality and detail of your night sky photos.

This week's sky

Mercury, very low on the eastern horizon at dawn, is not visible in the pre-dawn sky this week.

Saturn (magnitude +0.7, in Capricorn - the Sea Goat) rises in the east-southeast around 12:30 a.m., reaching 27 degrees altitude in the southern sky before it fades into the brightening dawn sky by about 4:30 a.m. On June 18th, Saturn sits to the left of the waning moon in the southeast, pre-dawn sky.

Jupiter (magnitude -2.3, in Pisces - the Fish) rises in the east around 2:15 a.m. and gains a height of approximately 28 degrees above the southeast horizon before fading from view around 5 a.m.

Mars (magnitude +0.6, in Cetus - the Sea Monster) rises in the eastern sky around 2:30 a.m., reaching 21 degrees above the horizon before disappearing into the approaching dawn by about 4:30 a.m.

Our ""morning star"" Venus (magnitude -4.0, in Aries - the Ram) makes its appearance in the east-northeast sky somewhere around 4 a.m., only achieving a height of 11 degrees above the horizon before succumbing to the dawn shortly after 5 a.m.

The full moon on June 14 was referred to as the ""Strawberry Moon"" by the Algonquin, Ojibwe, Dakota, and Lakota peoples in the American northeast, as this was the month that the wild strawberries were usually harvested.

Until next week, clear skies.

Exposure to air pollution can worsen patient outcomes from COVID-19,"Study by researchers of Keck School of Medicine of USC and Kaiser Permanente Southern California finds link between exposure to airborne particulate matter and increased risk of serious coronavirus complications

By Jeremy Deutchman

Data from a new USC study shows a significant increase in the risk of severe outcomes for COVID-19 patients exposed to fine particles (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), two common (and correlated) components of ambient air pollution in Southern California. Produced by ground and air traffic, industrial burning and other sources, these air pollutants can exacerbate the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus over both the short and long term.

“Our research demonstrated that one-year average exposure to PM2.5 translated to a 20-30 percent increase in the risk of hospitalization, intensive respiratory support and ICU admissions from COVID-19. Exposure to NO2 for one month carried an increased risk of 12-18 percent,” said Zhanghua Chen, assistant professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and co-first author of the study. “We also saw that long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19.”

The study appears in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

Researchers collaborated with Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) to examine a cohort of more than 74,000 COVID-19 patients diagnosed from March to August 2020. With detailed residential address history linked to Kaiser Permanente members’ electronic medical records (EMR), investigators were able to accurately predict exposure history for specific pollutants.

Individual-level results

Earlier in the pandemic, a number of studies using national data in ecological analyses found a link between long-term air pollution exposure and increased COVID-19 incidence and mortality. However, this approach raised important questions and concerns.

“Ecological analyses are subject to a lot of biases, and it wasn’t clear whether the findings could be applied beyond the community level,” Chen said. “In our population cohort study, we were able to leverage the sophistication of EMR to create a well-defined classification of the severity of COVID-19 outcomes tied to air pollution exposure at the individual level.”

The results were clear, noted coauthor and Professor of Population and Public Health Sciences Frank Gilliland, MD, PhD. “Our study demonstrates that breathing clean air may reduce the severity of the infection. When someone is infected, reducing their exposure to air pollutants maybe beneficial, as it may decrease the risk for poor outcomes and also has many other health benefits.”

A compelling cohort

In addition to providing individual-level results, utilizing the Kaiser Permanente cohort for the study conferred other benefits as well. “Kaiser Permanente has enriched patient background information – also known as covariates – encompassing factors including race, ethnicity, sex and socioeconomic status, which enabled us to adjust for social demographics and comorbidities like diabetes, obesity and asthma,” said corresponding author Anny Xiang, PhD, MS, a senior research scientist at KPSC’s Department of Research & Evaluation. “Also, whereas other studies were more focused on older populations, which are more susceptible to COVID-19, ours has a much broader representation of age range because Kaiser Permanente covers such a large percentage of Southern California residents.”

Based on their findings, Chen and her colleagues now plan to examine intervention approaches – such as using air purifiers – to reduce individual levels of PM2.5 exposure. “We’re starting some crossover clinical trials to investigate these types of strategies on a personal level, to see whether they can help reduce cardiometabolic disease risk,” she said.

Additional authors of the study include Brian Huang, Sandrah Eckel, Roya Gheissari and Duncan Thomas from Keck School of Medicine; Margo Sidell, Ting Chow, and Mayra Martinez from Kaiser Permanente Southern California; and Fred Lurmann from Sonoma Technology, Inc.

Indoor Air Pollution in the Time of Coronavirus,"Knowing that an invisible, infectious virus may be lingering in the air of a stuffy room is an unsettling thing.

But even more unsettling is not knowing it could be there.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the world was unaware the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could be transmitted through the air. Following public health guidance, we dutifully washed our hands and kept our distance; some of us disinfected surfaces and even our groceries.

But the coronavirus was not just transmitted through short-range droplets emitted through coughing or sneezing.

Aerosol and atmospheric scientists from around the world were the first to sound the alarm on airborne transmission of coronavirus: Fine aerosol particles carrying the virus could linger and accumulate in the air for minutes to hours. Anyone sharing the space—even if they were farther away than the social distancing standard of 2 meters (6 feet)—could be at risk for inhaling these infected air particles.

Heightening interest in indoor air quality could save millions of lives—and prepare us for the next airborne pandemic.

But even before we began masking and avoiding crowded spaces, bad indoor air quality was already responsible for millions of deaths and debilitating health issues. And though we spend 90% of our time indoors, there is generally a lack of appreciation and awareness of the importance of the air around us. The composition of our indoor air matters to our health, whether it contains novel coronavirus or pollutants. But unlike outdoor air, the quality of the air we breathe indoors is not regulated.

If water is contaminated, we can still purchase bottled water, said Lidia Morawska, a physicist at Queensland University of Technology in Australia who runs an air quality lab specializing in airborne particulate matter. “But we have absolutely no choice on air we breathe. And we breathe continuously: If we stopped breathing for 3 minutes, we’ll die. That’s the importance of indoor air quality,” she said.

The revelation that COVID-19 can spread through the air could provide the attention and momentum needed to clear our indoor air for good. Some countries, such as Taiwan, already have regulations addressing indoor air quality. Others, such as Finland, are pursuing a holistic strategy involving health care and educational outreach as well as standards for managing air quality in indoor environments. In March 2022, the Biden administration launched the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, calling on building owners and operators to adopt key strategies for improving indoor air quality as part of a broader strategy for reducing the spread of COVID-19.

Heightening interest in indoor air quality could save millions of lives—and prepare us for the next airborne pandemic.

“You know, it’s really too bad [awareness] took so long to get here,” said Linsey Marr, an expert on airborne transmission of viruses at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. “But at the same time…I thought it would take a generation, I thought it would take 30 years for us to come this far if there had not been a pandemic.”

Aerosol Scientists Sound the Alarm

At the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, most public health agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), did not recognize airborne transmission—aerosol particles laden with infectious agents that can travel over long distances and time through the air—as a viable route for spreading COVID-19. Instead, the focus was on mitigating risk from large respiratory droplets that, expelled by coughs or sneezes, would fall quickly to the ground, leading to recommendations for handwashing and physical distancing.

But for many aerosol and atmospheric scientists, airborne transmission was not only a possibility but also the most likely explanation for the pattern of spread.

Superspreader events, such as the rehearsal of the Skagit Valley Chorale outside of Seattle, showed infections that could not be explained by close contact alone. Another well-documented case of COVID-19 spreading over long distances, through a poorly ventilated restaurant in Guangzhou, China, even included video recordings showing no close contact between infected people.

In addition, poorly ventilated indoor spaces, such as prisons and nursing homes, seemed to experience the worst outbreaks, whereas the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission was far lower outdoors than in.

“It was like, ‘Why, of course, it’s so obvious that it’s airborne,’” said Shelly Miller, an air pollution specialist and environmental engineer at the University of Colorado Boulder. “We were just flabbergasted that this was not something to be considered seriously.”

In the decades before COVID-19, researchers had demonstrated that viruses could be released, spread, and linger in aerosols for far longer and farther than was considered by health officials. “I think it was obvious to me and my colleagues because we understand the physics of airborne particles,” said Miller, lead author of the Skagit Valley Chorale study. “The particles don’t care what organism” they are—be it a fungus, bacterium, or novel coronavirus.

Before the pandemic, for example, Morawska carried around her own carbon dioxide meter to keep informed about the quality of the air surrounding her. “It’s so small it fits into any handbag I have,” she said. If someone was sick at a family gathering or in a staff meeting, she could ensure they were in a well-ventilated area and positioned where their exhaled air would not flow toward others. She would also mask up when she herself was ill.

Lidia Morawska runs an air quality lab specializing in airborne particulate matter.

“In reality, we knew that respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 spread through the air because they’re emitted from our respiratory activities—mouth, nose—when we speak, when we breathe, when we do anything else,” said Morawska, who has been an adviser on air quality to WHO since 1990. “There was really no disagreement, no question marks amongst scientists about this before the pandemic.”

However, finding direct evidence linking infected aerosols to disease spread is difficult, said Yuguo Li, a researcher of building environments at the University of Hong Kong and editor in chief of the journal Indoor Air.

For direct evidence, you would need to prove at least three things, said Li, who is part of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission. First, you need to show that someone infected breathed out aerosols. Second, you need to show that the aerosols in the space had sufficient viable virus in them. And third, you need to show that someone inhaled them and got infected. Even if all the mechanistic steps of transmission make sense, they are each difficult to prove.

“It’s difficult to get direct evidence [for airborne transmission] every time after this occurs,” Li said. “You cannot trace back the wind in your backyard 100 years ago.”

But there was still enough evidence to follow the precautionary principle for preventive action in the face of uncertainty. Li wondered: Are we going to wait around for definitive evidence when we know enough to take reasonable actions?

Throwing Caution to the Wind

In early March 2020, the director-general of WHO announced to the world that the coronavirus is not airborne. The organization had convened a committee to figure out how the virus is transmitted and how to prevent it, said Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemist and aerosol expert at the University of Colorado Boulder, noting that the committee had six experts on handwashing and zero on airborne transmission. At the end of March 2020, the WHO tweeted “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne.”

https://twitter.com/who/status/1243972193169616898?lang=en

For Morawska, this was a turning point and a realization that something had to be done.

Over the course of 3 days⁠—“I realized time is a factor”⁠—Morawska brought together a group of 36 scientists who signed a petition with the aim of convincing health authorities that the current scientific understanding was different from what WHO was saying.

“Experts were in agreement,” Morawska said, “that this virus, like any other respiratory virus, spreads through the air. It was the disagreement between public health authorities, who were basically spreading misinformation, and experts from many different areas, which were trying to correct this.”

The letter initially led to conversations with WHO but no further action.

“They yell at us, basically. They think we’re like the 5G [conspiracy] people,” said Jimenez, who was part of the group of 36. “They still meet with us, but they don’t take us seriously.”

The letter, signed by 239 aerosol and atmospheric scientists, was published in July 2020. Shortly after, WHO held a press conference acknowledging airborne transmission as a possibility, albeit with disclaimers that such spread is relatively rare.

“But the significance of this was that 3 months were lost, [a] critical 3 months, which means that public health authorities around the world didn’t do anything about their own transmission,” Morawska said.

Further, the letter was not widely accepted by the medical community, Marr said, likely because there weren’t many medical doctors who signed it. There are only a few experts in the world who study both viruses and air.

But consensus continued to slowly build, and scientific evidence for COVID-19 airborne transmission has only grown. Following a National Academy of Sciences workshop in August 2020, Marr, along with Kim Prather and Jimenez, published an article in Science saying that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne. Afterward, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started changing its tune about the possibility of airborne transmission, Marr said.

“The consensus of COVID aerosol transmission comes out in a very sad manner, with more and more people dying. This is an unfortunate, natural experiment with our life.”

It was only in the spring of 2021 that airborne transmission of coronavirus became more widely accepted when three major medical journals—the Lancet, the BMJ, and the Journal of the American Medical Association—published articles about its importance and the accumulating evidence.

When asked for comment, a spokesperson for WHO wrote in an email in late April 2022 that “the terms used to describe transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have differed across scientific disciplines over the course of the pandemic. WHO has been communicating about the risk of all modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 including aerosols since the early stages of the pandemic. Our scientific understanding of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern with increased transmissibility and greater binding affinity to the host entry receptor, ACE2, highlights the need to reiterate the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including airborne transmission at both short- and long-ranges, depending on the settings.”

“The consensus of COVID aerosol transmission comes out in a very sad manner, with more and more people dying,” Li said. “This is an unfortunate, natural experiment with our life.”

Jimenez became glued to Twitter starting in March 2020. There, he shared information, built a community of scientists, and debated skeptics. “I probably spent a third of my working time on that,” Jimenez said. By the time he took a break in July 2021, he was “exhausted.” But then the Omicron variant hit, and he returned to high-intensity engagement.

He was also able to make the latest COVID-19 information more accessible, tweeting in both English and Spanish, a language that had fewer experts available to communicate crucial information.

“In some respects, it seems that the public got to this answer quicker than parts of the infection control community,” said William Nazaroff, an air quality engineer at the University of California, Berkeley and former editor in chief of Indoor Air. “It wasn’t that hard to persuade people that this really is airborne. You could use a mask, stay away from overly crowded, poorly ventilated conditions, and the public got that faster than some parts of the scientific community.”

Overturning Public Health Dogma

Part of the reason it was so hard and took so long for COVID-19 to be accepted as airborne by the medical community was a “default assumption” that diseases generally did not travel through the air, Marr said.

“It’s in textbooks that these types of diseases are spread by large droplets that spray onto someone’s eyes, nostrils, or lips, and it was just kind of accepted…without thinking about the mechanisms or the fundamental science behind that,” said Marr.

This long-standing dogma is a problem of history, Jimenez said—ancient history. The Greek physician Hippocrates believed that dirty air—miasma—was the root of illness, a view that persisted for more than 2 millennia. In 1910, influential epidemiologist Charles Chapin, with the aid of germ theory, popularized the idea that infection came from contact or droplet transmission. Since then, droplet transmission has become the dominant view.

Before the pandemic, only a handful of respiratory illnesses—tuberculosis, measles, and chicken pox—were accepted as having airborne transmission.

“There was so much resistance to the idea that flus and colds even are airborne,” said Marr, who coauthored a review of other respiratory viruses that could be transmitted through the air and whose research focused on flu transmission before the pandemic. But in addition to rethinking COVID-19 transmission, “I think that’s turning now, too, maybe.”

“We’ve had a bit of a pendulum swing,” agreed Nazaroff.

“The state of understanding and what we learned through experience with COVID is in some ways surprising,” explained Nazaroff, who has done research on the airborne spread of treatment-resistant tuberculosis. “It almost seems self-evident that a respiratory infection…is emitted from somebody who is infectious and then inhaled by a susceptible person as the primary mode of transmission.”

Every time we talk, cough, sneeze, or breathe, we emit particles of respiratory secretions and saliva in a wide range of sizes, from less than a micrometer to more than 100 micrometers in diameter. If there are pathogens in our respiratory system, they could hitch a ride on these particles and be transmitted.

Larger particles, responding readily to gravity, fall quickly to the ground close to the source, within about 2 meters. Smaller particles (aerosols) can remain aloft for minutes to hours, buoyed by air currents, before eventually falling to the ground if the air remains motionless. These aerosols are responsible for airborne transmission and can occur at short range (within 2 meters), where they are most easily transmitted because of higher concentrations of pathogen-containing particles; at long ranges (within a shared room); or even at longer ranges (even in different buildings).

It has been difficult to dislodge public health conceptions of which respiratory particles could be aerosolized. Medical textbooks, for example, considered anything larger than 5 micrometers to be a droplet that falls to the ground quickly, Marr said. But that number was the result of a 60-year-old scientific misunderstanding that, like a virus, propagated until it was established as medical dogma. The research evidence shows that much larger particles (50–100 micrometers) can remain airborne, particularly if there are ambient air currents, and can be carried more than 2 meters. Though there is no definitive cutoff for how large a particle needs to be to be considered a droplet, the threshold is closer to 100 micrometers, and many factors (such as how quickly it was expelled and the speed, temperature, and humidity of the surrounding airflow) can affect its ability to remain suspended.

Health officials also may have been reluctant to declare COVID-19 as airborne because it would shift responsibility from the individual.

Another hurdle was that the public health community had “a different way of gaining an understanding of a complex process,” Nazaroff said. For them, the gold standard is a randomized controlled trial that compares randomly assigned participants receiving an intervention to another group without it, “whereas from a physical science perspective, if I can show A goes to B goes to C goes to D goes to E goes to F—then I can connect A and F and I’m persuaded.”

Approaches from public health and different research disciplines have value, scientists said. “I hope the pandemic has brought more attention to this and to the importance of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary collaborations to understand this,” said Marr.

Health officials also may have been reluctant to declare COVID-19 as airborne because it would shift responsibility from the individual, Morawska said. If COVID-19 were transmitted only through droplets or close contact, health was in the realm of individual responsibility: If you got sick, it was because you did not get vaccinated, wash your hands properly, or wear a mask. But if the virus could linger and spread in the air we all breathe, then the government and public health agencies needed to do something more systematic and costly.

“This is one of the biggest errors in the history of public health. They don’t want to admit it.”

Finally, in December 2021, without announcement or fanfare, WHO quietly changed its website guidelines to acknowledge that COVID-19 could be spread by airborne transmission, marking the first time the public health organization described the coronavirus as “airborne” and a reversal of its firm declaration to the contrary at the start of pandemic.

“Science is a complex, messy business at the frontier,” Nazaroff said. “It’s a human endeavor, so there are people’s egos and ambitions at stake. In a way it’s too bad, but it’s also not surprising. We’re all human actors as scientists, and we bring our strengths and our weaknesses to the enterprise.”

Jimenez gave a different perspective. “This is one of the biggest errors in the history of public health. They don’t want to admit it.”

Indoor Air Quality Is Essential

The pandemic has brought into sharp focus the importance of the air indoors, where most of us spend most of our lives. Indoor air quality problems were all around us before the pandemic and will linger long after if we do not do anything about them.

“When you look at how many contaminants are in the average house in the U.S. and Europe, it’s comparable to Mexico City outdoors on a really bad day,” said Jimenez.

Close to 4 million people are estimated to die prematurely each year because of the health effects of indoor air pollution. Poor air quality indoors is linked to a litany of health issues, including allergies, asthma, lung diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. It is also linked to absenteeism and poorer cognitive performance.

Our indoor air is not just a reflection of outdoor air getting in. Although pollution from the great outdoors can enter buildings, most of the pollutants arise from within. We may regularly produce combustion by-products like carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and smoke from our heating or cooking sources. In addition, personal care and cleaning products release all sorts of organic compounds; some building and furniture materials release formaldehyde.

There are natural pollutants as well, such as radon (a carcinogen), mold, pet dander, and dust. And as COVID-19 has taught us, aerosols in the air can also carry infectious agents.

Climate change, as usual, may make things worse. Worse and longer allergy seasons and worsening wildfires increase the amount of pollen, smoke, and soot making their way indoors. Carbon dioxide, which we release with every exhalation, accumulates indoors at levels found to be harmful to cognition.

Four principles for achieving good indoor air quality: Minimize indoor emissions. Keep it dry. Ventilate well. Protect against outdoor pollution.

Fortunately, we already have the know-how to dramatically improve indoor air quality.

Technological advances like more sensitive tests to detect virus loads in respiratory fluid allowed aerosol scientists to make measurements they couldn’t do routinely just 2 decades ago, Nazaroff said. Having said that, “I don’t think there’s any new, amazing technology that’s just gonna zap the pathogens out,” said Marr. “I think we can get a huge amount of benefit by better implementing the basic things we know about ventilation and filtration.”

Improving ventilation in a building can be as simple as opening a window, which increases airflow and dilutes any virus or pollutants. Air filters and air cleaners can be effective at reducing the amount of contaminant in the air.

For pathogens, including coronavirus, ultraviolet (UV) light treatment is an effective disinfectant, Morawska said. “There’s a lot of discussion about this aspect now because this technology has been known for a long time, for over 80 years. And it’s been used effectively in many places, particularly in health care.”

In an editorial for Indoor Air, Nazaroff articulated four principles expressed in 12 words for achieving good indoor air: Minimize indoor emissions. Keep it dry. Ventilate well. Protect against outdoor pollution.

“What’s standing in the way is a greater appreciation of the importance of clean air, and then the second is money, of course,” Marr said.

Building a Cleaner Future for Indoor Air

COVID-19 might give us the momentum needed to make long-term systemic changes and investments for improving our indoor air. “A big possibility, too early to say, is…that the experience with COVID will raise the profile of indoor air quality problems more generally,” said Nazaroff.

“When there’s not a pandemic, we still have indoor air quality problems, we still have toxic chemicals in our environment, we still have combustion sources. We still have formaldehyde, we still have flu,” said Miller. “There are all of these indoor air quality problems that we’ve been trying to solve for decades, that now we have the obvious attention of most of the public and the scientific community to say, ‘Wow, I can’t believe we’ve been overlooking indoor air.’”

“It’s not SARS-CoV-2 which is on my mind because this will pass,” Morawska said. “It is the future of infection transmission.… That’s why the time is now to put the regulations in place while we are still going through this. That’s why I and all the other scientists have put in all the work we can do towards this.”

In an editorial published in Science in May 2021, Morawska, along with many other experts, proposed a “paradigm shift” in how we combat indoor respiratory infection with building engineering solutions and public health policies.

Jimenez noted that the editorial echoed a call for better ventilation made in 1945 by William Wells, a pioneer of aerosol transmission. “Now, in 2021…well, we said the same thing, almost the same words: Ventilation has been neglected.”

“What I’m stressing as much as possible now is that countries need national indoor air quality standards.”

The design of future buildings should support different ventilation strategies, Morawska said. “Future designs would take into account human health from all aspects of indoor air quality and energy as well.”

And we need more than just updated building codes, which establish minimum requirements, Miller said. “What happens with building codes as minimum is everyone just builds to the minimum. So the building is sort of minimally crappy.”

Instead, updated environmental legislation is needed, like what we already have for water and outdoor air quality to protect public health by setting health-based standards requiring the “best available control technology” to reach them, Miller said.

“What I’m stressing as much as possible now is that countries need national indoor air quality standards,” Morawska said.

Having standards means enforcing those standards, which in turn means making measurements, which is more complex and costly for indoor air than outdoor air, said Morawska. “It’s much more complex, but not impossible.”

Fortunately, many modern buildings are already equipped with sensors to detect carbon dioxide levels, which can be used as a proxy for ventilation and human-emitted pollutants. Though these sensors are used for HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning) systems, such technologies could be implemented for measuring air quality.

In the United States, there is no government entity at either the state or federal level that is clearly responsible for the air quality of our indoor spaces, Nazaroff said. “Outdoor air is undoubtedly a shared resource. We all contribute to its pollution. But no one of us can fix it. Our indoor air has a more complex and nuanced balance between who’s responsible for it.”

Researchers are cautiously optimistic.

“I worry that people have a short attention span, but it feels like we’re potentially on the cusp of an indoor air revolution.”

“The greatest success story in history for indoor air pollution has been the shift in smoking behavior,” Nazaroff said. Through a multifaceted approach of new rules, changes in social behavior, increased health awareness, and a generational shift, he said, “we’re now in a very different place than we were 30 years ago. And that gives me hope.”

Places like Finland, Sweden, South Korea, and Taiwan already have legislation for indoor air quality or ventilation. And the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge highlights recommendations and resources for improving ventilation and indoor air quality, as well as serving as a call to action for reducing risks related to airborne contaminants indoors.

“This is probably the most significant step which I’ve seen so far, and this hopefully will give other countries direction,” Morawska said.

Pollutants and infectious diseases will remain a lingering threat in our indoor air long after the current pandemic peters out. But COVID-19 may have changed how we see, cherish, and protect the air we breathe.

“I worry that people have a short attention span, but it feels like we’re potentially on the cusp of an indoor air revolution,” Marr said.

Is your NJ community overburdened with pollution? Here's how to find out,"Is your NJ community overburdened with pollution? Here's how to find out

Show Caption Hide Caption How to find pollution in your neighborhood using NJ's new mapping tool The NJDEP's new mapping tool has information on pollution down to the neighborhood level in overburdened communities. Scott Fallon, NorthJersey.com

A new online mapping tool introduced Monday allows New Jerseyans who live in neighborhoods with low-income households or a sizable minority population to see how pollution — from smog levels to drinking water violations — affects their communities.

The mapping tool is part of the state's rollout of environmental justice rules that require greater scrutiny of proposals to build a factory, power plant or other facilities in neighborhoods that have historically been overburdened with pollution.

The state Department of Environmental Protection has detailed information on pollution in 3,184 census blocks in 310 municipalities that are considered overburdened, in all 21 counties.

""When you have information, then you're able to make informed decisions about your quality of life, your community, your neighborhood,"" said Kandyce Perry, director of the DEP’s Office of Environmental Justice. ""Without that information, how could you weigh in?""

The mapping tool allows members of the public to enter an address to see if they are in an overburdened neighborhood. From there, they can get pollution and public health information via a tab called ""Stressor Summary."" There are 26 categories of ""stressors"" on a community, ranging from lead exposure and soot levels in the air to contaminated sites and sewage overflows.

Other maps on the website show major polluting facilities across the state, including incinerators, scrap metal facilities, power plants, landfills and garbage transfer stations. The tool can be found at https://bit.ly/3xoVpyw.

The new rules, which are being published Monday in the state register, are a hallmark of Gov. Phil Murphy's environmental agenda and would affect residents in more than half of the state's municipalities.

Business groups have said the rules may halt economic development in places where it's most needed. Supporters say it will help residents living in communities that have borne a greater level of pollution, and the public health risks and lowered life expectancy that go along with it.

""It's going to feel too big, too fast, too soon for some,"" DEP Commissioner Shawn LaTourette said at a briefing on the rules last week, referring to the business community. ""And it's going to feel too little, too slow, too late for others.""

The rules allow the DEP to deny a permit if it finds that the cumulative environmental or public health impact of a project would be higher in the overburdened community rather than other non-burdened New Jersey communities.

The economic impact of a new facility will not be considered when making a determination. But the rules allow the DEP latitude in permitting when it comes to projects that ""serve a compelling public interest,"" such as addressing an essential environmental, health or safety need in a community.

""This rule will be debated, contested and refined in the months and years to come,"" LaTourette said.

The criteria used to classify a community as overburdened cuts a wide swath in New Jersey and results in some surprising designations. Parts of some of the richest towns in New Jersey are on the list, including Alpine, Saddle River, Millburn, Rumson and Colts Neck.

That's because even in those towns, some census blocks meet the definition of overburdened as drafted by lawmakers — at least 35% of households in the census block are low-income, or at least 40% of residents identify as minority, or at least 40% of households have limited English proficiency.

""Overburdened block groups exist in all parts of the state, north, south, urban, rural, suburban and, yeah, in places where the municipality's income level is above the poverty line,"" Perry said.

On Monday, a group of environmentalists who have lived in overburdened communities called the publishing of the new draft rules a ""critically important milestone"" and urged they be adopted swiftly.

""For far too long some of the worst actors have lied or bought their way into the good graces of a few key people and claimed that their 'back room' deals were community engagement,"" said Melissa Miles, executive director of the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance ""Even now some communities expect polluting industries to operate in obscurity and without their input. That all ends with the implementation of the EJ Law.""

Power plant proposal

Despite being published Monday in the New Jersey Register, the rules are still only proposed and have to go through a public comment period. They are not expected to be adopted until the end of the year at the earliest.

That means they don't apply to facility proposals already being evaluated by the DEP, including a controversial plan by the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission to build a gas-fired power plant in Newark. It is considered one of the biggest tests for the Murphy administration's rhetoric on environmental justice.

At a briefing last week, LaTourette confirmed that the rules wouldn't apply to the power plant proposal, but said an administrative order he issued would subject the plan to the spirit of the rules. Opponents say that it's not nearly as strict a review.

The proposal has generated significant opposition from community and environmental groups, which say it goes against everything the concept of environmental justice stands for. If built, it will be located in and near low-income and minority communities that are already getting significant air pollution from Port Newark, a nearby incinerator, other power plants and some of the busiest truck traffic in the U.S.

The commission says the power plant would be used only for emergencies and is needed in case a catastrophic weather event knocks out power, as was the case when Superstorm Sandy hit the plant in 2012, causing 840 million gallons of raw sewage to pour into Newark Bay and surrounding waterways.

The commission recently said it would add more renewable energy sources elsewhere to help offset the emissions.

The burden of Minnesota’s air pollution is unequal,"In February, the Minnesota Department of Health released the results of a pioneering study that examined chemical exposure from air pollutants in preschool-age children. The report received scant attention, despite the fact that the results were quite shocking, and this was the first comprehensive study of its kind that focused on pre-K children in Minnesota.

For the study, researchers measured the levels of 21 metals, pesticides and air pollution chemicals in urine samples from children who live in north Minneapolis and in Becker, Todd and Wadena counties. They found that urine from children who live in the more urban setting contained higher levels of several air pollutants that belong to a larger class of chemicals known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

PAHs are common air pollution chemicals created during combustion from engines, grills and even burning incense and candles. What’s more, when measuring the atmospheric concentrations of PAHs in these locations, the researchers found that air pollutant levels for each chemical were at least 10 times higher in urban areas.

Although more research is needed to definitively link the elevated concentrations of PAHs in the children’s urine to pollution from vehicles and industry (which are generally much higher in urban settings), the differences between the sampled areas are stark and worth highlighting.

Based on the report’s socioeconomic data, minority and low-income residents tend to be more affected by elevated air pollutants. The urban area had a significantly higher percentage of racial and ethnic minority participants (87%) than the rural counties (7%). There was also a higher likelihood for participants in north Minneapolis to be living in a low-income household, which means they have fewer resources to push back against polluters in their communities and are more vulnerable to environmental degradation.

These findings cannot be taken lightly. The effects of air pollution on human health are dangerous, extensive and even lethal. The World Health Organization labels air pollution as the cause of death for millions each year. Effects on human health can range from short-term respiratory discomfort to long-term organ damage, cancer and heart disease.

For children, whose immune systems tend to be weaker, exposure can lead to impaired neurological development, more incidents of asthma and respiratory distress, and long term damage to the lungs.

For substantial improvements to occur, policy change is necessary. Emissions produced by industrial facilities are one of the greatest contributors to the disparity in air pollutant concentration, both within Minnesota and around the globe.

To release these toxic chemicals, companies are required to obtain air pollution permits from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency that grant them the right to pollute a certain amount per year. Historically, these permits have been provided without regard to the effects on local communities.

Rep. Fue Lee, DFL-St. Paul, has sought to change this by sponsoring legislation that calls for the MPCA to incorporate demographic analysis, and identify areas of the state that have been disproportionately affected by air pollutants. The measure would require the MPCA to consider the cumulative effects of historical pollution and to deny permit requests based on whether a community has had a legacy of being disproportionately affected by air pollution. This could be a game-changer for communities of color and lower-income communities in north Minneapolis and elsewhere.

Lee’s proposal has been added as an amendment to a larger omnibus bill, SF4062. This is a critical time to show support for it, as state legislators are currently deliberating the bill’s amendments in a conference committee.

It is imperative that we come together to protect vulnerable communities that often don’t have a voice, and this change is a great place to start. With this proposed legislation, the necessary work of undoing the damage caused by decades of unjust environmental policy and practice can finally begin.",,[],"['More From Author', 'May', 'Dheera Yalamanchili']"
3 young air pollution activists on why they became campaigners,"99% of people worldwide breathe air above the safe limits suggested by the World Health Organization.

And 1.8 billion people under the age of 15 breathe air that is so polluted it risks their health and development.

These three young activists, from Nigeria, Colombia and the U.S., are working in their communities and countries to help mitigate that harm.

Climate change affects human health in a myriad of ways, but perhaps one of the most immediately harmful is by degrading the air we breathe.

World Health Organization (WHO) data shows that 99% of the global population breathes air that exceeds guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants.

A 2020 survey found at least two-thirds of citizens in Bulgaria, India, Nigeria, Poland and the United Kingdom support stricter regulations to tackle air pollution. In India and Nigeria, more than 90% of those surveyed wanted to see air quality improved in their area.

The Forum asked three young activists to share why they began campaigning on air pollution, and what is next for them.

Air pollution reminds me of how things out of your control can still dramatically shape your future —Alejandro Daly

Air pollution activists share their stories

Alejandro Daly

National Director, El Derecho a No Obedecer, Colombia

“I was born with asthma,” said Daly. “After I arrived in Bogotá it got worse due to air pollution.”

According to the WHO, 1.8 billion people under the age of 15 breathe air that is so polluted it risks their health and development. In Colombia, according to the National Planning Department, a person dies of diseases related to air pollution every 50 minutes.

“Air pollution reminds me of how things out of your control can still dramatically shape your future, drastically diminishing agency and well-being. That is why, as Director of El Derecho a No Obedecer, I have led my organization's efforts to fight air pollution.”

Since 2018, his organization has carried out three national campaigns to advocate for clean air in Colombia, mobilizing more than 5,000 climate activists, academics, and government officials.

“In 2019 we created the first School of Advocacy for Air Quality — ‘New Airs’. In two years, we have trained 130 people representing 25 different municipalities in the country, delivered around 50 low-cost sensors to measure air pollution, and developed methodologies to mobilize young people for air quality,” said Daly.

His goal, he explained, is to take what he and his organization have learned in Colombia and create a Latin American Network for Clean Air. Daly and his team want to promote awareness across the continent of the scourge of air pollution and encourage the empowerment and collaboration required for the construction of effective public policies to tackle it.

“I strongly believe in the need to change the global narrative around the climate crisis,” he said.

“To fight air pollution, we need to first strengthen civil society organizations' capacities, and then promote the creation of strong national and international coalitions. By doing this, we will create an inclusive global climate agenda that includes actions for the right to health and a healthy environment.”

Sophia Kianni

Founder and Executive Director, Climate Cardinals, US

“Growing up, I witnessed the impacts of oil and gas pollution firsthand in my parents’ home country of Iran, where thousands of people are being hospitalized a day because of worsening air quality,” said Kianni.

“In Washington, D.C., where I’m from, new studies have found that air pollution poses inequitable health risks. There, neighborhoods with higher proportions of people of color and lower income and education levels are more susceptible to the worst impacts of climate change.”

Kianni recently moved to California, where air pollution is a major problem, to attend Stanford University.

“As someone with a family history of asthma, I’m very concerned about ensuring that my generation and future generations will have access to clean, livable air,” she said.

To further her air pollution advocacy, Kianni joined the American Lung Association as their first climate activist advisor. There she lobbied the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Biden Administration to strengthen their methane emission rules and to educate the American public about the dangers of air pollution to public health.

“Through the Stand Up For Clean Air initiative, we have launched a public information campaign to talk about the fact that more than 40% of Americans are living with unhealthy air, unhealthy levels of ozone or particulate pollution,” said Kianni, adding: “People of color are over three times more likely to be breathing the most polluted air than white people.”

Kianni said: “In the future, I hope to receive funding to distribute grants to youth-led grassroots organizations and non-profits working on climate education and air pollution campaigning.”

Olumide Idowu

Co-Founder, International Climate Change Development Initiative, Nigeria

“The major reason for being an activist is I find myself in a situation where I see families and children suffering from a polluted environment, and new research being published about the link between air pollution and respiratory health,” said Idowu, who started campaigning against air pollution in 2013.

“The world is getting hotter and more crowded in my country, Nigeria, where our population is growing every day, and will soon exceed 250 million,” he said. “Such an environment needs a lot of support and precautions against air pollution. Air pollution is closely linked to climate change, and the health effects of air pollution are serious in Lagos State, where I live.”

Idowu is currently working on a youth campaign called #WhatHasChanged, which aims to influence the digital conversation by asking governments what they have done to build a healthier, more sustainable future.

He is also working with government agencies to monitor air quality treatments, an initiative sponsored by the World Bank that aims to build a bank of data on pollution in Nigeria, as well as fund a series of workshops that will raise awareness about air pollution.",,[],"['Roderick Weller', 'Written By', 'Olivier M.

How the COVID-19 virus affects someone may be exacerbated by the air they breathe. Researchers found a link between exposure to airborne particulate matter, including fine particles known as PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and heightened risk of serious coronavirus complications. Advertisement

""Our research demonstrated that one-year average exposure to PM2.5 translated to a 20-30% increase in the risk of hospitalization, intensive respiratory support and ICU admissions from COVID-19. Exposure to NO2 for one month carried an increased risk of 12-18%,"" said study co-author Zhanghua Chen, assistant professor of population and public health sciences at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine.

""We also saw that long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19,"" she said in a university news release.

USC researchers collaborated with Kaiser Permanente Southern California for the study, reviewing data from more than 74,000 COVID-19 patients diagnosed between March and August 2020. The investigators were able to predict exposure history for specific pollutants by using participants' residential address history.

PM2.5 and NO2 are produced by ground and air traffic, industrial burning and other sources.

""Ecological analyses are subject to a lot of biases, and it wasn't clear whether the findings could be applied beyond the community level,"" Chen said.

""In our population cohort study, we were able to leverage the sophistication of EMR [electronic medical records] to create a well-defined classification of the severity of COVID-19 outcomes tied to air pollution exposure at the individual level,"" she said.

Kaiser Permanente records included background information that allowed researchers to adjust for other factors, including race, social standing and other health conditions.

The researchers now plan to examine intervention approaches to reduce individual levels of PM2.5 exposure, such as using air purifiers.

RELATED Experts point to air pollutants posing significant risks to health

The findings were published recently in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

""Our study demonstrates that breathing clean air may reduce the severity of the infection,"" said co-author Dr. Frank Gilliland, a professor of population and public health sciences.

""When someone is infected, reducing their exposure to air pollutants maybe beneficial, as it may decrease the risk for poor outcomes and also has many other health benefits,"" he said in the release.

Some Types of Air Pollution Are Even Worse for Your Health,"By By Robert Preidt HealthDay Reporter, HealthDay Reporter

(HealthDay)

MONDAY, May 30, 2022 (HealthDay News) -- Exposure to high levels of particle air pollution can increase your risk of death from stroke, and the risk is highest with the smallest-sized particles that can get deep into the lungs, researchers say.

""Air pollution has been previously linked to a greater risk of stroke, and stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide,"" said study author Hualiang Lin of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China.

""What is lesser known is how the different sizes of particulate matter affect that risk. Our research found that the size of air pollution particles may affect a person's risk of dying from stroke,"" Lin said in a Neurology news release. The findings were published online in the journal on May 25.

The study looked at the threat posed by three sizes of air pollution particulate matter, which consists of solids or liquids floating in the air.

Submicron particulate matter (PM1) is less than 1 micron in diameter. It includes soot and smog. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is less than 2.5 microns in diameter and includes fly ash from coal combustion. Respirable particulate matter (PM10), which includes cement dust, is less than 10 microns in diameter.

""Our study includes measurements of PM1, which may be small enough to be inhaled deeply into lungs, pass through lung tissue and circulate in the bloodstream,"" Lin said.

""Obtaining a deeper understanding of the risk factors of all particulate matter sizes and the magnitude of their possible effects may help reduce the number of deaths and improve the outcomes for people with stroke,"" he added.

The researchers examined data on more than 3.1 million hospitalizations in China for ischemic stroke caused by a blood clot and hemorrhagic stroke caused by bleeding in the brain. The average age of the patients was 67, and 1% died of stroke while hospitalized.

The researchers determined the patients' average exposure to air pollution in the seven days before they were hospitalized for stroke as well as their average daily exposure over the previous year.

After adjusting for factors such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, diabetes and high blood pressure, the study authors concluded that each 10 micrograms per cubic centimeter of air (μg/m3) increase in annual average exposure to particulate matter was associated with an increased risk of dying of stroke while hospitalized, with a 24% greater risk for exposure to PM1, a 11% greater risk for exposure to PM2.5, and a 9% greater risk for exposure to PM10.

Seven-day average exposure to particulate matter included a 6% higher risk with exposure to PM1, a 4% increased risk with exposure to PM2.5, and a 3% increased risk with exposure to PM10.

Patients with ischemic stroke had a higher risk of death than those with hemorrhagic stroke, and those with ischemic stroke and exposure to the smallest air pollution particles (PM1) had the highest risk.

However, the researchers found that reducing exposure to PM10 would do the most to reduce stroke deaths, by 10% for short-term exposure and 21% for long-term exposure.

The findings do not prove that air pollution causes stroke deaths, they only show an association, Lin noted.

Govt directs local bodies to act against noise pollution- The New Indian Express,"By Express News Service

NEW DELHI: Aiming to effectively control and curb noise pollution in Delhi, the government proposed to empower officials of civic bodies to take action against violators, according to officials. The Delhi Environment Department has also submitted a proposal to the Union Environment Ministry to designate SHOs as an authority to prosecute violators under noise pollution rules.

Under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, deputy commissioners, subdivisional magistrates, assistant commissioners of police (traffic), subdivisional police officers — including of railways and airports — and member secretary and chairman of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee have been designated to take action against violators.

In Delhi, the local and civic bodies — MCD, NDMC and Delhi Cantonment Board — are not empowered to initiate legal action under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules. The only option available to them is to report the violation to the designated authorities.

A committee set up by the National Green Tribunal to monitor compliance of the noise rules felt that noise pollution cannot be effectively controlled and curbed in Delhi without active participation of local bodies.",,[],[]
‘Real’ atmospheric samples covering pollution particles analysed using neutrons for the first time,"A new approach of studying the behaviour of surface films covering particles taken directly from the atmosphere has been developed by scientists.

These new insights are important for how scientists understand and model pollution. Previously, the only way comparable data could be collected has been through the use of ‘proxies’ – chemical compounds produced in the lab and designed to behave like different air pollution particles.

The technique offers a fresh perspective on pollutants covering particles and highlights key differences between the way pollutants behave and break down in ‘real’ atmospheric conditions and the way they behave in the laboratory.

Our work clearly demonstrates that to understand coating of atmospheric aerosols we must use real samples extracted from the atmosphere rather than only pure compounds from a chemist’s shelf. Professor Martin King, Royal Holloway, University of London

In a new study, published in Environmental Science: Atmospheres, scientists have used neutron reflection to examine pollutants taken from three different environments: urban, Antarctic, and wood burning materials. They were able to measure how these materials react with the hydroxyl radical, OH – one of the most reactive molecules found in the atmosphere.

Most importantly, the team demonstrated key differences between the ways the real atmospheric materials behaved, compared to the standard laboratory materials.

“The compounds we generally study in the laboratory to mimic pollution particles and examine their behaviour are much better constrained than those you would find in real atmospheric conditions,” explains Dr Christian Pfrang, at the University of Birmingham. ""This makes it easier to study them and possible to understand the detailed mechanisms at work, so remains an important approach to enhance our understanding of key atmospheric processes. However, this work should be complemented by studies of real samples collected from a diverse set of locations.”

The process for collecting and testing ‘real’ samples has been carefully designed by the researchers. The material is collected in situ on quartz filters which allows the particles to attach and form a film specific to distinct environments across the globe. This product is then rinsed into a solution, transported to a neutron facility, where the solution is evaporated to reveal the film.

Inside the neutron facility, neutrons are reflected from the film to follow its reaction with the OH radicals to ultimately establish how rapidly these films would break down on atmospheric particles.

Professor Martin King from Royal Holloway’s Department of Earth Sciences, said: “Our work clearly demonstrates that to understand coating of atmospheric aerosols we must use real samples extracted from the atmosphere rather than only pure compounds from a chemist’s shelf as simulants because their behaviour is different and not representative.”",,[],[]
"Surat Congress leaders, villagers complain about water pollution by textile mills","Congress leaders along with residents of Parab village in Surat have complained to district collector Ayush Oak and Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) officials about untreated waste being discharged from textile mills into the Kadodara creek in Kamrej.

Parab village in Kamrej taluka of the district, which has a population of 2,000 people, has witnessed such untreated waste discharge into the creek for a long time, and the villagers have been knocking on the door of every government department seeking action.

Darshan Naik, former leader of the Opposition in the Surat district panchayat, led the delegation that met the officials. “Textile factories in Parab village have been discharging untreated waste into the creek on for a long time. We have complained about this to the GPCB, district collector, and labour department officials. The industrial units have violated pollution norms,” he said.

A resident, Paresh Desai (60), told The Indian Express, “There are over four dyeing and printing mills and over hundreds of water jet factories in the industrial area near the village. These factories discharge untreated liquid waste through drainage lines directly to the Kadodara creek. The creek water finally reaches the Mindola river. We have complained about this to the factories but they have not taken any steps. We have complained about this to the GPCB office in Surat multiple times but no actions have been taken. When GPCB officials visit for inspection, the factories get prior information and remain shut. A few others remain operational but discharge normal water into the creek. We have also shared this information with GPCB officials.”

Jigna Oza, Surat regional officer of the GPCB, said, “We will secretly send teams to the spot on the basis of the information we have got.

Researcher discusses climate change and air pollution impacts on children’s health,"Horror stories of children trapped in hot cars make headlines, but air pollution and impacts from a changing climate are more constant threats. Children are at higher risk for health changes due to these impacts for a range of reasons, including the way their bodies metabolize toxins, need more air on a per pound basis, and regulate temperature differently than adults. More than 90% of children under 15 regularly breathe air so polluted it puts their health and development at serious risk, while vector-borne diseases and water scarcity – scourges exacerbated by global warming – affect more than one in four children and more than one in three, respectively.

Kari Nadeau, director of Stanford’s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy & Asthma Research, studies air pollution’s effects on the heart, lungs, and immune system. Her work has confirmed that early exposure to dirty air alters genes in a way that could lead to serious ailments in adulthood, changes the immune system over time, and affects learning, among other findings. Nadeau and Frederica Perera of the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health co-authored a review paper June 16 in the New England Journal of Medicine that outlines pollution and climate change threats to children’s health and calls for better understanding and intervention from health professionals.

Here, Nadeau discusses environmental risk to children’s health and what caregivers and health workers can do to lessen them.

What might the average person be surprised to learn about how air pollution or climate change affects children’s health?

While there has been significant progress in reducing poverty-related environmental risks in recent decades, industrialization-related pollution has steadily increased and every single child in the world is expected to suffer from at least one climate change-related event in the next 10 years – that’s something most people might be shocked to learn. Similarly, I think it’s particularly striking that about a quarter of deaths among children under 5 globally could be prevented by addressing environmental risks.

What can parents and other caregivers do to minimize their children’s exposure to air pollution and climate change impacts?

There are a range of personal and family changes people can make. For example, parents that use electric cars for their family can decrease the likelihood of their child getting asthma by 30%. If a family can reduce eating meat just by one day a week, that can help protect the planet and improve the health of their children. Also, buying a filter like MERV 13 or higher for your home can reduce indoor air pollution. Using electric appliances instead of gas can improve the air that your family breathes by 50%.

What should parents and other caregivers in wildfire-prone areas know about the risk of smoke to children?

There is no safe distance from wildfire smoke. Children need to be inside when wildfire smoke pushes the air quality index, or AQI, above 50, especially those with asthma, because their lungs are developing and the smoke can be irreversibly harmful to them. Children should wear well-fitted N95 masks outside during days of wildfire smoke. Being outside in heavy wildfire smoke is similar to smoking cigarettes. In fact, even with an AQI as low as 22, breathing outdoor air for 8 hours is like smoking one cigarette in terms of smoke inhalation and exposure to a range of chemicals. That may be hard to believe, but it’s a real and compelling reason to switch to clean, renewable energy sources.

How can air pollution and climate change affect children’s mental health and/or cognitive abilities?

Recent epidemiologic research indicates that air pollution is a risk factor for mental health conditions in children and adolescents. For example, lifetime exposure to traffic-related air pollution can lead to depression and anxiety symptoms. Of particular concern are the cumulative impacts on mental health of air pollution and climate change. Adverse experiences in childhood, such as disasters and displacement, not only raise the short-term risk for mental disorders but also confer a lasting vulnerability to anxiety, depression, and mood disorders in adulthood.

What are some of the ways in which children in disadvantaged communities suffer a higher burden from these impacts?

Children of color are up to 10 times more likely to be exposed to toxins, pollution, and climate change than other children. In the U.S., rates of childhood asthma are twice as high among Black children as white children likely because of higher concentrations of particulate air pollution in Black communities. These and other environmental impacts, combined with poverty-related stress, injustice, and lack of access to health care, add up over a lifetime. They lead to worsened health effects and shortened lifespans.

How should pediatricians and other health professionals think about these issues, and how can we better train them in this regard?

We need to incorporate children’s environmental health into primary care and essential public health. For example, when a family visits the pediatrician for a well-child visit and for preventive vaccinations, the pediatrician can speak proactively about the importance of breathing clean air, avoiding wildfire smoke. The pediatrician can ask about access to child-fitting N95 masks and home air filters. We can engage community health workers and networks to help build awareness on children’s environmental health, local environmental assessments, and through their participation in community-led pollution and emission reduction measures, among other initiatives.

Lisa Patel, a clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford, was instrumental in getting the American Board of Pediatrics to incorporate questions about climate change and health into the certifying exam for physicians. Barbary Erny, an adjunct clinical associate professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine, and Michele Barry, director of Stanford’s Center for Innovation in Global Health, have created lessons for medical students and trainees in climate change and health. These lessons are shared throughout the country and world.

Paper tiger? Punjab Pollution Control Board not able to recover environmental fines imposed in last 2 years,"Punjab government’s move is a mockery of the law, at a time when environmental pollution is becoming deadly and dangerous

The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) imposed fines worth Rs 130 crore on urban municipal bodies during the last two years for violating several environmental laws. But it managed to recover just Rs 17 crore, according to a report.

This is yet another instance of how pollution control boards impose environmental fines but prove to be toothless in recovering them.

The report has been prepared by Justice Jasbir Singh’s committee that was set up to oversee the implementation of the National Green Tribunal (NGT)’s orders on waste management.

Read DTE Investigation: CPCB failed to recover fines from Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Reliance, Adani in last 30 years

The report stated that the PPCB had imposed an environmental fine of Rs 17.01 crore on various municipal bodies of Punjab for non-compliance of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, between July 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021.

The PPCB had also imposed a fine of Rs 20.35 crore for non-compliance of rules between April 1, 2021 and February 28, 2022.

“An environmental penalty of Rs 93.22 crore was imposed on municipal bodies in Punjab between July 1, 2020 and February 28, 2022, for non-adoption of site remediation of drains and non-installation of sewage treatment plants,” the report added.

It noted that the state government had deposited an environmental penalty of Rs 17 crore with the PPCB only in case of non-compliance of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. “This is a very small amount of the environmental penalty to be paid by the state government,” the report said.

The committee of Justice Jasbir Singh, in its report submitted to the NGT on the case of seven people who died in a garbage dump in Ludhiana, had recommended that the state government deposit fines over Rs 100 crore to the Punjab Pollution Control Board.

Environmental fines are used for immediate relief and long-term relief under the polluter-pays principal.

The Punjab government is mocking environmental fines through its actions at a time when environmental pollution is becoming deadly and dangerous.

Lessons have not been learned even after two people died at Delhi’s Ghazipur landfill site in 2017. After this, in 2022, seven people of the same family were burnt to death in a garbage dump in Tajpur, Ludhiana and a middle-aged woman died after burning in plastic waste in Manesar, Haryana.

"Even moderate air pollution in Allegheny County raises ER visits for kids with asthma, study finds","Even moderate amounts of air pollution increase the number of children going to emergency rooms for asthma in Allegheny County, a new study finds.

The study looked at the Air Quality Index in Pittsburgh from 2010 to 2018. The index was created by the federal EPA to translate air quality data for specific pollutants into a color-coded system.

Study author Franziska Rosser, a pediatric pulmonologist with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center – Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, said even ‘yellow’ days, where the Air Quality Index is ‘moderate’ and within federal air quality standards, caused an uptick in ER visits.

“During our study period, half of the days were in the moderate range here in Pittsburgh,” Rosser said. “Yes, this is below the EPA [guidelines], but if you’re somebody that’s sensitive in those yellow days, there’s a lot of yellow days in Pittsburgh.”

Rosser said the study shows that parents and doctors can use the Air Quality Index, which is displayed on the EPA’s Airnow.gov website, as an early warning system for children with asthma. Green designates a good air quality day, then increasing air pollution levels are yellow, orange, red, purple and maroon.

“It might be that you notice that it’s not in the orange zone (when) your child might start having symptoms, but even in the yellow zone,” Rosser said. “To me, the results demonstrate that there are at least some children who live within the county who could be considered unusually sensitive to air pollution.”

Benefits of the Air Quality Index

Sheryl Magzamen, associate professor of environmental health at Colorado State University, said the paper adds to an already extensive understanding that pollution triggers asthma.

Magzamen, who was not involved with the study, said while most studies focus on obscure monitoring data only available to scientists and experts, this study the much more accessible Air Quality Index.

“You don’t need to be able to access the EPA website. You can just look on your phone and understand what the air quality is for the day,” Magzamen said. “And potentially, if it’s in that moderate or hazardous level or above that, you and your family can take steps to prevent potential exacerbations of chronic diseases.”

Black children most affected

The study, which appears in Annals of the American Thoracic Society, found that Black children and children 6 to 11 were affected the most by increased air pollution levels, and that particle pollution was the pollutant most directly associated with increased ER visits.

Earlier this year, for the first time ever, Allegheny County met federal air quality standards at all of its air pollution monitors. But that designation may be temporary. The EPA may tighten its standards on particulate matter later this year, after its own scientific panel recommended stricter standards.

Belgium leads fight against car pollution with extra particle filter check,"Vehicle inspection in Brussels. Credit: Bruxelles Mobilité

Cars without or with a defective particle filter will no longer be able to pass the technical inspection in Belgium as part of a new measure that is “making the country a forerunner” in the fight against air pollution.

Starting from 1 July this year, car inspections in Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia will carry out a new particle filter test during the technical inspection of the car. If this shows that the car doesn’t have the relevant filter or it is damaged, the car will fail the test.

“There has been talk of particulate filter fraud for a long time, and we are now tackling it,” Flemish Mobility Minister Lydia Peeters said. The measure is mainly aimed at catching fraudsters, people who “deliberately drive around with a defective particulate filter or who deliberately remove their particulate filter, at the technical inspection.”

For the monitoring of fine dust emissions, inspection centres in Belgium will start using a PN meter, which measures the number of dust particles that the particulate filter of a vehicle fails to stop.

With this additional technical control, Belgium is ahead of the other European countries, as the EU-wide directive relies on the opacimeter, a tool that is efficient for checking diesel vehicles without a particulate filter, meaning fraud involving the particulate filter cannot be detected.

Impact of filters on emissions

The widespread use of soot filters in diesel vehicles has helped reduce emissions of particulate matter from road transport in the last decade, however, faulty or poorly functioning particulate filters have a major negative impact on air quality.

“When working correctly, these filters are effective, but when damaged, worn out or even completely removed, the number of particles emitted can soar: vehicles can then emit up to 500 times more particulate matter than with a properly functioning filter,” said Elke Van den Brandt, Brussels Minister for Mobility.

Related News

A measuring result above 1,000,000 fine particles/cm³ means that the filter is broken or missing, which will result in a driving ban, together with the obligation to have the vehicle checked again after it has been repaired.

Justifying measure

Air pollution results thousands of premature deaths per year in Belgium, making it a major health problem. “These consequences, and the health costs associated with them, fully justify the adoption of measures to constantly reduce the main sources of pollution,” Dr Patricia Palacios, from the Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, said.

The state or presence of filters will be checked on all passenger cars and vans with diesel engines of the Euro 5a standard and newer. If a major defect is found, the validity of the inspection certificate will be limited to 15 days, so that the owner of the vehicle can have the defect repaired.

The price for the technical inspection will not change as a result of this change, and the test shouldn’t take too long or harm the engine.

Another study has been launched to examine whether the scope can be extended to include heavy goods vehicles, buses and petrol-driven vehicles.",,[],['The Brussels Times']

* Hayleys Aventura introduces Eco-One: newest weapon in plastic pollution battle

Wed, Jun 15, 2022, 12:40 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

June 15, Colombo: Hayleys Aventura has introduced Eco-One, an innovative product developed in the USA, to help manufacturers mitigate pollution caused by the disposal of plastics, polythene and rubber – one of Sri Lanka’s most pressing environmental challenges.

The organic additive, which is applied during the production process, enhances the biodegradation of plastic and polythene products. This drastically shortens the timespan such products are retained in landfills, from centuries to a few years. Once Eco-One incorporated polymer products are disposed in a microbial rich environment, the additive attracts microorganisms that consume it as a ‘food source’ along with the polymer product’s chemical elements converting it to inert humus (organic soil matter) and biogas energy.

“As a leader in providing innovative industrial solutions and technology, Hayleys Aventura remains committed to advancing the sustainability efforts of Sri Lankan manufacturers including those who seek to take our country to global export markets,” Hayleys Aventura (Pvt) Ltd Managing Director, Wasaba Jayasekera said. “As the engine of growth of our national economy, it’s important that the private sector plays an active role in mitigating pollution and Eco-One provides them with a viable solution to do so.”

Adding just 1% of Eco-One to the plastic compound improves the rate of degradation of the item to 18 months with complete degradation possible within approximately 3 years. This may however change depending on the physical and chemical composition of the product. Customers also have the option of achieving a faster degradation rate by increasing the dose.

The process and residual have been rigorously tested and are certified to have no adverse impact on the soil or the environment, an advantage over alternatives that leave behind fragments and micro-particles. In fact, the remnant nutrient-rich soil can even be used as fertilizer.

Moreover, the process has been supported by third-party studies conducted by local and global test bodies such as Bureau Veritas and Northeast Laboratories. Inc.

Eco-One can be conveniently applied without altering production lines, enabling low-cost integration into existing manufacturing processes. At the recommended level of application, the additive is a superior option for manufacturers and exporters looking to enter global markets, with a production cost impact of 10% – 15%, significantly below the cost of utilising biopolymers which also require special equipment and have limited supply.

Hayleys Aventura is the exclusive representative for Eco-One for SAARC countries, Indonesia and Myanmar. Several major Sri Lankan exporters to US and European markets are already utilising the additive, in producing their packaging.

Hayleys Aventura represents the Industrial Inputs and Energy Sector of Hayleys PLC. The company has established itself as the premier industrial solutions provider in Sri Lanka and consists of five diversified strategic business units.

"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $33 Million Infrastructure Investment to Address Legacy Pollution, Spur Good-Paying Jobs on Public Lands","Date: Wednesday, May 25, 2022

Contact: Interior_Press@ios.doi.gov

WASHINGTON — The Department of the Interior today announced a $33 million investment through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to put people to work plugging, remediating and reclaiming orphaned oil and gas wells in national parks, national forests, national wildlife refuges, and on other public lands. Four bureaus within the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture will address 277 high-priority polluting wells that pose threats to human health and safety, the climate and wildlife.

“I have seen firsthand how the orphaned oil and gas wells left behind by extractive industries lead to hazardous pollution, water contamination, and safety hazards for our communities,” said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. “Through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are making the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history and taking an all-of-government approach to addressing the environmental impacts from these legacy developments while creating good paying jobs in states across the country.”

“Millions of Americans live within a mile of hundreds of thousands of orphaned oil and gas wells. These wells jeopardize public health and safety by contaminating groundwater, seeping toxic chemicals, emitting harmful pollutants including methane, and harming wildlife,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Laura Daniel-Davis. “We are grateful that investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will enable the federal government to do our part to address this legacy pollution.”

Today's allocation is part of a total of $250 million provided through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for cleaning up orphaned wells and well sites on federal public lands, national parks, national wildlife refuges and national forests. Funding will be distributed to four agencies for work in California, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and West Virginia. The agencies are expected to immediately begin the process to acquire plugging and reclamation services through contracts and grants.

Agencies receiving funding will measure methane emissions before and after plugging using a methane measurement protocol developed by the multi-agency Technical Working Group. The Department of the Interior is also working on developing a database to collect information as wells are plugged and to capture these measurements for future Congressional reporting. The agencies have also prioritized wells that impact disadvantaged communities in keeping with the Administration’s Justice40 initiative to deliver at least 40 percent of the benefits of climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities.

"Environmental toxins are worsening obesity pandemic, say scientists","Chemical pollution in the environment is supersizing the global obesity epidemic, according to a major scientific review.

The idea that the toxins called “obesogens” can affect how the body controls weight is not yet part of mainstream medicine. But the dozens of scientists behind the review argue that the evidence is now so strong that it should be. “This is critical because the current clinical management of obese patients is woefully inadequate,” they said.

The most disturbing aspect of the evidence is that some chemical impacts that increase weight can be passed down through generations by changing how genes work. Pollutants cited by the researchers as increasing obesity include bisphenol A (BPA), which is widely added to plastics, as well as some pesticides, flame retardants and air pollution.

Global obesity has tripled since 1975, with more people now obese or overweight than underweight, and is increasing in every country studied. Almost 2 billion adults are now too heavy and 40 million children under five are obese or overweight.

“The focus of the clinical people is on calories – if you eat more calories, you’re going to be more fat,” says Dr Jerrold Heindel, lead author of one of the three review papers, and formerly at the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. “So they wait untill you get obese, then they’ll look at giving you diets, drugs, or surgery.

“If that really worked, we should see a decline in the rates of obesity,” he said. “But we don’t – obesity continues to rise, especially in children. The real question is, why do people eat more? The obesogenic paradigm focuses on that and provides data that indicate that these chemicals are what can do that.”

Furthermore, the scientists say, the approach offers the potential to prevent obesity by avoiding exposure to pollutants, especially in pregnant women and babies: “Prevention saves lives, while costing far less than any [treatment].”

Strong evidence

The evidence for obesogens is set out by more than 40 scientists in three review papers, published in the peer-reviewed journal Biochemical Pharmacology and citing 1,400 studies. They say these chemicals are everywhere: in water and dust, food packaging, personal hygiene products and household cleaners, furniture and electronics.

The review identifies about 50 chemicals as having good evidence of obesogenic effects, from experiments on human cells and animals, and epidemiological studies of people. These include BPA and phthalates, also a plastic additive. A 2020 analysis of 15 studies found a significant link between BPA levels and obesity in adults in 12 of them.

Other obesogens are pesticides, including DDT and tributyltin, former flame retardants and their newer replacements, dioxins and PCBs, and air pollution. Several recent studies link exposure to dirty air early in life to obesity.

The review also names PFAS compounds – so-called “forever chemicals” due to their longevity in the environment – as obesogens. These are found in food packaging, cookware, and furniture, including some child car seats. A two-year, randomised clinical trial published in 2018 found people with the highest PFAS levels regained more weight after dieting, especially women.

Some antidepressants are also well known to cause weight gain. “That is a proof of principle that chemicals made for one thing can have side effects that interfere with your metabolism,” said Heindel. Other chemicals with some evidence of being obesogens included some artificial sweeteners and triclosan, an antibacterial agent banned from some uses in the US in 2017.

How it works

Obesogens work by upsetting the body’s “metabolic thermostat”, the researchers said, making gaining weight easier and losing weight harder. The body’s balance of energy intake and expenditure through activity relies on the interplay of various hormones from fat tissue, the gut, pancreas, liver, and brain.

The pollutants can directly affect the number and size of fat cells, alter the signals that make people feel full, change thyroid function and the dopamine reward system, the scientists said. They can also affect the microbiome in the gut and cause weight gain by making the uptake of calories from the intestines more efficient.

“It turns out chemicals dumped in the environment have these side effects, because they make the cells do things that they wouldn’t otherwise have done, and one of those things is laying down fat,” said Prof Robert Lustig at the University of California, San Francisco, and lead author of another of the reviews.

The early years of child development are the most vulnerable to obesogens, the researchers wrote: “Studies showed that in utero and early-life exposures were the most sensitive times, because this irreversibly altered programming of various parts of the metabolic system, increasing susceptibility for weight gain.”

“We’ve got four or five chemicals that also will cause transgenerational epigenetic obesity,” said Heindel, referring to changes in the expression of genes that can be inherited. A 2021 study found that women’s level of obesity significantly correlated with their grandmothers’ level of exposure to DDT, even though their granddaughters were never directly exposed to the now banned-pesticide.

“People need to know that [obesogenic effects] are going on,” Lustig said. “Because it affects not just them, but their unborn children. This problem’s going to affect generation after generation until we get a hold of it.”

Cause and effect

Directly proving a causal link between a hazard and a human health impact is difficult for the simple reason that it is not ethical to perform harmful experiments on people. But strong epidemiological evidence can stack up to a level equivalent to proof, such as with tobacco smoking and lung cancer.

Lustig said that point had been reached for obesogens, 16 years after the term was first coined. “We’ll never have randomised control trials – they would be illegal and unethical. But we now have the proof for obesogens and obesity.”

The obesogen paradigm has not been taken up by mainstream researchers so far. But Prof Barbara Corkey, at Boston University School of Medicine and past president of the Obesity Society, said: “The initial worldview was that obesity is caused by eating too much and exercising too little. And this is nonsense.

“It’s not the explanation because all of the creatures on Earth, including humans, eat when they’re hungry and stop when they are full. Every cell in the body knows if you have enough food,” she said. “Something has disrupted that normal sensing apparatus and it is not volition.

“People who are overweight and obese go to tremendous extremes to lose weight and the diet industry has fared extremely well,” Corky said. “We’ve learned that doesn’t work. When the medical profession doesn’t understand something, we always blame patients and unfortunately, people are still being held responsible for [obesity].”

Lustig said: “Gluttony and sloth are just the outward manifestations of these biochemical perturbations that are going on beneath the surface.”

Super-sized

How much of the obesity pandemic may be caused by obesogens is not known, though Heindel said they will have an “important role”.

Lustig said: “If I had to guess, based on all the work and reading I’ve done, I would say obesogens will account for about 15% to 20% of the obesity epidemic. But that’s a lot.” The rest he attributes to processed food diets, which themselves contain some obesogens.

“Fructose is a primary driver of a lot of this,” he said. “It partitions energy to fat in the liver and is a prime obesogen. Fructose would cause obesity even if it didn’t have calories.” A small 2021 trial found that an ultra-processed diet caused more weight gain than an unprocessed diet, despite containing the same calories in the meals offered to participants.

Cutting exposure to obesogens is difficult, given that there are now 350,000 synthetic chemicals, many of which are pervasive in the environment. But those known to be harmful can be removed from sale, as is happening in Europe.

Heindel said prospective mothers in particular could adjust what they eat and monitor what their children play with in their early years: “Studies have shown modifying diets can within a week or so cause a significant drop in several obesogens.”

Lustig said: “This cause is very pervasive and pernicious, and it’s also lucrative to a lot of [chemical] companies. But we must address it rationally.” To do that, the “knowledge gap” among doctors, regulators and policymakers must be addressed, the scientists said.

“It’s time now that [obesity researchers and clinicians] should start paying attention and, if they don’t think the data is strong enough, tell us what more to do,” said Heindel, who is organising a conference to tackle this issue.

Corkey is yet to be fully convinced by the obesogen paradigm, but said the concept of an environmental toxin is probably the right direction to go in. “Is there proof? No, there is not,” she said. “It’s a very difficult problem, because the number of chemicals in our environment has just astronomically increased.

“But there’s no alternative hypothesis that to me makes any sense and I would certainly challenge anyone who has a better, testable idea to come forth with it,” she said. “Because this is a serious problem that is impacting our societies enormously, especially children. The problems are getting worse, not better – we’re going in the wrong direction as it stands.”",,[],['Damian Carrington']
Which priorities should a global plastic pollution treaty focus on? 5 leaders weigh in,"The United Nations Environment Assembly made history in March 2022, by adopting a resolution setting up the path to a legally binding global treaty to end plastic pollution.

But not all questions and challenges have been resolved yet. As we move forward, some important questions should be considered as negotiations begin.

Here is what five leaders believe are the priorities and perspectives a global treaty on plastic pollution offers.

The United Nations Environment Assembly made history in March 2022, by adopting a resolution setting up the path to a legally binding global treaty to end plastic pollution. Heads of State, environment ministers and other representatives from 175 nations agreed on a resolution. Based on three initial draft resolutions from various nations, the resolution addresses the full lifecycle of plastic, its production, design and disposal. Crucial to delivering this, member states established an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) to draft a legally binding agreement by 2024.

This year’s Annual Meeting in Davos will bring together stakeholders from business, government and civil society to highlight how policies and actions taken should be fair, inclusive and truly sustainable, serving both people and the planet.

As we move forward, some important questions should be considered as negotiations begin, including: How will regulations need to differ among emerging and developed economies? How will the agreement be designed to be fair while considering the differences? How willing are countries and companies to enforce regulations on reduction, production and consumption?

'System-wide change is needed'

Kristin Hughes, Director, Global Plastic Action Partnership

Global efforts to stem the tide of plastic pollution are falling by the wayside and the scale of the problem is growing exponentially. Plastic pollution continues to hit the headlines around the world as we increasingly understand the economic, health, ecological and social impact it has on people and the planet. There’s no doubt a system-wide change is needed. This requires countries to adopt national and city-level action plans. Even as we seek to agree on ambitious global targets, we must also proceed with local commitments and action.

Yet, national action only tackles one part of the equation. Regardless of how good some governments are at eliminating plastic pollution within their own borders, unless all countries adopt concerted efforts and are held to strong governance standards, without a truly global solution, countries will continue to deal with the plastic pollution of others. We need a solution to bring this work together. As negotiators begin to consider an international treaty on plastic pollution, they must ensure that the agreement delivers ambitious targets requiring national action plans and include approaches to strategic financing, common reporting and monitoring, innovative solutions, circularity-supporting trade policies, behaviour change campaigns and proper governance. Actions included by the INC will have different implications on stakeholders across the value chain. Businesses, the finance sector, civil society and marginalised communities all need their voices heard for any truly inclusive treaty to prevail.

As we seek ways to address the plastic pollution crisis, we must ensure that a binding agreement on plastic pollution delivers a win-win approach rather than a zero-sum game.

'Building a circular economy for plastic'

Jacob Duer, President and CEO, Alliance to End Plastic Waste

Financing is critical to the success of the new global agreement. The cost of providing waste management to over 3 billion people is significant, yet, ending plastic waste is also a tremendous investment opportunity. Traditional financial institutions, as well as new financing players such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, can capitalise on the surging global demand for recycled plastics to fund solutions at scale that could turn billions of investment capital into a $1 trillion circular economy for plastics that supports both developed and developing countries globally. Governments, businesses and investors are starting to mobilise capital towards funding projects, creating markets to supply customer demand at scale, as well as enhancing physical infrastructure and economics of recycling. To accelerate this process, public-private sector collaboration powered by catalytic finance to end plastic waste has never been more important.

'Most important global environmental agreement'

Inger Andersen, Executive Director, United Nations Environment Programme

At the 5th UN Environment Assembly, countries agreed to embark on negotiations towards a legally binding international treaty to end plastic pollution. Aiming to tackle the full life cycle of plastic pollution, such a historic agreement offers us a huge opportunity to transition to a new circular plastics economy, one where businesses innovate across the plastics value chain. Such an agreement will give us a real shot at putting the brakes on one of the most visible signs of unsustainable consumption and production – plastic pollution of our land and seas. In so doing, we stand on the cusp of the most important global environmental agreement since the Paris Agreement. It is now time for governments, businesses and people to rise to the challenge so we land this firmly together.

'Creating a ground-breaking precedent'

Ines Yabar, Sustainability Activist, Peru

The global Plastic Pollution Treaty is a great way to get commitments that we can all move forward with on paper. As with many treaties, it runs the risk of being treated as the objective not as merely one step in the right direction. As a young activist, I am looking forward to this treaty being ambitious but more importantly for it to set the stage for concrete actions attached to a results framework that tracks policies, reduces plastic production and puts funding behind upstream solutions. This treaty should demonstrate teamwork (beyond individual commitments), be prompt (not pushing the timelines further behind), and be legally binding (with consequences for those who don't comply).

With the clear link of climate change and plastic pollution as well as the increasing evidence of health risks linked to plastics, the treaty should be ready to hit the ground running. It's not time for more words but it is certainly time for action. This treaty has the chance to create a ground-breaking precedent of what our world could look like if we all come together committed to action, but it could also be one more document gathering dust. Young people and civil society are certainly ready to continue the work and we look forward to the commitments being followed through, the funding being secured and the laws being put in place so that we can look back at this moment and know the treaty was a success.

Plastic pollution: European farmland could be largest global reservoir of microplastics,"Plastic particles smaller than 5mm (known as microplastics) are well-documented pollutants in ocean and freshwater habitats. The discovery of microplastics in the most remote rivers of the Himalayas and the deepest trenches of the Pacific Ocean has sparked widespread concern. But how much microplastic lies closer to home – buried in the soil where food is grown?

Our latest study estimated that between 31,000 and 42,000 tonnes of microplastics (or 86 trillion – 710 trillion microplastic particles) are spread on European farmland soils each year, mirroring the concentration of microplastics in ocean surface waters.

The cause is microplastic-laden fertilisers derived from sewage sludge diverted from wastewater treatment plants. These are commonly spread on farmland as a renewable source of fertiliser throughout European countries, in part due to EU directives that aim to promote a circular waste economy.

As well as creating a massive reservoir of environmental microplastics, this practice is effectively undoing the benefit of removing these particles from wastewater. Spreading microplastics onto farmland will eventually return them to natural watercourses, as rain washes water on the surface of soil into rivers, or it eventually infiltrates groundwater.

Wastewater treatment plants remove solid contaminants (such as plastics and other large particles) from raw sewage and drain water using a series of settling tanks. This produces an effluent of clean water that can be released to the environment. The floating material and settled particles from these tanks are combined to form the sludge used as fertiliser.

We found that up to 650 million microplastic particles between 1mm and 5mm in size entered a wastewater treatment plant in south Wales, UK, every day. All of these particles were separated from the incoming sewage and diverted into the sludge rather than being released with the clean effluent. This demonstrates how effective default wastewater treatment can be for removing microplastics.

At this facility, each gram of sewage sludge contained up to 24 microplastic particles, which was roughly 1% of its weight. In Europe, an estimated 8 million to 10 million tonnes of sewage sludge is generated each year, with around 40% sent to farmland. The spreading of sewage sludge on agricultural soil is widely practised across Europe, owing to the nitrogen and phosphorus it offers crops.

UK farms also use sewage sludge as fertiliser. In our study, the UK had the highest amount of microplastic pollution within its soils across all European nations (followed by Spain, Portugal and Germany). Between 500 and 1,000 microplastic particles are applied to each square metre of agricultural land in the UK every year.

A poisoned circular waste economy

At present, there are no adequate solutions to the release of microplastics into the environment from wastewater treatment plants.

Microplastics removed from wastewater are effectively transported to the land, where they reside until being returned to waterways. According to a study conducted in Ontario, Canada, 99% of microplastics in agricultural soil were transported away from where the sludge was initially applied.

Until then, they have the potential to harm life in the soil. As well as being easily consumed and absorbed by animals and plants, microplastics pose a serious threat to the soil ecosystem because they leach toxic chemicals and transport hazardous pathogens. Experiments have shown that the presence of microplastics can stunt earthworm growth and cause them to lose weight.

Microplastics can also change the acidity, water holding capacity and porosity of soil. This affects plant growth and performance by altering the way roots bury into the soil and take up nutrients.

There is currently no European legislation to limit the amount of microplastics embedded in sewage sludge used as fertiliser. Germany has set upper limits for impurities like glass and plastic, allowing up to 0.1% of wet fertiliser weight to constitute plastics larger than 2mm in size. According to the results from the wastewater treatment plant in south Wales, applying sewage sludge would be prohibited if similar legislation were in place in the UK.

For the time being, landowners are likely to continue recycling sewage sludge as sustainable fertiliser, despite the risk of contaminating soils and eventually rivers and the ocean with microplastics.",,[],"['James Lofty', 'Pablo Ouro', 'Valentine Muhawenimana']"

The pollution from rockets built by SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic could damage human health and hurt the Earth's climate, a new study shows.

""Atmospheric pollution from rockets,"" published Tuesday in the journal Physics of Fluids, digitally modelled the exhaust gases coming from a standard rocket, similar to one of SpaceX's reusable Falcon 9s, at various altitudes.

The increase in rocket launches by commercial space companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic ""could have a significant cumulative effect on climate,"" the study said. This is because of the amount of carbon gases and nitrogen oxides being produced with each launch, the study said.

The study found that the concentration of nitrogen oxides, which an ascending rocket releases into two cubic kilometers of atmospheric air, was considered ""hazardous to human health"" under the World Health Organization's (WHO) standards.

""The impact on the atmosphere will be a crucial factor requiring careful consideration in the design of future rocket launches,"" the study's authors, Ioannis Kokkinakis and Dimitris Drikakis, wrote.

As the number of commercial rocket rides climb, the consequent pollution in the atmosphere must be looked into, the authors added.

A Blue Origin spokesperson told Insider that the New Shepard rocket is ""fueled by highly efficient and clean liquid oxygen and hydrogen"" and the only byproduct is ""water vapor with no carbon emissions.""

Blue Origin is planning its fifth human flight to the edge of space in May after already launching its resuable New Shepard rocket in March. Its first mission to launch humans to space was in July when Bezos and his brother were passengers onboard.

SpaceX, which builds reusable rockets, completed 31 flights in 2021, which was a record high for the company. It plans to launch 60 rockets in 2022, Musk said in a tweet in March.

Meanwhile, Virgin Galactic said it's planning to ramp up tourist flights next year, aiming to send customers to space three times per month with its reusable rocket.",,[],['Kate Duffy']

A ‘New Era of Air Pollution’ in the Tropics Could Have a Huge Toll,"In many cities, concentrations of some pollutants declined while others increased. But Jakarta, Indonesia, was the only one that saw a statistically significant improvement in overall air quality as a result of governmental policies.

Improvement is relative as Jakarta still has a severe air pollution problem, but the trends there pointed to how effective targeted policies could be at reducing pollution. The city has emission standards for vehicles, the researchers noted, and saw a decrease in nitrogen dioxide, which is associated with vehicle exhaust. But it does not have limits on biomass burning, such as burning land to clear it after a harvest, and it saw increased concentrations of ammonia, which is associated with such agricultural activities.

Overall, however, the researchers found that most of the increased pollution was driven not by biomass burning but by sources like traffic and fuel burning — a distinction the researchers were able to make because biomass burning shows up in satellite observations in intense but relatively short bursts, usually with a seasonal pattern. Other human activities produce less intense but more sustained pollution.

“Open burning of biomass for land clearance and agricultural waste disposal has in the past overwhelmingly dominated air pollution in the tropics,” Karn Vohra, a research fellow at University College London and the lead author of the study, said in a statement. “Our analysis suggests we’re entering a new era of air pollution in these cities, with some experiencing rates of degradation in a year that other cities experience in a decade.”

The study does not answer the question of what activities, specifically, are most responsible.

“The driver of these trends is anthropogenic activity, but that’s very broad — there’s so much anthropogenic activity that takes place within a city,” Dr. Marais said, adding that further scientific research was needed to identify the largest contributors.",,[],['Maggie Astor']

The Industrial Revolution and Its Effects on Air Quality

Sometime between 1820 and 1840, Great Britain and other European countries, along with the United States, began a transition to new manufacturing processes that became known as the Industrial Revolution. This process included the rise of the mechanised factory system to replace hand production methods, chemical manufacturing, iron production as well as an increase in the use of steam and water power, all of which implicated the need for more natural resources such as coal and iron.

Industrialisation has created massive consequences for the environment, affecting first and foremost the air quality in developing urban areas. The expansion of factories and the rise in coal consumption and combustion gave rise to unprecedented levels of air pollution due to the dramatic increase in emissions of primary pollutants. The growing population also played a role, with private households substantially contributing to an increase in domestic emissions from burning coal for heating and cooking. The amount of pollutants in the air first increased in cities but later spread across countries. It quickly became a much larger-scale issue when global trade took off, turning air pollution into one of the harshest consequences of industrial growth across the world.

Europe and North America – the continents that first experienced rapid industrial growth – were not surprisingly also the ones most impacted by emissions and, for most of the second half of the twentieth century, they suffered the majority of adverse effects of air pollution. Until 1970, both continents combined were responsible for more than 80% of the global sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions.

Four Signs of Deteriorating Air Quality in the 20th Century

Until the 1980s, the most investigated environmental factors related to deteriorating air quality dealt with scientific discoveries of how air pollution impacted rain, ecosystems, and the ozone layer.

The Great Smog of London (1952)

In December 1952, London was affected by one of the most severe events related to air pollution in the city’s history: the so-called Great Smog of London. For four days, the UK’s capital was covered in a thick layer of lethal smog, as airborne pollutants arising mostly from coal combustion accumulated in the air. The event was responsible for the premature death of an estimated 12,000 people. Apart from killing as many as 4,000 people directly, the smog made more than 100,000 ill, as it contributed to a steep rise in respiratory infections.

This environmental disaster led to the adoption of the Clean Air Act four years later, passed with the aim of tackling air pollution arising from industrial activities. The Act was a very important step and led to significant reductions in emissions in urban areas as well as to the closure of many urban power stations and other polluting industrial infrastructure.

Figure 1: The Decline in SO2 London following the Clean Air Act in 1956

Acid Rain

First identified in North America in the 1960s, acid rain became the number one air-related issue. It was quickly classified as a direct consequence of air pollution that affected the environment, corroding surfaces, increasing the acidification of freshwaters, and contributing to the overall loss of biodiversity – mainly aquatic animal species. Between the 1960s and 1970s, this phenomenon became one of the most pressing environmental problems in Europe and North America. As scientists began investigating the causes of acid rain, they found a clear link between this phenomenon and the long-range transport of pollutants such as sulphur (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) from power plants located in some of the world’s major emitting countries.

Once the dangerous effects of acid rain were discovered, many countries stepped up their efforts in reducing emissions of these two pollutants, instituting an international framework – the 1979 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). The agreement required extensive monitoring of emissions as well as a plan for interpretation of the data and concrete action. In the following years, several acid rain-related policies were also passed. The most influential was the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. It established the US Acid Rain Program, aimed at setting targets to reduce emissions and implement policies to achieve it in two phases starting in 1995 and 2000 respectively. Nationwide, emissions dropped significantly: the US recorded an annual reduction in SO2 of over 93%, while NOx decreased by over 87% annually.

Deforestation and the Eutrophication of Ecosystems by Nitrogen Deposition

In the 1980s, another effect of air pollution became evident. Experts began noticing accelerated forest loss across several European countries, especially in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany. The deteriorating health of forests suddenly became a primary concern for the scientific community, who started noticing a link between the worsening air quality and deforestation.

Furthermore, as experts were developing an increased understanding of air contamination issues, a more dangerous pollutant than sulphur, nitrogen oxide, came under scrutiny. About 95% of NOx comes from human activities like the burning of coal, gasoline, and oil in vehicles, homes, industries, and power plants. The Netherlands and the UK were the first countries to observe abnormal changes in botanical species composition of heathlands. Eutrophication, a phenomenon responsible for the reduction in species richness of grasslands due to high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen in bodies of water, was soon discovered to be another consequence of air pollution emissions that affected ecosystems not only across European regions but also in North America and China.

Ground-level Ozone

In the second half of the 20th century, another highly polluting gas, ground-level ozone, was discovered. Classified as a “secondary” pollutant as it is the product of two primary pollutants – nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds – this gas forms above the Earth’s surface and it is extremely threatening to human health. For this reason, it was listed in the aforementioned Clean Air Act along with other six air pollutants. Ground-level ozone was quickly associated with premature mortality and a range of health issues and diseases of the respiratory tract and it was found to also affect sensitive vegetation and ecosystems including forests.

A Shift Towards China and the Asia-Pacific region

After learning about the threats of air pollution to humans and the environment, both Europe and North America – the countries most affected by this phenomenon throughout the 20th century – took important steps in controlling and reducing their emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxide. Meanwhile, other regions of the world have started their own Industrial Revolutions.

Until the early 1970s, Asia was the poorest continent in the world. However, in the second half of the 20th century, it experienced a profound economic transformation that led several Asian countries to become global economic leaders. Today, the entire continent accounts for nearly 40% of the global economy. Asia’s rapid and unprecedented economic growth of nearly 6% a year for the past 25 years, contributed to a shift from North America and Europe, which dominated global emissions until the early 1980s, to Central, East, and South Asia. The population growth that gave rise to some of the world’s largest ‘megacities’ and the rapid economic expansion of these regions led to a surge in oil and coal, which quickly became the biggest sources of fuel. Meanwhile, countries like India and Pakistan also underwent huge industrialisation and urbanisation, which eventually turned them into the world’s worst countries for air quality.

Figure 2: Global Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) Emissions by World Region, 1850-2010

In the same years, advances were made in the detection of emissions and scientists developed a better understanding of some of the issues related to air pollution. At the beginning of the 21st century, new measurements, satellite remote sensing – which provided global data on primary and secondary pollutants distribution, and new epidemiological evidence brought the effects of air pollution on human health to the top of political agendas worldwide. Despite a 90% decline in SO2 emissions in Europe and North America from their peak in the 1970s, new pollutants that are responsible for millions of premature deaths and health issues worldwide have been discovered since.

Air Pollution Today

Effects of air pollution on humans overtook those on natural ecosystems in scientific research. Modern studies related to air quality now focus on a new pollutant, particulate matter (PM). The term refers to the sum of all solid and liquid particles suspended in the air of different sizes and it is considered the main contributor to human health effects by some margin. The most commonly used unit in air quality measurements is PM2.5 (see Figure 2), which refers to an atmospheric particulate matter that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers (or about 3% the diameter of a human hair) and is said to pose the greatest risk to human health.

Contrary to the 20th century, the worst air quality in the world is found in the Global South, especially in developing countries in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. There are many reasons that explain this discrepancy. First and foremost, developing nations are rich in fossil fuels, and coal power plants remain prevalent in these regions. They also heavily rely on solid fuels that are responsible for severe indoor air pollution, such as wood, crop wastes, charcoal, and coal as well as kerosene for cooking, heating, and lighting. Furthermore, they lack technologies and economic resources to fight air pollution and its effects, such as adequate health systems to cure diseases related to this phenomenon. Finally, developing countries have weak laws and policies, such as less stringent vehicle emission standards than the ones of developed nations.

Six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities in 2021 were in India, with Bhiwadi topping the list with an average annual concentration of PM2.5 of 106.2. In the country, air pollution is the second biggest risk factor for disease and it costs the Indian economy nearly USD$150 billion dollars every year. 20-35% of its total urban PM2.5 concentrations are due to internal combustion engines in motor vehicles.

Future Outlook

Looking at the history of air pollution is important to understand how one of the most pressing environmental issues in the contemporary world came about. While history shows that countries have taken action before to stop the spread of certain chemicals believed to be the cause of air pollution, not enough has been done. Modern societies still rely on extremely polluting activities and energy sources, and air pollution is far from being a problem of the past. Instead, it still represents a colossal economic burden, which costs countries around the world USD$5 trillion every year. While we try to stop global warming and prevent climate change from irreversibly damaging our planet, we need to take more decisive actions such as closing polluting power plants while also reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and eventually relying completely on renewable energy. This also means shifting to cleaner transport means such as electric vehicles, improving industry and waste management in cities, building energy-efficient housing as well as investing in green power generation.",,[],[]
Scientists Say: Pollution,"Pollution (noun, “Puh-LOO-shun”)

Pollution is any harmful substance or form of energy released into the environment. Some pollution is natural. Volcanic eruptions blow ash and toxic gases into the air. Some oil naturally seeps into oceans through the seafloor. But pollution usually refers to contamination caused by people. Human activity dirties air, water and land alike.

Cars and factories, for instance, send pollutants such as nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide into the air. These chemicals give rise to smog. That haze of pollution can lead to health problems and make it hard to breathe. Burning fossil fuels also releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. These gases are warming Earth’s climate.

Chemicals such as lawn and farm fertilizers, meanwhile, seep into streams and lakes. Those chemicals can feed harmful algal blooms. This overgrowth of algae can make water unsafe plants and animals. Other pollutants can make water dangerous for people to drink. Plastic trash causes trouble in the oceans, where animals may mistake it for food.

Recycling materials such as glass, metals, paper and plastic can reduce this trash. Laws and agreements between nations can also limit how much pollution people and companies create. In 1987, for instance, nearly 200 countries agreed to the Montreal Protocol. This agreement phased out chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. These chemicals were eating a hole in Earth’s ozone layer. Since then, the ozone layer has started to recover.

Some types of pollution are not physical. Light pollution, for example, is human-made light in places that should be dark. Light from cars, buildings and streetlamps are sources of light pollution. This glow can mess up the sleep cycles of people and animals. Similarly, noise pollution is disruptive sound. Noise from construction and transportation can make it harder for birds to communicate. And ship noise may drive fish and whales away from their feeding grounds. Noise pollution can also cause hearing loss in people.

Recent research suggests that worldwide, air pollution lowers people’s average life span by a year.

Growing evidence links air pollution exposure and covid-19 risks,"Placeholder while article actions load

Research has shown that being unvaccinated raises a person’s risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus, while being older, overweight or immunocompromised can increase the severity of covid-19. Now scientists think there is another risk factor that may increase the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus and the possibility that it will lead to a poor outcome: exposure to air pollution.

A growing body of evidence suggests links between breathing polluted air and the chances of being infected by the coronavirus, developing a severe illness or dying of covid-19. Although many of these studies focused on long-term exposure to air pollution, experts say there is also building evidence that even short-term exposures may have negative effects.

A recent study of 425 younger adults in Sweden found that brief exposures were “associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection despite relatively low levels of air pollution exposure,” according to the paper published in April. Unlike many other studies that analyzed vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or young children, and tracked the effects of long-term exposures on hospitalizations and deaths, the median age of participants, who largely reported mild to moderate symptoms, was about 25 years old.

The findings will hopefully raise awareness “that actually these kind of exposures can be harmful for everyone,” said Erik Melén, the study’s principal investigator and a professor in the clinical sciences and education department at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden.

Zhebin Yu, the study’s lead author and a researcher with the Karolinska Institutet, noted that the research was based on unvaccinated people during an earlier phase of the pandemic. So the results, he said, may not be applicable to more recent coronavirus variants, such as omicron, and vaccinated individuals.

The findings, however, add to the understanding that when it comes to health effects, including covid risk, “there is no safe limit or safe threshold of air pollution,” said Olena Gruzieva, an associate professor at the Karolinska Institutet who worked on the study.

Scientists are still trying to determine how air pollution exposure might be increasing covid risks. But there are some theories.

Exposure to pollutants, for example, is linked to inflammation and an imbalance in the body known as oxidative stress — both of which could exaggerate a person’s response to any virus, including the coronavirus, said Meredith McCormack, a volunteer medical spokesperson with the American Lung Association.

Another theory suggests that breathing polluted air might help the virus penetrate deeper into the body or cells, added McCormack, who is an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins. Pollution can also impair the immune response.

The pollution exposures documented in many of the studies that have shown an effect on covid are generally below current regulatory standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency, said Alison Lee. Lee is a lung specialist at Mount Sinai in New York who has published research on air pollution and covid.

It’s critical, McCormack and other experts said, for people to protect themselves on poorer air-quality days and for individuals and governments to work toward reducing air pollution.

“The transition toward a green economy with green renewable energy resources will really further protect both the environment and public health, and it’s also very closely related to the climate change crisis,” said Donghai Liang, an assistant professor of environmental health and epidemiology at Emory University.

Concerns about air pollution exposure and covid have existed since the early months of the pandemic. A study from Harvard University that analyzed coronavirus data from counties in the United States up to June 2020 found that “a small increase in long-term exposure” to fine particulate matter — one of the most insidious types of air pollution — “leads to a large increase in the covid-19 death rate.”

Another study of U.S. county-level data from the first few months of the pandemic reported that chronic exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), an air pollutant that comes from traffic and power plants, was associated with significant increases in covid fatality and mortality rates.

“If we did a better job earlier, if we could have reduced long-term exposure to NO2 by 10 percent, it would have avoided more than 14,000 deaths among those people who tested positive for the virus back in July 2020,” said Liang, the study’s lead author.

Researchers and outside experts noted that such observational population-based studies cannot account for individual risk factors that may affect a person’s chances of becoming severely sick or dying after contracting the coronavirus.

A “more rigorous approach” is to follow individuals over a period of time and track who becomes infected with the virus, then who develops severe covid symptoms, requires hospitalization or dies, said Kai Chen, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health and director of research at the Yale Center on Climate Change and Health.

He and other experts called for further research to clear up some key questions.

“There’s still some uncertainty in the magnitude of the risk,” McCormack said. “For a given increase in air pollution on a given day, does that increase your risk of getting covid by 1 percent or 5 percent, more than 5 percent? Those estimates are still being refined.”

Researchers also need to determine exactly what may be influencing a person’s risk of contracting the coronavirus and the severity of infection, said Chen, who published a study showing that certain meteorological factors, such as humidity, could affect the virus’s ability to spread. If a major confounding variable isn’t controlled for in a study’s statistical analysis, it could lead to overestimating the effect of air pollution, he said.

Additionally, research should continue into the potential harms of short-term exposure, Lee said. “It’s important to see the short-term data, because these data fill a critical data gap and thus have policy implications.”

Advertisement

Because long-term data averages exposures over longer periods, it “can hide spikes in exposure,” Lee said. Lower-income communities and people of color, many of whom tend to live closer to sources of air pollution, are often disproportionately affected by such spikes. “By strengthening both long-term and short-term air-quality standards​ and placing more regulatory monitors near these exposure hot spots, we can better improve health in environmental justice communities,” she said.

Whether increased exposure to pollutants is responsible for pandemic-related health disparities in these communities, which have been hit harder by the coronavirus, is unclear, McCormack said. “We haven’t had a study yet that disentangles all of the factors,” she said, “but we definitely know that by quantifying the effect of air pollution on covid infection, we have evidence that that’s one of the driving forces that likely contributes to the differences we’ve seen, but it’s one of several.”

Experts said they hope the findings connecting air quality and covid will help push the issue of air pollution’s toll on our health to the forefront of public consciousness.

“Air pollution is like a silent pandemic,” Chen said. While pollution’s effect on the environment is well-known, fewer people might be aware that outdoor and indoor air pollution exposure causes an estimated 7 million premature deaths worldwide each year, and is associated with lung and heart disease, among other serious health issues.

The coronavirus pandemic, however, “has really heightened awareness of the importance of clean air,” McCormack said.

Lee agreed. “The overarching takeaway from all of these studies is that air pollution is bad and that we really need to fight for more protective air-quality standards,” she said.

Does Air Pollution Cause Dementia? Here’s What We Know So Far,"As research continues on risk factors for dementia, exposure to airborne pollutants has continued to garner attention as a target for preventive efforts. In 2020, the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care added air pollution as one of 12 potentially modifiable risk factors that together may prevent or delay approximately 40% of dementia cases worldwide.1

The addition was based on accumulating evidence in recent years that shows support for this relationship. Multiple studies have found associations between air pollution exposure and an increased risk for dementia, while improved air quality has been linked with a lower dementia risk.2-5,7

In a 2021 national cohort studybased on Medicare data from 2000-2018, Shi et al examined records pertaining to nearly 25 million beneficiaries to determine associations between exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and ozone (O 3 ) and the incidence of dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD).2

Continue Reading

For incident dementia, hazard ratios (HRs) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in the 5-year average exposure to PM 2.5 (3.2 µg/m3) and NO 2 (11.6 ppb) prior to diagnosis were 1.060 (95% CI, 1.054-1.066) and 1.019 (95% CI, 1.012-1.026), respectively. For incident AD, HRs per IQR increase were 1.078 (95% CI, 1.070-1.086) and 1.031 (95% CI, 1.023-1.039), respectively. These relationships were approximately linear. No increase in HRs for O 3 was observed for incident dementia (HR, 0.990; 95% CI, 0.987-0.993) or incident AD (HR, 0.982; 95% CI, 0.977-0.986).2

In a 2021 cohort study of 7066 older adults in France, increasing levels of PM 2.5 exposure were associated with an elevated risk for all-cause dementia, and vascular/mixed dementia over a median 10-year follow-up period. No association was noted for the other 2 pollutants examined in the study, NO 2 and black carbon.3

Results of imaging studies further support these findings, including a 2021 cross-sectional study of 18,178 US adults with cognitive impairment. Greater odds of positive amyloid positron emission tomography scan results were noted in those living in areas with worse air quality, with apparent associations between higher PM 2.5 levels and the presence of brain amyloid-β plaques.4

The association between PM 2.5 levels and the probability of amyloid PET scan positivity “was dose-dependent and statistically significant after adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors as well as medical comorbidities,” the researchers noted.4 No association between higher O 3 exposure and amyloid PET scan positivity was observed in either time frame.

The results of these latest studies are consistent with from previous research that showed positive associations between exposure to various pollutants and the risk for dementia. In a 2019 systematic review of 13 longitudinal studies from the US and several other countries, Peters et al found that higher levels of exposure to PM 2.5 , NO 2 , nitrous oxides, and carbon monoxide were associated with increased dementia risk, while findings regarding O 3 were mixed.5

However, a study published in February 2022 reported that each 10-μg/m3 increase in the annual mean O 3 exposure was associated with a 10.4% increase in the risk of cognitive impairment in a cohort of 9,544 older adults in China, highlighting the need for additional research to elucidate the potential impact of O 3 on the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.6

Other research has demonstrated that improved air quality was associated with reduced dementia risk. Results published in January 2022 linked reductions in the risk of dementia to improvements in PM 2.5 (HR, 0.80 per 1.78 μg/m3; 95% CI, 0.71–0.91) and NO 2 (HR, 0.80 per 3.91 parts per billion; 95% CI, 0.71–0.90) in a cohort of 2239 older women in the US.7

To learn more about these findings and the pollution-dementia connection, we interviewed 2 researchers of the January 2022 study: Jiu-Chiuan Chen, MD, ScD, associate professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles and Diana Younan, PhD, MPH, an epidemiologist who was a senior research associate at USC at the time the study was conducted.

What does research suggest thus far about the relationship between air pollution and the risk for dementia, and what do your recent findings7 add to the conversation?

Dr Chen: The research so far has consistently shown that late-life exposures to outdoor air pollution, especially PM 2.5 , is harmful to aging brains and can even increase the risk [for] dementia. In our previous studies, we identified white matter as a novel target of air pollution neurotoxicity on brain aging.8

We also found that older women living in locations with higher levels of PM 2.5 had more gray matter atrophy that spatially distributed in brain areas vulnerable to AD neuropathology.9 We further showed that such spatial pattern AD-related neurodegeneration led to greater declines in episodic memory in older women who lived in locations with higher PM 2.5 levels.10 Our recent study also reported the association between NO 2 exposure and smaller volumes of the prefrontal cortex and insula.11

Scientists have shown that improved long-term air quality may extend life expectancy in older populations, reduce mortality in adults, improve respiratory health in children, and increase birth weight in newborns. However, what is unknown—and what we were focusing on in our study—was whether improving air quality could improve brain health (i.e., lower the risk [for] dementia). Our study is one of the first to show that improving air quality over time may benefit the brain health of older women by lowering their [dementia risk].7

What are the proposed mechanisms driving the association between air pollution and dementia risk?

Dr Chen: When air pollution is inhaled, the very small particles can penetrate the lungs and enter the circulatory system. Experimental studies in animals have shown that these “toxic” responses may weaken the blood-brain barrier and cause damage to the brain.12

Several scientists also believe that once in the airways or deep in the lung parenchyma, the particles may cause an inflammatory response, leading to activation of immune cells and overproduction of cytokines, which may migrate and enter the central nervous system to cause brain damage. Increasing evidence also suggests that the very small particles may bypass the lungs and blood-brain barrier through the nasal cavity into the olfactory bulb. Additionally, others have speculated that the fine particles may increase the risk for dementia via damage to the vascular systems, although such studies on older populations remain limited.13

What broad measures are needed to address this issue?

Dr Younan: The health benefits seen in our study were a result of decreasing levels of both fine particulate matter and traffic related air pollution (NO 2 ) across the US, which were likely due to national policies and strategies aimed at regulating pollution from stationary sources such as power plants and factories and mobile sources such as vehicles. We and others have found evidence suggesting neurotoxic effects of air pollution even at low levels of exposures. Therefore, we believe that continuing these regulatory efforts are important to help older Americans sustain their brain health.

How should clinicians advise their patients about the link between air pollution and dementia risk?

Dr Chen: Scientists have documented that air pollution can be harmful to the brain for more than 10 years. The 2020 Lancet Commission report1 considered air pollution exposure in late life as an important modifiable risk factor for dementia, thus it is important for clinicians to educate themselves about [the] link between air pollution exposure and resulting damage to aging brains.

Physicians can also encourage patients to maintain awareness of daily air quality via email notification, relevant websites, and weather broadcasts, especially for the elderly and those with heart or lung diseases or diabetes. This would enable patients to plan their outdoor activities accordingly and make efforts to reduce their personal exposure to air pollution, such as avoiding physical activities near busy roadways and keeping air vents and windows closed while driving.

5 Effective Air Pollution Prevention Strategies,"Every year, air pollution is responsible for an estimated seven million premature deaths worldwide. It is also one of the biggest threats to human health, increasing the risk of chronic heart and pulmonary diseases, lung cancer, stroke, and respiratory infections. In addition, it is contributing to the climate crisis and accelerating global warming. Nearly all of the global population is breathing highly polluted air every day. Governments urgently need to commit to air pollution prevention in an effort to solve one of the direst environmental problems in the world right now.

—

Sometime between 1820 and 1840, the world began transitioning to new manufacturing processes that became known as the Industrial Revolution. While this represented a turning point in the history of technological advancement and moulding the world as we know it today, industrialisation came at a huge cost for the environment and affected worldwide air quality, especially in new, developing urban areas. Even today, the highest levels of air pollution are recorded in cities. Six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities in 2021 were in India, with Bhiwadi topping the list, while neighbouring countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh are also some of the worst affected. In China, despite the huge progress made in recent years, where particulate pollution saw a 29% drop globally, 1.25 million people still die prematurely from pollution-related diseases every year.

The world has made remarkable advancements in air pollution reduction technologies and an increasing number of countries around the world have pledged to end all emissions in the coming decades. We explore the main drivers and effects of air pollution on the environment before diving deep into some of the best strategies for air pollution prevention.

Drivers of Air Pollution

Air pollution refers to the release of chemicals and pollutant particles into the air, mainly through human activities. Among the biggest contributors are fossil fuels. Global demand for oil, natural gas, and coal continues to increase despite calls to end our dependence on these energy sources in order to meet net-zero emissions goals. In 2021, global energy-related emissions reached a staggering 36.3 billion tonnes of CO2, their highest-ever level. 40% of which came from coal – soaring to an all-time high of 15.3 billion tonnes – followed by 10.7 billion tonnes from oil, and 7.5 billion tonnes from natural gas.

Another driver is ozone, a toxic gas that turns into smog – an extremely harmful form of air pollution – when it reaches too close to the ground, significantly reducing visibility. Extreme climate events like dust storms as well as changing weather conditions are also responsible for poisoning the atmosphere. For example, high air pressure and heat waves can create stagnant air where pollutants usually concentrate in large quantities. Extreme heat waves also increase the risks of large-scale wildfires, notorious for releasing more carbon emissions, smog, and pollutants into the air.

Effects of Air Pollution on the Environment

Apart from causing millions of premature deaths and illnesses – especially in low-income countries like South and East Asia – there is growing evidence among the scientific community that air pollution can have detrimental impacts on other aspects of human health and wellbeing – such as their cognitive function. Several studies have found that polluted air often impedes or lowers the cognitive ability of those frequently exposed to it.

But air pollution does not only impact humans. Its environmental effects are also vast and worrying. They range from acid rain – which is extremely harmful to the soil and plants – to birth defects, reproductive failure, and diseases among wildlife animals. Highly polluted rain can also compromise agriculture, as it makes crops more vulnerable to diseases from increased UV radiation caused by ozone depletion.

Air Pollution Prevention

While we know much about the causes and effects of air pollution, there is still much to be done in terms of prevention. To understand how governments can tackle the problem, it is useful to have a look at the main sectors contributing to global greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, the only ways to drastically reduce air pollution are to adopt a wide range of policies that regulate all polluting industries – from energy production to transportation and agriculture – as well as to reflect on broader solutions such as carbon tax systems.

Figure 1: World’s Most Polluting Sectors, 2020

1. Cut Down Emissions from Power Plants

One obvious but effective strategy to cut down emissions is to phase out fossil fuels immediately, yet it has proven to be difficult to implement. As the latest IPCC climate report clearly stated, in the race to reach net-zero emissions, there is no room for any fossil fuel developments. Shifting to other energy sources like nuclear and renewables is a long and complicated process that requires global coordination and collaboration. Yet, not all countries are on board and while some are slowly making the transition, others have no intentions of phasing out fossil fuels.

In the meantime, countries like the US are implementing strategies to hold power plants accountable for their pollution. For example, in March 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) unveiled the “Good Neighbor” plan to cut interstate smog pollution from power stations by requiring them to operate their pollution control equipment and keep their daily emissions under a pre-established limit.

2. Decarbonise the Global Transport Sector

Transport accounts for 8 billion tonnes – or approximately one-fifth – of global carbon dioxide emissions. These are expected to grow significantly over the next 30 years as a result of increasing transport demand.

Figure 2: Global CO2 Emissions from Transport, 2018

According to the EPA, there are three methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. The first is to increase the efficiency of vehicle technology. A good start – according to a report by the United Nations – is developing weight reduction and improvements to engines and tires that can make vehicles more fuel-efficient, reduce their reliance on oil, and cut expenses.

One of the most important technologies we have to decarbonise the transport sector is electric vehicles (EV). Significant progress has been made in this industry and costs of batteries have declined by 90% in recent years. Despite EVs being a much better alternative than fossil fuel vehicles, as the latter generate much higher emissions over their lifetime, the electrification of the transportation sector has a dark side. Producing EV batteries requires greater resource extractivism, which has substantial destructive consequences for the environment and local communities, an aspect of this industry that cannot be ignored. Fortunately, EV companies are building a much more sustainable supply chain by improving the efficiency and lifespan of batteries, researching a way to build them using other resources as well as recycling old batteries to reuse raw materials.

But switching to EVs is not the only option we have. We can lower transportation’s carbon footprint by changing how we travel – for example, opting for public transport and car-sharing – as well as how we transport goods around the world. Emissions from the global supply chain have reached historic heights. In 2020, the shipping and return of products within the e-commerce industry alone accounted for 37% of the total GHG emissions, attributing to the unsustainable habits of modern consumers and their appetite for convenience. It is estimated that by 2030, the number of delivery vehicles will increase by 36%, reaching approximately 7.2 million vehicles. This will not only result in an increase of about 6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, but it will also increase commutes by 21%, as vehicles will take longer to travel due to higher traffic congestion. All things considered, the best way to drastically reduce the impact of the shipping industry is by rethinking the means of transport, for example by prioritising rail and marine vessels over truck drivers.

Emissions can also be reduced by using fuels with a minimal carbon footprint such as biofuels, renewable natural gas, hydrogen as well as sustainable aviation fuel. Lastly, it is the governments’ job to implement tighter fuel and vehicle emission standards. As part of its targets to reduce the net greenhouse gas emissions by 50% in 2030, the US has taken into account many sector-specific reduction pathways. The Biden administration is currently working on incentives for zero-emission personal vehicles, funding for charging infrastructure, and support for research in low carbon, new-generation renewable fuels. Simultaneously, sixteen states including California, New York, and Pennsylvania, are imposing their own pollution limits on cars. Similarly, the European Union is encouraging the production of greener vehicles and it has recently strengthened the CO2 standards for cars and vans as a way to facilitate its phase-out of internal combustion engines.

3. Adopt a More Sustainable Approach to Agriculture

Recent data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that 31% of human-caused GHG emissions originate from the world’s agri-food systems. From the 16.5 tonnes generated in 2019, the largest share – 7.2 billion tonnes – came from within the farm gate, 5.8 billion tonnes from the supply-chain processes, while 3.5 billion tonnes from land use change.

Thus, efforts to address the exploitation of resources like land and water as well as the promotion of sustainable agriculture are among the most crucial steps in air pollution prevention. A big issue related to soil depletion is the excessive use of fertilisers. Switching to nitrate-based solutions can be one of the easiest fixes in reducing farms’ impact on air pollution. Israel has made incredible technological advances and managed to reduce the overconsumption of water through drip irrigation, a system that delivers water and nutrients directly into the plant’s root through pipes. The technology is now being used in some African countries as well, thanks to funding from the World Bank. Lastly, countries like Australia have found ways to reduce agricultural methane emissions from farming by modifying the diets of livestock.

4. Introduce a Carbon Tax System

A carbon tax is an instrument of environmental cost internalisation, imposed on producers of raw fossil fuels based on the relative carbon content of those fuels. Governments usually set a fixed price that emitting companies must pay for each ton of greenhouse gas emissions they emit.

So far, 27 countries have implemented a carbon tax system as a way to incentivise polluters to lower emissions or switch to more efficient processes and cleaner fuels. At the same time, the carbon tax is a great way to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases generated from the same human activities and it is thus a good way to hit two birds with one stone.

5. Improving Air Quality While Fighting Climate Change

Last but not least, air pollution can be prevented by tackling climate change. These two phenomena are closely intertwined and neither can be seen exclusively as the cause or the effect. While deteriorating air quality is a consequence of climate change, air pollution also contributes to worsening global warming. That is why the climate crisis cannot be left out of the equation. Effective efforts to tackle climate change would significantly reduce deforestation and wildfires, two of the main sources of air pollution. Air quality and climate change are just one example of causes and effects overlapping. Therefore, the best shot for governments around the world to reduce air pollution is to implement broader policies that aim at tackling all aspects of the looming climate crisis.",,[],[]
Pollution and Heart Health,"Pollution is the contamination of the environment with harmful substances. The most common type of pollution is air pollution, which increases the risk of heart disease, lung disease, and cancer. However, not everyone is affected equally. Some regions and countries experience a higher burden of air pollution, and some conditions predispose individuals to more harmful effects from pollution.

This article discusses types of pollution and the effects of air pollution on cardiovascular health.

Types of Pollution

A pollutant is a substance or type of energy that contaminates the environment. Pollution can come from natural and manmade sources, and has effects on wildlife, climate, and human health.

Air Pollution

Air pollution is the most common type of pollution and occurs in both the indoor and outdoor air that we breathe. Air pollutants include chemicals like methane, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter (PM).

What Is Particulate Matter? PM includes carbon, sand, and dust particles, and ultrafine particles. PM is specified by particle size, with smaller size being even more dangerous to a person's health. For example, PM 2.5 denotes particles of up to 2.5 micrometers, which can be inhaled through breathing and cause health problems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has specified Air Pollution Guidelines for the various air pollutants, and governments can enact policies to help reduce sources of air pollution.

Sources of outdoor air pollution include:

Burning of fossil fuels (oil, coal, and gas for transportation and electricity)

Trash incineration

Wildfires

Sandstorms

Volcanic eruptions



Water Pollution

Water pollution harms the ocean ecosystem, causes acid rain, and affects drinking water. Pollutants in the water come from various sources, including:

Chemical runoff from fertilizer and pesticides

Sewage

Oil spills

Volcanic eruption

Animal waste

Algae

Ingesting water contaminated with arsenic, for example, has been linked to heart disease.



Land Pollution

Land pollution includes pollution of soil and land areas with contaminants. Mining products, chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides, and waste disposal contribute to land pollution.

Heavy metals like arsenic, lead, and cadmium have been associated with heart disease. These elements are found naturally in soil, but can also be introduced through fertilizers, pesticides, and contaminated water.

Radioactive Pollution

Radioactive materials can be found naturally, or they can enter the environment through:

Mining of radioactive elements

Power generation from nuclear power plants

Radioactive waste disposal

Nuclear weapons development

Significant radiation exposure has been linked to cancer.

Light Pollution

Light pollution is due to the use of artificial light sources in times of natural darkness.

Light pollution directly affects animal migration and habitats. It has been associated with disturbance of sleep patterns and increased stress in humans, both of which contribute to inflammation and heart disease.

Noise Pollution

Even noise pollution has been shown to have negative health effects. Traffic noise has been shown to affect sleep and stress hormone levels, and increase the risk of heart disease.



Pollution Exposure and Mortality The World Health Organization estimates that 99% of people on earth are exposed to air that exceeds recommended levels of pollution. Air pollution is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Globally in 2019, pollution was responsible for 9 million deaths, almost 62% of which were due to cardiovascular disease.

Air Pollution and Risk of Heart Disease

Studies have demonstrated a direct link between air pollution and cardiovascular disease and mortality.

Air pollution appears to have nearly the same risk as smoking on heart health. There is also some evidence that air pollution may increase high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attacks, and heart failure.

Short and Long-Term Effects According to a 2018 review: Short-term exposure to fine particle air pollution can increase the risk of cardiovascular events by 1%-3%.

Longer-term exposure increases the risk of heart disease by about 10% through its effects on blood sugar and blood pressure.

Who Is Affected?

Air pollution does not affect populations equally. Some parts of the world are exposed to higher levels of air pollution.

According to 2021 data from the World Health Organization, the Southeast Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions are among those with the highest PM pollution. Furthermore, in the United States, some racial and ethnic groups, people living in poverty, and people living in urban areas experience higher levels of air pollution.

Adults over 65 years old, infants, and those with underlying lung disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have increased risk from exposure to air pollution.



What Can Be Done About Air Pollution Exposure?

When PM levels are high, it can cause symptoms like itchy or watery eyes, throat irritation and coughing, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort. Those with underlying heart and lung conditions have an increased risk for complications.

Ways to decrease indoor air pollution include:

Changing HVAC filters frequently

Obtaining annual inspections of heating and cooling appliances and repairing any leaks promptly

Using exhaust fans when cooking

Using appropriate wood in wood-burning fireplaces and stoves

Not allowing cigarette smoking in the home

Outdoor pollution is out of our direct control, but when PM levels are high, the following measures can be taken:

Stay indoors and keep windows and doors shut

Avoid exercising outdoors

Use air purifiers

Wear properly fitted N-95 or P-100 respirator masks when outdoors



When driving, ensure that the air condition setting is using recirculate mode

In extreme cases when the air quality index indicates hazardous levels, you may be asked to evacuate the area.

In addition, you can decrease your footprint and avoid adding to already high levels air pollution by not burning things like fireplace wood, garbage and leaves, not using gas-powered lawn equipment, and minimizing car trips.

On a larger scale, policy changes can be enacted to help regulate air pollution.



Heart Disease Prevention

While the measures above can be taken during periods of high air pollution to help counteract its negative effects, there are general measures you can take to keep your heart as healthy as possible, regardless of pollution exposure.

Lifestyle changes like exercising and healthy diet are the cornerstones of preventing heart disease. It's not recommended to exercise outdoors during periods of high air pollution, but leading an active lifestyle has immense benefits for the heart.

A healthy diet includes:

Eating lots of fruits and vegetables, beans, and legumes

Avoiding processed meats (choose lean cuts and fish as protein sources)

Avoiding sugar sweetened beverages

Avoiding foods high in salt and sugar

Knowing your risk of heart disease is important. Getting your cholesterol checked and having your heart disease risk calculated with the Atherosclerotic Risk Assessment calculator can determine whether you can benefit from medication. If you have elevated risk, statins can help lower your risk of heart attack and stroke.

Summary

Environmental pollution, and air pollution in particular, has been linked to heart disease. People living in certain geographic and regional locations and those with underlying conditions tend to be more affected by air pollution. Steps can be taken to prevent indoor air pollution exposure, and everyone should try to implement healthy habits to prevent heart disease.

A Word From Verywell

Even though it's not always visible, air pollution can have negative effects on your health. It's important to take measures to protect yourself from air pollution and maintain healthy practices for heart health. Knowing your risk for heart disease is a great first step.",,[],"['Angela Ryan Lee', 'Learn About Our', 'Editorial Process', 'Medical Expert Board']"
Mopping can create air pollution that rivals city streets,"Cleanliness may be next to godliness, but a new study suggests it could have an unexpected downside: A few minutes of mopping indoors with a fresh-scented cleaning product can generate as many airborne particles as vehicles on a busy city street. The finding suggests custodians and professional cleaners may be at risk of health effects from frequent exposure to these suspended tiny particles, known as aerosols.

“I was absolutely amazed that mopping produced potentially harmful aerosols at similar rates to those generated by traffic on a busy street,” says Nicola Carslaw of the University of York who investigates indoor air pollution but was not involved with the study. “The people who should be paying particular attention to this paper are NIOSH, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,” adds Glenn Morrison, an environmental scientist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who was also not involved. “There is a lot of particle formation during these cleaning events, even under conditions that we would consider very normal.”

The air in homes, schools, and offices can sometimes be dirtier than the air outdoors, even in cities with pollution problems. Any kind of burning—candles, incense, cigarettes—is bad. Gas stoves and cooking food also spew unhealthy particles into the air, which can cause asthma and other health problems when breathed in. Other significant sources of indoor air pollution include personal care and cleaning products, whose fragrances contain volatile organic chemicals that react with ozone in the air to form small particles known as aerosols.

One molecule of concern is limonene, which is commonly added to cleaners and furniture polish to help remove oil and grease. The lemon-scented molecule reacts readily with ozone, an outdoor pollutant that is the main ingredient in smog. When ozone wafts into buildings, it reacts with limonene and similar molecules called monoterpenes, turning them into peroxides, alcohols, and other molecules that grow into airborne particles. Small particles can lodge deep in the lungs, irritating cells and—at high enough exposure—leading to health problems, such as asthma. In vulnerable people, particulate air pollution can cause heart attacks and strokes.

Previous studies found cleaning products can generate such pollution. But not all of these experiments were realistic or detailed. The new study was designed to reveal, minute by minute, what happens with airborne reactions during a typical floor cleaning. Researchers brought their lab instruments into a room with an air volume of 50 cubic meters, about half the size of a semitrailer container. In the morning, they mopped the floor for 12 to 14 minutes with a terpene-based cleaner. Then, they used state-of-the-art instruments to monitor the molecules and particles as they reacted over the next 90 minutes. “This is the first study that really looked at the entire chemical process under realistic indoor conditions,” says co-author Philip Stevens, an atmospheric chemist at Indiana University, Bloomington.

After the researchers collected data from the room, they calculated how many particles smaller than half a micron a person there would inhale during mopping. Using a standard computer model, the team reports today in Science Advances that an average person would breathe in about 1 billion to 10 billion nanoparticles each minute. That’s equivalent to vehicle traffic on a busy street in a typical U.S. or European city. It’s also about the same as cooking with a gas stove or lighting a candle.

The researchers also detected short-lived molecules called radicals, like hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl, that are known to drive reactions that create particles outdoors. But the new research shows they can also form indoors, from reactions between monoterpenes and ozone. “The rate at which it occurs indoors is surprising,” says co-author Colleen Rosales, a postdoc at the University of California, Davis. Carslaw adds that this “really important finding” should raise concerns about indoor air quality.

What about opening windows? The ventilation in the laboratory, similar to a typical office building, was not powerful enough to remove the particles. Ventilation can also be a double-edged sword, researchers say. It removes particles, but it can also bring in more dangerous ozone from outdoors.

Keeping ozone levels below one part per billion—either by reducing ventilation or using activated carbon air filters—would help reduce particle formation, the researchers say. So would cleaning in the morning or evening, when ozone levels tend to be lower, and avoiding products with limonene or other kinds of terpenes. Portable air filters can also reduce the concentration of particles inside rooms, says co-author Brandon Boor, a civil engineer at Purdue University.

Fortunately, time also helps: In the hours after cleaning, the newly formed particles grow in size, after which they settle out of the air. While resting on surfaces, the particles are harmless.

The larger problem, Boor says, is the scarcity of regulations for the design and operation of buildings—and the use of various common chemicals inside them—with respect to air quality. “We need to pay closer attention to what’s going on in indoor environments.”",,[],['Erik Stokstad']
