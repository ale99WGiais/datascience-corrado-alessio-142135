Dutch CO2 emissions down 11%; Aviation emissions rising,"Dutch emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses were about 11 percent lower in the first quarter of this year than in the same period last year. Statistics Netherlands (CBS) and the RIVM calculated that emissions decreased in most sectors, except for aviation and international shipping. If these two sectors and emissions from biomass-firing are included, emissions decreased by 9.9 percent.

In aviation, emissions rose by a massive 49 percent compared to the first quarter of 2021. Airlines are flying more again after a deep dip during the coronavirus pandemic.

The transport sector as a whole emitted 13.5 percent more carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase is offset by decreased emissions from the electricity sector, industry, agriculture, and the built environment. The main reason for the decrease is lower natural gas consumption.

The high natural gas prices played a role, but the first quarter of 2022 was also relatively warmer than the same quarter in 2021. ""The latter mainly has a dampening effect on the natural gas consumption in the built-up environment."" This category includes homes and offices. High energy prices also lowered consumption, according to CBS.

More and more electricity is generated from sustainable sources like the sun and wind. But more coal was burned at the beginning of this year. Overall emissions from electricity production fell by 14 percent.

The Netherlands also used more petrol (plus 4 percent) and diesel (plus 8 percent) in the first quarter of this year than in the first three months of 2021. But the total emissions from mobility are still lower than before the pandemic.

CBS pointed out that the economy has grown strongly. The gross domestic product increased by 7 percent compared to the first quarter of last year. Therefore, economic growth and more CO2 emissions do not have to go hand in hand. “Production was significantly higher for almost all sectors of the economy, while CO2 emissions were lower,” CBS summarized.",,[],[]
First study to measure total methane and CO2 emissions from liquefied natural gas carriers,"Graphical abstract. Credit: Environmental Science & Technology (2022). DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.2c01383

The results of a first-of-its-kind study to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers were released today, providing actionable data for the LNG shipping industry on methane emissions. The study, led by Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), helps improve the understanding of GHG emission profiles of LNG carriers to meet national and international climate targets and corporate climate strategies.

In 2021, a team of researchers from Queen Mary and SLR Consultants took direct measurements onboard the Cheniere-chartered GasLog Galveston for a roundtrip voyage from Cheniere's Corpus Christi liquefaction facility to a discharge port in Europe. The research covered all sources of methane and CO 2 emissions, including engine exhausts, venting and fugitive emissions. The study also sheds light on the best methods to directly measure methane emissions from LNG carriers, for future studies or retrofitting on-board continuous emissions monitors.

The results and recommendations were published today following peer-review in the journal Environmental Science and Technology (American Chemical Society) and include:

CO 2 emissions were lower than other studies have assumed, while venting and fugitive emissions of methane were also extremely low.

emissions were lower than other studies have assumed, while venting and fugitive emissions of methane were also extremely low. Uncombusted methane emissions from engine exhaust were in line with manufacturers' test data, but higher than other studies due to higher methane slip from the generator (non-propulsion) engines.

These engine methane slip emissions can be reduced drastically (as much as by half) by operating the engines at higher loads. The study notes that this was the Galveston's second voyage, and multiple engines were used at lower loads for operational reasons, and that carriers often utilize engines at higher loads.

The study recommends installation of methane emissions monitors on engine exhausts to monitor and report more accurate methane emissions estimates and to support methane mitigation operational practices.

Dr. Paul Balcombe, the Principal Investigator and lecturer in Chemical Engineering and Renewable Energy from Queen Mary University of London, said: ""This study helps to fill a big data gap when it comes to methane emissions from LNG shipping. It's vital that we understand what their emissions profile is at a time when LNG imports are likely to grow substantially to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian gas.

""This study is the first-of-a-kind to measure total methane emissions from engines aboard LNG carriers, including venting and fugitive emissions, but we need to do much more to get a representative sample of the approximately 600-strong LNG fleet. As well as these academic measurement studies, increased monitoring of emissions from engines, vents and fugitives would allow us to identify and implement effective reduction measures as hotspots are found.""

Fiji George, Cheniere's Senior Director for Climate and Sustainability, said: ""This study provides actionable recommendations to monitor and reduce LNG shipping emissions to further strengthen the climate benefits of LNG. Following the recommendations by the study, Cheniere is expanding our emissions monitoring on the majority of our chartered carriers to further put this science into action. We appreciate the work done by CAMS, QMUL and GasLog to help deliver data-driven transparency that can guide mitigation strategies.""

Kostas Karathanos, Gaslog's COO said: ""Gaslog is committed to support climate action and is investing in partnerships, research and development to achieve this. GHG and air emissions reduction is a priority for us, as reflected in our ESG focus areas; we therefore enthusiastically joined this initiative aiming to better understand and monitor methane emissions from LNG carriers. The industry needs similar studies to gather concrete data and establish confidence in the operational emissions. This is essential in determining impactful mitigating measures and pursue realistic reduction targets.""

What if CO2 emissions stopped today? A study offers answers,"Over the years, scientists have raised a key question about future climate change: When, exactly, does the warming stop?

Do temperatures stop rising as soon as people cease emitting greenhouse gases? Or is some level of future warming already guaranteed, or “locked in,” by our past emissions?

Recent studies generally suggest good news on that front. The vast majority of future warming depends on future emissions. There shouldn’t be much future warming locked in from the past.

Now, a new study suggests that’s mostly true — but with some caveats. It’s important to look at all kinds of human emissions in the atmosphere, the research suggests, not just the main greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.

When accounting for all of them, there may be a brief give-and-take before global temperatures finally stabilize. Global temperatures could continue to rise for a few years, or a few decades, after all emissions stop, and then they may fall back down again as the climate system stabilizes.

That means past a certain point, the world may not be able to avoid temporarily overshooting the Paris Agreement’s temperature targets.

In fact, the study suggests that even if all emissions halted today, the planet would still have around a 42 percent chance of overshooting the target of 1.5 degrees Celsius, even if temperatures later dropped back below it.

Still, the study emphasizes, it remains true that the vast majority of future warming depends on future emissions. And the faster those emissions spiral down to zero, the less warming there will be.

The study, released yesterday in the journal Nature Climate Change, used a specialized model to investigate how the Earth’s climate system would respond if emissions were to suddenly stop.

The study looked at a range of possible future climate scenarios assuming different levels of emissions, some higher, some lower. For each possible scenario, the researchers examined a series of hypothetical stop dates — the point at which emissions suddenly vanish — between now and 2080.

The study makes a point of accounting for a wide variety of different human-caused emissions, not just the heavy hitters like carbon dioxide and methane.

That’s important, the authors say, because some kinds of emissions actually have a cooling effect on the planet — and as a result, they’re masking a small portion of the warming that’s being caused by greenhouse gases. That means when these emissions vanish, this masking effect will also stop, and temperatures may temporarily rise beyond what might be expected when considering greenhouse gases alone.

Certain types of air pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels are a prime example. Some of these particles are highly reflective and help beam sunlight away from the Earth, slightly cooling the climate. If the planet stops burning fossil fuels, some of these pollutants will also disappear, taking their small masking effect with them.

In the short term, the researchers suggest, this means that global temperatures may actually rise slightly for a few years after all emissions halt. If emissions suddenly stopped today, for instance, the study suggests that the planet may continue to warm by a few tenths of a degree for several years.

Later, some of this effect is likely to reverse itself. Temperatures may begin to fall again as certain types of potent but short-lived greenhouse gases — like methane — begin to disappear from the atmosphere over time.

That’s where the concept of overshoot comes in.

The study finds that there’s a 42 percent chance of overshooting the 1.5 C target even if emissions stopped today. At the same time, there are much lower odds of the Earth’s final temperature stabilizing above 1.5 C — probably around 5 percent or so.

And the 2 C target still remains firmly in reach at this point. The study estimates only about a 2 percent chance of overshoot if emissions halted immediately, and zero odds that the Earth’s stable temperature would exceed 2 C in the long run.

Far more important to the fate of the planet, the study says, is what happens in the next few years.

The risk of overshoot rises substantially the longer humans continue emitting greenhouse gases. The study estimates that the risk of exceeding the 1.5 C target rises to 66 percent by 2029, assuming moderate emissions over the next few years.

And the risk of permanently overshooting the temperature targets also rises dramatically the longer emissions are released.

The research has a few important caveats. On one hand, it assumes that human-caused emissions suddenly stop all at once. That’s not how it would work in the real world, and changes in the Earth’s temperatures may be different in real life.

On the other hand, the study doesn’t account for certain kinds of potential climate feedbacks that could speed up future warming — things like thawing permafrost and rapid ice loss. That means that some of its estimates of future warming could be on the conservative side.

The study’s general warning, however, is clear. And it echoes the warnings issued in the newest reports from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Meeting the Paris targets is only possible with immediate and dramatic reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. And even then, the 1.5 C target is rapidly closing in.

The latest IPCC reports also warn the world not to underestimate the dangers of overshooting global temperature goals. Even if they later stabilize below 1.5 or 2 C, some climate impacts can’t be so easily reversed. Certain types of damage to glaciers and ice sheets, global sea-level rise, and the extinction of plant and animal species, for instance, are essentially permanent on human time scales.

At the same time, multiple recent studies have warned that current global climate policies are still not enough to put the world on track to meet the Paris climate goals.

“Our findings make it all the more pressing that we need to rapidly reduce emissions,” Michelle Dvorak, lead study author and a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, said in a statement.",,[],['Chelsea Harvey']
How much can e-bikes reduce carbon emissions?,"E-bikes could take the place of enough car trips to cut transportation emissions in England by as much as 24.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to a new study. What’s more, the greatest per capita benefits of e-bikes—with the potential to shave more than 750 kilograms of carbon dioxide off a person’s annual carbon footprint—are seen in rural and exburban areas.

Most schemes to decarbonize transport focus on electrifying passenger cars and light trucks. But studies have begun to show that this can’t be accomplished on the scale needed in time to meet decarbonization goals. In other words, we need to reduce car use, not just electrify cars.

E-bikes, bicycles equipped with a small electric motor to boost pedaling power, are of growing interest as an alternative to cars because they enable more people to cycle farther in more challenging terrain than would be possible with a conventional bicycle.

In the new study, researchers from the University of Leeds in the UK set out to calculate the maximum potential for e-bikes to replace car use throughout the whole of England. Their analysis takes into account car trip habits, demographic variables such as age and fitness levels, and hilliness of terrain for more than 32,000 neighborhoods in England, each with a population of 1,000 to 3,000 people.

The researchers calculated the proportion of people’s car travel in each neighborhood that could be substituted by e-bike travel, then calculated the carbon emissions savings that would be associated with the e-bike switch.

Maximizing e-bike use could save a total of 24.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year with an average savings of 580 kilograms per person, the researchers report in the journal Transport Policy.

In contrast, maximizing conventional bicycle use would save just 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, they calculated. “Because bicycles do not have the power assistance of the e-bike motor, the distance a person can travel on a bicycle is less than the distance they can travel on an e-bike,” the researchers write. That is, e-bikes can take the place of more car trips than bicycles can.

In rural and exurban areas, e-bike use could save a total of 7.1 million metric tons of carbon emissions per year. That’s greater than the 6.5 million metric tons that could be saved in major metropolitan areas—despite rural areas having only half the total population of major metros.

The findings echo those of studies elsewhere in Europe showing that e-bikes have the greatest carbon-cutting potential in relatively sparsely populated areas. But the new study is the first to provide such a fine-grained assessment of e-bike potential over such a wide geographic area.

Per-capita reductions from e-bike use are greatest for rural residents because people in rural areas drive more kilometers per year than those in urban areas, have less access to public transport, and make longer trips—many of which are too long to be made by conventional bicycle or walking.

The results suggest “that e-bike promotion policies would be more effective in rural areas to achieve the goal of carbon reduction,” the researchers write. Yet micromobility service providers, e-bike promotion schemes, and funding for active transport have tended to focus on big cities. “The implication is that there is a large untapped potential for e-bike use in rural and periurban areas,” they add.

The researchers also identified more than 3,400 neighborhoods where people are vulnerable to economic stress from the financial pressure of car ownership and that simultaneously have high e-bike potential. Focusing e-bike promotion policies on these areas could reduce carbon emissions and economic stress at the same time.

While the researchers set out to calculate the maximum reduction in carbon emissions that e-bikes could achieve in theory, actually bringing those savings about in practice will require a major policy push, including construction of long-distance cycling paths that link together cities, towns, and suburbs, e-bike charging stations at workplaces, and other cycling infrastructure.

Analysis: China’s CO2 emissions see longest sustained drop in a decade,"Lauri Myllyvirta , analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air covering air quality and energy trends in China.

China’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fell by an estimated 1.4% in the first three months of 2022, making it the third quarter in a row of falling emissions.

The new analysis for Carbon Brief, based on official figures and commercial data, shows that the three consecutive quarters, when seen together, represent the longest emissions decline in China for at least a decade.

Emissions peaked in summer 2021, as the government tightened policies on real estate to mitigate speculation and financial risk, before starting to fall in the third quarter last year. The fall in late 2021 and early 2022 was driven by the continued real estate slowdown and strong increases in clean energy. Starting from late March – at the very end of the period covered by this analysis – the main driver has become harsh Covid-19 control policies.

Furthermore, the second quarter of 2022 appears highly likely to extend the trend of falling emissions – even as the construction sector slowdown bottoms out – due to the impact of Covid lockdowns becoming much more pronounced.

In April, thermal power generation fell by the most since December 2015, the fall in cement output accelerated and apparent consumption of refined oil fell by almost as much as during the first Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020.

This analysis is the latest in a series of quarterly Carbon Brief updates, with the previous one having reported on the quarterly fall in China’s emissions in the third quarter of 2021.

Longest fall

China has previously seen only two periods of stable or falling CO2 emissions in the past decade. First, during the construction and industrial slowdown of 2013-16, emissions growth halted for three years, with quarterly growth rates alternating between positive and negative.

Then, in the first quarter of 2020, the initial nationwide Covid-19 lockdowns resulted in a steep – but short-lived – drop in emissions.

After the lockdown ended in April 2020, the government responded to the negative economic shock with policies designed to boost construction, exports and industrial output, resulting in a highly energy- and carbon-intensive recovery seen in the chart below.

Emissions first exceeded their pre-Covid-19 level in the second quarter of 2020, but growth soon cooled. The string of three consecutive quarters of falling emissions – starting in the third quarter of 2021 – is the longest in at least a decade.

The construction slowdown that explains much of the decline in the last few quarters was showing signs of bottoming out in the period to March, with the fall in steel output moderating to 5% year-on-year. This was also expected given the government’s emphasis on speeding up infrastructure and construction projects.

Nevertheless, the second quarter of 2022 still appears highly likely to extend the trend of falling emissions. In April, the economic fallout from the new round of Covid-19 lockdowns became much more pronounced, becoming the main driver of falling emissions.

Drivers of falling emissions

The largest contributor to the fall in CO2 emissions in the first quarter of this year was the cement industry, where output fell 12%, followed by the power and steel industries.

Another contributing factor was the drop in oil consumption, where the effect of Covid-19 control measures was already apparent.

These contributions can be seen in the chart, below, which shows year-on-year changes in quarterly CO2 emissions in China, broken down by sector for coal and cement (lower bars), and by fuel for oil and gas (top bar).

Chart by Joe Goodman for Carbon Brief using Highcharts

Steel and cement are China’s second and third largest emitting sectors, and the demand for both sectors is largely driven by construction activity, which has been contracting since summer 2021 due to the tighter policies on real estate lending and debt.

While output fell in both sectors, analysis of official data for April started to show diverging trends. Steel output fell by 5% year-on-year in April, much less than in previous months, indicating that output is bottoming out. Pig iron output was at the same level as a year ago, the first non-negative reading in almost a year.

To counteract the real estate slowdown and make it possible to reach GDP targets, the government has been promoting infrastructure investment, which requires a lot of cement, and also quite a lot of steel.

Yet cement output fell a massive 19% year-on-year in April, even more than in previous months. One possible explanation is that in new construction projects, steel is required before cement, to build the reinforcement. Both sectors were affected by falling investment in real estate construction, which saw a 3% reduction year-on-year. Additionally, the steel demand recovery was partially supported by the manufacturing industry.

In the power sector, thermal power generation increased 1% year-on-year in the first quarter, but improved power plant thermal efficiency and fuel switching still resulted in a drop in coal consumption.

The economic statistics for April report a steep drop in thermal power generation: output from thermal power plants fell 12% year-on-year. This is the largest reduction since December 2015, eclipsing the drop seen during the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown even though electricity demand fell more at that time.

The sharp reduction in thermal power output this April was due to a combination of weak demand – down 4% year-on-year – combined with strong growth of clean energy.

Half of the reduction was due to lower electricity demand, one quarter was due to strong growth in wind and solar output, and one quarter due to good hydropower operating conditions. Power generation from wind and solar increased 15% and 25% year-on-year respectively, while hydropower output jumped 17%.

Wind, solar and nuclear combined will almost certainly overtake hydropower for total generation this year, which is remarkable given the size of China’s hydropower industry.

This development is also positive for the growth of China’s clean energy output overall, as these technologies have very large growth potential, whereas the potential for hydropower expansion has largely been exhausted, as seen in the limited increase projected in long-term energy scenarios for China.

Major push for more coal mines, power plants and blast furnaces

Even as China’s coal demand is falling, the output from domestic coal mines is increasing rapidly. This resulted in a major overall drop in coal imports in the first quarter of the year, as reported by China Customs, and allowed coal plants and other operators to fill up stockpiles that were depleted during last year’s coal shortage.

Investment in new coal- and gas-fired power capacity is also continuing at a high level. In the first four months of the year, at least 18 thermal power projects started construction, with a total capacity of 12.8 gigawatts (GW). Another 19 projects with a total capacity of 13.0GW were approved for construction.

​​Investment in new steel capacity also stayed at a high level. From January to May 2022, 28m tonnes of new coal-based (blast furnace) iron-making capacity was approved, according to CREA’s compilation of new announcements.

These projects will replace older blast furnaces with brand-new capacity, with a long expected life. This makes the sector ill-equipped to adjust to a reduction in demand for pig iron, as steel demand growth slows down and more steel is produced from scrap instead of pig iron. The amount of new capacity approved corresponds to rebuilding 5% of the existing blast furnace capacity every year.

In steelmaking, our mapping shows new investments have shifted towards electric steelmaking. For the first time, approved new electric arc furnace capacity overtook basic oxygen furnace capacity.

The government is aiming to boost infrastructure and other construction, again, this year to hit GDP targets, or at least shrink the shortfall. This could result in an increase in coal demand towards the second half of the year, but the data to date suggests little sign of this so far.

One reason for the push for more coal output and coal power plants is that the 2021 coal shortage, and the resulting power rationing, were clearly something China’s central planners want to avoid at any cost.

This has prompted the “all-of-the-above” expansion of coal mining, coal-fired power and clean energy, to ensure similar shortages are avoided. The energy security drive has meant that measures to avoid overcapacity, such as the coal power traffic lights system and coal power capacity control targets have not been published, and the closure of older coal power plants has been put on hold. The planners appear prepared to accept the risk of building too much capacity, even if it ends up under-utilised and risks financial losses.

Avoiding any electricity shortages is all the more important because of the political importance of this year – the twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress that selects the party’s new leaders is scheduled for later in 2022.

Furthermore, the Chinese government is currently pushing for all kinds of infrastructure and construction projects to offset the effect of the real estate slump and Covid lockdowns on other parts of the economy. Coal mines, power plants and blast furnaces are just some of the recipients of this government backing.

The support for construction projects is also benefiting low-carbon technologies. Solar PV installations increased 140% year-on-year in the first four months of 2022 and wind installations by 45%. As approximately 103GW of wind and solar was installed last year, the early part of 2022 puts it on track for another world record in terms of annual growth.

Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing continues to skyrocket. Output more than doubled, again, in January-April compared with one year ago, while overall auto production fell. EVs made up a record 21% of all vehicles produced.

Will emissions rebound?

The sharply fluctuating energy trends and economic policies make it difficult to predict energy demand growth in China in the months and years ahead.

The previous episodes of falling emissions in China have been followed by rebounds. After the 2007 financial crisis, the government launched an unprecedented stimulus programme, leading to even faster emissions growth than before the crisis.

The 2013–16 slowdown was followed by a more gradual rebound – and after the Covid-19 lockdown, emissions surged far above pre-Covid levels, as seen in the chart below.

Annualised CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and cement broken down by sector and fuel, million of tonnes. Emissions are estimated from National Bureau of Statistics data on production of different fuels and cement, China Customs data on imports and exports and WIND Information data on changes in inventories, applying IPCC default emissions factors and annual emissions factors per tonne of cement production until 2019. Monthly values are scaled to annual data on fuel consumption in annual Statistical Communiques and National Bureau of Statistics annual Yearbooks. Chart by Joe Goodman for Carbon Brief using Highcharts

Stimulating construction, rather than incomes and consumption, is a long-running feature of China’s response to negative economic shocks. This results in periods of carbon-intensive growth, as producing steel and cement for construction is far more emissions-intensive than producing consumer goods and services.

Since late 2021, the government has sought to increase and speed up infrastructure and other construction projects, following the same pattern.

Whether the current fall in emissions results in another rebound depends mainly on three factors: how large is the infrastructure construction programme this time; will the real estate sector inflate again; and how fast does clean energy investment grow.

An indiscriminate wave of stimulus projects would go against the government’s aims of achieving “high-quality growth“, as well as on avoiding debt and financial risks.

There is also a practical question of how large an investment programme local governments are willing and able to underwrite, given their already high debt levels and the significant damage to their finances from the contraction in real estate and land sales.

Real estate has continued to contract. In April, government figures show the floor space of newly started buildings fell to the lowest level since 2015.

The central bank and many local governments have taken steps this year to support real estate, including by easing mortgage conditions. In 2020, the money people did not consume found its way to real estate, resulting in a major increase in steel demand and emissions in late 2020 and early 2021.

In 2022, the drop-off in real estate sales has been even deeper than during the initial lockdowns in 2020, as lack of confidence and uncertainty over economic outlook have dampened appetite.

Even if energy demand growth rebounds to a moderate level due to the stimulus programme or a general economic recovery, the effect on emissions could be offset by rapid expansion of clean energy.

Central and local governments have set very ambitious targets for wind and solar power installations during the five-year period from 2021 to 2025. If fully realised, the planned clean energy expansion could cover all additional energy demand growth over the period, enabling coal consumption and emissions to peak before 2025.

Data sources

Data for the analysis was compiled from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, National Energy Administration of China, China Electricity Council and China Customs official data releases, and from WIND Information, an industry data provider.

When data was available from multiple sources, different sources were cross-referenced and official sources used when possible, adjusting data from WIND Information to match.

Ethos sets target to cut CO2 emissions with new climate strategy,"Ethos, the Swiss foundation for sustainable development, has set a target to reduce the CO 2 emissions in its investment funds – 91.5% by 2050 – as per its newly- published climate strategy for 2022-2050.

The carbon intensity will be reduced by 34.5% by 2025, by 56% by 2030, and by 78.1% by 2040, aligning its investment funds to a global warming path well below 2°C and as close as possible to 1.5°C by 2030 at the latest, it added.

Ethos’s climate targets – approved by the members of the foundation and its shareholders at its annual general meeting last week – apply to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of companies held in its equity investment funds (Swiss Sustainable Equities, Equities CH Indexed Corporate Governance, Vontobel Fund Equities Swiss Mid & Small, Clartan ESG Europe Small & Mid Cap, Equities Sustainable World), and from 2023 to the Ethos Swiss Bonds and Ethos Bonds International funds, the climate strategy stated.

The foundation is taking action to cut emissions coming largely from companies in its investment funds that should in the future rely on a climate strategy and take measures to decarbonise business activities.

Ethos said that figures will be adjusted once investee companies have published their data on GHG emissions for 2021 and the data will be available to investors. It will start to calculate emissions for the bond funds once the methodology is finalised, it added.

The carbon intensity of Ethos’s funds, calculated on the assets recorded in 2021, was 209 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2021, up from 201 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2020 and down from 322 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested, according to the climate strategy report.

Assets in the funds increased year-on-year from CHF1.03bn in 2019, to CHF1.50bn in 2020 and CHF2.05bn in 2021, the report added.

In particular, the carbon intensity in the Clartan ESG Europe Small & Mid Cap fund jumped from 442 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2020 to 1,996 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2021 because companies Nexans and Rexel were included in the fund, Ethos said.

The carbon intensity in the Vontobel Fund Equities Swiss Mid & Small also increased from 178 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2020 to 204 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2021.

The carbon intensity in the Swiss Sustainable Equities and Equities CH indexed Corporate Governance funds saw an uptick in 2021 to 171 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested and 241 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested, respectively.

In the fund Equities Sustainable World excluding Switzerland, instead, carbon intensity decreased from 465 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2020 to 364 tonnes of CO 2 per million invested in 2021.

Ethos has also set a target of 100% by 2040 of owned companies with science-based 1.5°C reduction targets validated by an independent organisation. Currently the Vontobel fund counts only 8% of such companies, the Clartan fund 28%, the Equities Sustainable World 36% the Equities CH indexed Corporate Governance 40%, and the Swiss Sustainable Equities fund 44%.

It will intensify the engagement with companies that do not have targets validated by an independent organisation and from 2025 it will exclude the companies in the fossil fuel sectors that have not set reduction targets for their emissions validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) or a similar organisation.

From this year Ethos will also oppose at AGMs to the re-election of chairs of sustainability committees, or board of directors if such a committee does not exist, of companies with high GHG emissions that do not have a convincing climate strategy or that have not set and validated reduction targets for their GHG emissions.

It will extend this policy to all companies from 2025.

Climate action on CO2 emissions alone won’t prevent extreme warming - study,"Steam rises from the cooling towers of the coal power plant of RWE, one of Europe's biggest electricity and gas companies in Niederaussem, Germany, March 3, 2016. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay

May 23 (Reuters) - To control climate change, the world must go beyond cutting carbon dioxide emissions and curb lesser-known pollutants such as nitrous oxide playing a key role in warming the planet, new research suggests.

Decades of global climate discussions have focused on CO2 emissions, which are most abundant in the atmosphere. The common goal of reaching ""net-zero"" emissions refers most often to CO2 emissions alone.

Over the last year, more than 100 countries have pledged a 30% cut by 2030 to emissions from methane, another carbon-based greenhouse gas that is far more powerful at trapping heat than CO2. Most of those countries have yet to say how they will meet that deadline.

Meanwhile, scant attention has been paid to other warming pollutants, including black carbon, also called soot, which absorbs radiative heat, as well as hydrofluorocarbons found in refrigerants, and nitrous oxides. But together with methane, these pollutants are responsible for about half of the warming seen today, according to the study published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

""When we're worried about the near-term … we need to look at the other non-CO2 climate forcers,"" said study co-author Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development in Washington DC.

This is especially important as countries pursue CO2 reductions through cutting back on their use of fossil fuels, still considered the main contributor to global warming. Using fewer fossil fuels will result in less air pollution, including airborne sulphates that actually counteract some climate change by reflecting solar radiation away from Earth.

Scientists say these sulphates are masking about 0.5 degree Celsius of warming that would be seen without them, meaning aggressive climate action could see temperatures temporarily jump higher – unless the lesser pollutants are tackled as well.

A path of decarbonization alone would see the planet breach 2 degrees Celsius of warming beyond pre-industrial temperatures by 2045, the study finds.

Conversely, reining in all climate pollutants together could see the world begin to avoid some warming as early as 2030 and halve the rate of warming between 2030 and 2050, the findings suggest.

""This landmark paper should bring about a major rethink"" of global targets, said Euan Nisbet, a climate scientist at Royal Holloway, University of London, not involved in the study. ""If we don't also bring down non-CO2 warming, we cook.""

Green recovery from Covid could greatly reduce CO2 emissions,"Although the Covid-19 pandemic had a highly disruptive effect on global health and economy, it also reduced carbon emissions in 2020 by six to seven percent. Many governments worldwide have now invested in recovery plans to stimulate the economy and support employment. However, these measures could affect emissions for years to come.

A new study led by the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency has argued that, if recovery packages would focus on accelerating the transition to low-carbon energy production and improving energy efficiency in industry, a long-lasting reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from energy production and industrial processes could be achieved. According to the experts, a one percent global GDP investment could reduce global CO2 emissions by six to 8.5 percent by the end of this decade.

“After successfully analyzing the results of the pandemic on global emissions in a previous modelling study, we thought it would be an interesting exercise to investigate the possible effects of a targeted economic recovery focused on ‘green’ measures and policies,” said study lead author Ioannis Dafnomilis, an expert in climate change mitigation at PBL.

“At that time, governments had announced numerous recovery measures, but the focus was mostly on economic recovery in general. To our knowledge, we are still the only scientific team to investigate a green recovery from Covid using a multi-model approach.”

By focusing on investments in areas that directly support emissions reduction in energy production and industrial processes, Dr. Dafnomilis and his colleagues have modelled an investment plan over three years. The analysis revealed that even a temporary stimulus package could potentially achieve long-lasting reductions of CO2 emissions by driving the low-carbon transition in the energy, transportation, and industry sectors.

“The share of renewables in total electricity generation is projected to increase, uptake of electric vehicles is accelerated, and energy savings in industry and building sectors lead to additional emission reductions. Our findings showcase the multiple benefits a green recovery stimulus can have, in terms of minimizing CO2 emissions from energy production and industry and upscaling low-carbon technologies,” said Dr. Dafnomilis.

However, the scientists stressed that an investment increase in low-carbon technologies of only three years is insufficient to change the trajectory of global emissions on its own. This investment should be combined with strong climate policies aiming to limit the production and consumption of fossil fuels. Moreover, the green recovery packages will need to be tailored for each specific country in order to maximize sustainability and socio-economic benefits.

The study is published in the journal Frontiers in Climate.

There’s more carbon dioxide in the air than ever before in human history,"Before the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels sat consistently at around 280 parts per million (ppm) for around 6,000 years. The human-friendly level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is estimated to be around 350 ppm, which was first breached in May 1986. But on May 2022, the CO 2 readings at NOAA’s Mauna Loa Baseline Observatory in Hawaii peaked at 421 ppm, up by around 1.8 ppm from last year.

That means two things: first that CO 2 levels in the atmosphere have skyrocketed around 50 percent since the late 19th century or so; and second, that they match the balmy conditions of the Pliocene Climatic Optimum, a prehistoric period between 4.1 and 4.5 million years ago when sabertooth cats and giant sloths ruled the planet. According to the American Society of Meteorology, during this time, sea levels were around 35 meters higher than they currently are, the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps all but melted, and southern Florida was fully underwater. The difference, however, is that these climatic changes happened over the course of millions of years instead of just a few decades.

“The science is irrefutable: Humans are altering our climate in ways that our economy and our infrastructure must adapt to,” National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement last week. “We can see the impacts of climate change around us every day. The relentless increase of carbon dioxide measured at Mauna Loa is a stark reminder that we need to take urgent, serious steps to become a more Climate Ready Nation.”

[Related: An ancient era of global warming could hint at our scorching future]

This data follows news from earlier this year that global CO 2 emissions in 2021 were the highest ever in history, up 6 percent from 2020 pandemic-lockdown measurements to around 36.3 billion tonnes. Coal accounted for around 40 percent of this jump with an all-time high of CO 2 emissions totaling 15.3 billion tonnes. At the same time, renewable energy set a new record in 2021 with 8,000 terawatt hours of electricity produced around the world.

“It’s depressing that we’ve lacked the collective willpower to slow the relentless rise in CO 2 ,” geochemist Ralph Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography said in the NOAA release. “Fossil fuel use may no longer be accelerating, but we are still racing at top speed toward a global catastrophe.”

The spike in carbon emissions has been even more noticeable in recent decades, especially since the 1950s, says Pieter Tans, senior scientist with NOAA’s Global Monitoring Laboratory. But a look at ice cores in Greenland or Antarctica with millions of years worth of climate data shows we’ve never experienced rates like this. Even as CO 2 concentrations have varied through Earth’s history, it’s “just since 1950, really, that we’ve seen [their] explosion in geologic time,” Tans explains.

Dave Keeling of the Scripps Institute in California was the first to record annual rises in CO 2 emissions in the planet’s atmosphere. In the first years of the Keeling Curve, which dates back to 1958, increases stood at about 0.7 ppm. Today, it shows increases of around 2.4 to 2.5 ppm year on year.

But the CO 2 jumps aren’t the end of it. The greenhouse gas pileup has multitude effects on the planet: rising sea levels, dangerous heat, and worsening flooding and droughts on all sides of the globe. Even if emissions were to drop suddenly, it would still take hundreds of years for the Keeling Curve to decline. The oceans and atmosphere would likely be filled with more carbon dioxide than normal for thousands of years into the future.

[Related: New satellites can pinpoint methane leaks to help us beat climate change]

That said, curbing greenhouse gas emissions remains just as important— and the solutions already exist. “It’s a political problem, not a scientific problem,” says Tans. While some countries are rapidly moving away from fossil fuels, giants like India have recently decided to reopen coal plants. Additionally, nations continue to pollute the air with another powerful greenhouse gas, methane; the largest emitters won’t even pledge to decrease their methane levels by 30 percent.

There’s no telling where the planet’s headed if emissions keep rising at the rates they’re at now. “It imperils humanity, because climate change of this nature really makes the Earth look like a different place in the near future,” Tans says. “Will it still be inhabitable? We actually don’t know. So we could be killing ourselves collectively.”",,[],"['Sara Kiley Watson', 'Sara Kiley Watson Is An Assistant Editor At Popular Science', 'Where She Has Led Sustainability Coverage Since She Started Her Tenure At Popsci As An Intern In Before Joining The Team Full Time As An Editorial Assistant In', 'Contact The Author']"
Mitsui Chemicals Partners with Mitsui-Soko Holdings to Calculate CO2 Emissions from International Transport of Products,"Mitsui Chemicals, Inc. 4183 President &,HASHIMOTO)) has worked in partnership with Mitsui-Soko Holdings Co., Ltd. 9302 President &,KOGA)) to develop a method of calculating CO 2 emissions resulting from international transport of its products over the last three years.

This method will enable Mitsui Chemicals to calculate and disclose virtually all CO 2 emissions at all stages from raw materials through to production and shipping. The method used to calculate emissions due to the shipment of products is notable for being a highly precise one whose validity has been verified by a third-party international organization.

Both companies will continue to work together to visualize CO 2 emissions in real time via a digital logistics platform provided by Mitsui-Soko Holdings.



Encompasses multimodal transport across the globe, including not only maritime and air shipping but also modes such as rail and road freight.



Enables high-precision calculation that takes into account such matters as regional differences in CO 2 emission coefficients – even when using the same mode of transport.



emission coefficients – even when using the same mode of transport. The calculation method provided by Mitsui-Soko Holdings has been assessed and verified as valid by third-party international organization DNV*1.

Mitsui Chemicals used the service for calculating CO 2 emissions from international transport offered as part of Mitsui-Soko Holdings' SustainaLink logistics sustainability support service. The calculation was carried out by analyzing tens of thousands of data points held by Mitsui Chemicals for each mode, product and sector.

The formula used to calculate emissions is based on a method that encompasses international transport and complies with the GLEC Framework. In April 2022, the formula became the first in Japan to be assessed and verified as valid by third-party organization DNV.

Mitsui-Soko Holdings intends to continue identifying CO 2 emissions from transport, visualizing the effects of reducing CO 2 emissions across the supply chains of Mitsui Chemicals and other clients, and proposing specific logistics solutions aimed at achieving actual reductions.

In November 2020, Mitsui Chemicals announced its commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In addition to giving consideration to the environment in the realm of production, Mitsui Chemicals will continue to undertake initiatives aimed at reducing the burden on the environment resulting from product shipment and delivery by visualizing transport volumes and CO 2 emissions.

Mitsui Chemicals' carbon neutral strategy is centered around the two pillars of (1) reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions throughout each supply chain and (2) maximizing the reductions in emissions accruing to products and services over their entire life cycle. Based on this strategy, Mitsui Chemicals will seek to create a sustainable society by stepping up a variety of efforts aimed at contributing to the transformation of society.

""Mitsui Chemicals has created a Purchasing Division, Logistics Division and a number of other divisions under the new Digital Transformation Sector established this past April and is shifting up a gear in its efforts to promote digital transformation throughout the company, including our supply chains,"" said SAMBE Masao, Chief Data Officer and Managing Executive Officer, Mitsui Chemicals. ""We're honored to have been able to calculate CO 2 emissions from international transport by Mitsui Chemicals using the service provided by Mitsui-Soko Holdings, which is the first in Japan to have had its validity assessed by a third-party organization.

""Mitsui Chemicals will help realize a sustainable society by leveraging digital transformation to visualize CO 2 emissions in real time and promoting reductions in the environmental burden resulting from product shipment and delivery.""

""Mitsui-Soko Holdings is proud to be able to implement this initiative in partnership with Mitsui Chemicals, which is one of Japan's leading general chemical manufacturers and is promoting efforts to reduce the burden on the environment from multifaceted perspectives,"" said KIRIYAMA Tomoaki, Senior Executive Officer, Mitsui-Soko Holdings. ""We'll be stepping up efforts to support initiatives by Mitsui Chemicals and our other clients to reduce environmental burdens arising from supply chains, proposing specific logistics solutions aimed at creating a sustainable society.""

Equilibrium/Sustainability — Distilling vodka from CO2 emissions,"A Brooklyn-based startup is on a mission to transform greenhouse gas emissions into luxury vodka, perfume and hand sanitizer.

“We work with partners that capture that carbon dioxide before it’s emitted into the atmosphere, and then we use that CO2 in our process in creating the alcohols,” Gregory Constantine, co-founder and CEO of Air Company, told CNBC.

Air Company’s vodka, called Air Vodka, is made of just two ingredients: carbon dioxide and water.

The process separates hydrogen out of the water through electrolysis, releasing oxygen, and then feeds the hydrogen into a system with captured carbon dioxide, according to CNBC. The end result is ethanol, which becomes a type of vodka when combined with water.

Air Vodka may cost $65 per bottle, but the company — whose operations are backed by investors like Toyota and JetBlue — is eyeing a variety of other products down the line, CNBC reported.

Today we’ll take a look at how climate change is worsening an existing maternal health crisis, as well as how the ongoing baby formula shortage is challenging American parents. Then we’ll look at the tension between Texas’s booming Bitcoin industry and its surging energy needs.





Climate change worsening maternal health crisis

Climate-driven environmental issues may be exacerbating an existing maternal health crisis across the U.S., Nexus Media News reported.

Pregnancy-aged Americans already face unique challenges, as the U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, according to Nexus, a nonprofit climate news site whose story also appeared in Ms. Magazine.

The U.S. had nearly 24 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020, the report stated, citing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics.

‘Every family for themselves’: Esther McCant, a Miami-based doula — a professional labor assistant — told Nexus that she has visited clients in sweltering apartments that lack air conditioning.

She also recalled helping a third trimester client flee a hurricane in 2017.

“There’s not really a lot of guidance for pregnant moms during those types of situations,” McCant said. “In general, it’s every family for themselves.”

A universal problem: It’s not just American women who are bearing unique effects of climate change.

“Women traditionally face barriers and obstacles in normal situations, but they are increased with extreme climate-fueled weather,” Chilean attorney Lorena Zenteno Villa told E&E News.

Latin American women have pursued several environmental damage lawsuits, including a Colombian case arguing that pesticide use raises the risk of miscarriage, Villa added.

Some women are worse off than others: In the U.S., Black women are about three times more likely to die while pregnant or shortly thereafter than white women — and are 50 percent more likely to give birth to premature or underweight babies, according to Nexus.

Hispanic and Indigenous individuals also tend to have worse pregnancy outcomes than their white peers, Nexus reported.

Extreme weather worsens those inequities: It “disproportionately affects Black and Brown women,” who are more likely to live in urban heat islands, work outdoors and breathe contaminated air, obstetrician-gynecologist Nathaniel DeNicola told Nexus.

DeNicola, who worked in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and now practices in wildfire-prone Southern California, said that such events tend to coincide with a rise in emergency visits for pregnant individuals.

Protecting moms and babies: Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.) co-sponsored a bill called the Protecting Moms and Babies Against Climate Change Act, which would fund research into the impacts of climate change on pregnancy while boosting postpartum access to Medicaid, Nexus reported.





A STRUGGLE TO NOURISH THE YOUNGEST AMERICANS

American parents are scrambling to find solutions to the baby formula supply shortage that has left supermarket shelves empty across the country.

Formula manufacturer Abbott Nutrition announced on Monday evening that it had reached an agreement with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the restart of operations at its Michigan plant, our colleague Nathaniel Weixel reported.

Why were they shut down? The FDA has been looking into whether powdered formula from the site caused four babies to contract a rare bacterial illness — ultimately leading to two deaths.

The shutdown added to disruptions in an already strained supply chain, forcing many parents to travel for hours to obtain formula, Weixel reported.

Response in Congress: House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) filed supplemental funding legislation on Tuesday to address the shortage, our colleague Aris Folley reported for The Hill.

The bill would provide $28 million in emergency funds to help ameliorate the current situation and prevent future such events.

Looking overseas: The FDA on Monday said it was encouraging overseas manufacturers to apply to ship their formulas to the U.S., The Wall Street Journal reported.

Nonetheless, it could be weeks before these products appear on U.S. store shelves, as the FDA will first need to conduct a quality assurance review, according to the Journal.

And if you can’t find formula in the meantime? Pediatricians told The Washington Post that there are several options, but stressed that some choices might not be right for every baby:

Switch to different or generic brands, unless the baby has milk protein allergies.

For babies over six months old, boost solid foods — aside from foods that are choking hazards or raw honey.

Use donor breast milk from reputable milk banks.

But absolutely never dilute formula or try to make homemade formula — as the former can harm infants’ kidneys and the latter can cause severe illness, the Post reported.





Amid emergency, Texas gets more Bitcoin miners

An energy-intensive Bitcoin mining operation is opening in Texas in the midst of an unseasonal heat wave that has put the state grid on emergency footing for nearly three weeks.

The announcement highlights the tension between three big drivers of electricity demand: The state’s booming cryptocurrency industry, its growing population and its rising temperatures.

Miners head West: On Tuesday cryptocurrency mining company Mawson Infrastructure announced the creation of a new facility that would allow it to run the complex computations that “mine” new Bitcoins, according to crypto trade site Coindesk.

Energetic demands: The facility will require about 120 megawatts of power, Yahoo Finance reported.

That’s enough to power about 24,000 houses on a hot day, according to data from The Houston Chronicle.

Dicey timing: The announcement comes just after a weekend in which the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Texas’s energy regulator, asked citizens to push their thermostats up to a sweaty 78 degrees to avoid crashing the state grid, The Texas Tribune reported.

Crypto crunch creates caution: ERCOT has been cautious about the impacts the state’s cryptocurrency industry could have on the grid.

To avoid overtaxing state electricity supplies, the regulator ruled in March that new Bitcoin facilities would have to seek “approval to energize” before beginning operations, The Dallas Morning News reported.

Miners seek alternatives: ERCOT’s announcement drove leading Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital to announce on an earnings call earlier this month that it would be considering diversifying out of Texas.

What about this deal? Mawson isn’t sure yet where it’s going to get that electricity — though the company has signed a deal with the-Wyoming-based firm JAI Energy, Coindesk reported.

JAI uses “wasted” methane (another name for excess natural gas from drilling sites) to power Bitcoin rigs — which are like server farms devoted to the computations that occasionally yield bitcoins, according to the company.

That’s a limited fix: While it could avoid directly straining the grid, wasted methane isn’t any different from or more renewable than normal methane — which is the same as what the state’s power plants burn, CNBC reported.

Methane reliance feeds the larger problem: The widespread use of methane for power is one of the biggest drivers of runaway global warming, according to a report released on Monday by the Environmental Defense Fund.

Takeaway: In addition to generating competition for both grid capacity and fuel, cryptocurrency’s reliance on methane for power is helping drive the need for more air conditioning — and therefore exacerbating the broader conflict over electricity supplies.







BETTER WIND FORECASTS SAVE CUSTOMERS MILLIONS

Wind energy customers saved $384 million over the last decade — thanks to advances in weather prediction technology, a new study has found.

The savings were enabled by updates to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s (NOAA) wind prediction algorithm, according to the study, published on Tuesday in the American Institute of Physics.

Knowing when to shut down: The advances allowed grid operators to better calibrate when to keep their turbines on, and when to shut them off and draw energy from other sources — saving customers money, according to NOAA.

A natural experiment: The agency’s scientists update their wind prediction model every few years. But they also leave the old one in place for a year to see how the two compare.

“We were able to compare these models, side by side, and see when one model makes a better prediction than the other,” author Martin Shields of Colorado State University said in a statement.

Better over time: “What we see over time is that the models get better at predicting wind, and that generates additional savings for utility consumers,” Shields added.

The surprising environmental cost of reusable rockets, a salve for Rivian’s investment blues and a hidden source of Big Tech’s carbon pollution.

Rockets pollute high above the earth

Reusable rocket technology by companies like SpaceX has enabled cheaper and more frequent space travel — but it has also injected massive amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide into the upper atmosphere, according to a new study published by the American Institute of Physics.

Ford unloads Rivian, but Amazon stays on

While Ford recently began to unload its shares of electric vehicle startup Rivian, Amazon’s support for the company remains strong, tech news site Tech Xplore reported, with the e-commerce giant ordering 100,000 electric delivery vans and buying 150 million shares in Rivian.

How tech companies hide their carbon footprints

Carbon reduction pledges at companies like PayPal and Google may be concealing a big gap: The companies are reportedly stashing their assets with banks that use their funds to make loans to new fossil fuel developments, according to Quartz.

This popular food is a major ‘under the radar’ cause of carbon emissions: study,"Cheese lovers won’t want to brie-lieve it.

Dairy cheese was found to be a top contributor of carbon emissions by a new study, revealing that quitting the real deal for plant-based could cut the cheese market’s climate impact in half.

Just one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of the most popular types of cheese at supermarkets — such as cheddar, mozzarella, feta and parmesan — produces the equivalent of between 6.5 and 12.8 kilograms of carbon dioxide, according to the study by sustainability consultancy Quantis. That’s the same as driving nearly seven miles in a car, South West News Service reported on Wednesday.

By comparison, the study authors found that a kilogram of vegan cheese — specifically one by the brand Violife — would yield 3.7 kilograms less.

The World Economic Forum has shown that dairy cheese trails just behind beef and lamb as the most prolific greenhouse gas generators among foods, ahead of chicken, pork and egg production.

‘There’s a clear desire for change in the US as shown in the survey result. That gives us hope we can drive the change.’ Sally Smith, director of sustainability at Upfield/Violife.

“The environmental impact of dairy often slips under the radar,” warned Sally Smith, director of sustainability at vegan food producer Upfield, which owns the Violife brand. She further suggested to SWNS that if a family of four switched from dairy cheese to a vegan alternative for a year, they could potentially “save the equivalent CO2 emissions as they would traveling 775 miles on an intercontinental flight.”

The findings coincide with a new poll that found more than half — 51% — reported having tried vegan cheese in the past, while only 15% said they don’t eat cheese at all.

Carbon dioxide generated by cheese producers is on par with products of the meat industry, according to World Economic Forum research. Getty Images/Image Source

“Those wanting to reduce their carbon footprint now have a wider range of delicious, natural plant-based alternatives than ever dairy and meat,” she added.

Fewer than a quarter of US adults — 23% — admitted they don’t understand how the food they eat and carbon emissions are linked, according to OnePoll. Meanwhile, only 35% of the 2,000 survey participants were even aware that dairy cheese had such a high carbon footprint.

Smith suggested there’s an “appetite” for more information — as the poll also found that 79% of adults confessed to feeling guilty about eating such carbon-intensive foods, and 75% agreed that greenhouse gas production in the food industry worries them.

“There’s a clear desire for change in the US as shown in the survey results,” Smith said. “That gives us hope we can drive the change.”",,[],['Social Links For Hannah Sparks']
Fact Check-Volcanoes do not produce more CO2 emissions than human activity,"An eruption of Italy’s Mt. Etna, Europe’s highest and most active volcano, does not produce “10,000 times” more carbon dioxide (CO2) than “mankind has in our entire time on earth”. Contrary to a years-old meme containing this false statement, the combined activity of all volcanoes on earth is actually estimated to be a fraction of the CO2 emitted by human activity.

The meme reads: “That one little burp by Mt. Etna has already put more than 10,000 times the CO2 into the atmosphere than mankind has in our ENTIRE time on earth but don’t worry a scam is in the works to tax you your minuscule footprint.”

The same allegation has been shared since at least 2016 ( here ) ( here ). More recent examples are viewable ( here ) ( here ) ( here ).

An iteration posted on Twitter on June 2, 2022 has been retweeted nearly 9,000 times as of the writing of this article ( here ).

In an email to Reuters, Boris Behncke, vulcanologist at the Etna Observatory of Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) ( here ) described the meme as “complete nonsense” and “misinformation”.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey ( here ), published scientific estimates of the global CO2 emissions for all on land and submarine volcanos “lie in a range from 0.13 gigaton to 0.44 gigaton per year.”

This is a fraction of the CO2 produced by human activity. In 2021, the global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes alone reached a record high of 36.3 billion tonnes (or gigatons, GT), data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) showed ( here ). A graph by the IEA tracking the increase of emissions since 1899 is viewable ( here )

“On a global level, volcanoes currently emit just a few percent of the man-made CO2 production,” Bechkne said, highlighting that CO2 emissions of human activity have dramatically increased in the past decades, while volcanic emissions have not.

Simon Carn, Professor of Geological and Mining Engineering and Sciences at Michigan Technological University, concurred and said the best estimates for Mt. Etna’s volcanic CO2 emissions are at “~3 million tons per year.” “Hence Etna’s CO2 emissions are roughly ~0.01% of anthropogenic emissions in a typical year. A single eruption of Etna would emit much less CO2, and so the percentage would be even smaller.”

Large eruptions can indeed emit significant amounts of CO2, but these events are rare and are still small when compared with human emissions ( here ).

The largest volcanic eruptions in recent history emitted approximately 10-50 million tons of carbon dioxide, Carn told Reuters in 2020, while addressing a similar allegation ( here ).

Fact-checkers at the AFP, AAP and Climate Feedback have previously debunked the meme about Mt. Etna as well ( here ) ( here ) ( here )

VERDICT

False. Volcanoes are estimated to produce a fraction of the CO2 emitted by human activity.

Could Google’s Carbon Emissions Have Effectively Doubled Overnight?,"The temperature in parts of the Antarctic was seventy degrees Fahrenheit above normal in mid-March. Pakistan and India saw their hottest March and April in more than half a century, and the temperature in areas of the subcontinent is above a hundred and twenty degrees this week. Temperatures in Chicago last week topped those in Death Valley. But, on Tuesday, three nonprofit environmental groups jointly released a report containing a different set of numbers that appear to be nearly as scary. They indicate that the world’s biggest companies—and, indeed, any company or individual with cash in the bank—have been inadvertently fuelling the climate crisis. Such cash, left in banks and other financial institutions that lend to the fossil-fuel industry, builds pipelines and funds oil exploration and, in the process, produces truly immense amounts of carbon. The report raises deep questions about the sanity of our financial system, but it also suggests a potential realignment of corporate players that could move decisively to change the balance of power which has so far thwarted rapid climate action.

To grasp the implications of the new numbers, consider Google’s parent company, Alphabet. It has worked hard to rein in the emissions from its products. Last year, for example, Google Sustainability published an account of the work it put into having casing suppliers convert from using virgin to recycled aluminum for Google’s new Pixel 5 phone, an immense effort involving everyone from the metallurgy team—which, the company said, “studied the chemical compositions of different recycled aluminum alloys and grades, looking for an optimal combination of alloying elements to meet our performance standards”—to executives who had “to go far upstream in the supply chain to the source that was supplying our aluminum, then negotiate a new type of deal that they’d never done before.” All this was done, Google said, in order to “lower the carbon footprint of manufacturing the enclosure by 35 percent.” It’s the kind of grinding work that goes on day after day at companies that take the climate crisis seriously.

But, according to the new report, these efforts have missed perhaps the most important source of corporate emissions: the money that these companies earn and then store in banks, equities, and bonds. The consortium of environmental groups—the Climate Safe Lending Network, the Outdoor Policy Outfit, and BankFWD—examined corporate financial statements to find out how much cash the world’s biggest companies had on hand, and then calculated how much carbon each dollar sitting in the financial system may have generated. According to these calculations, Google’s carbon emissions, in effect, would have risen a hundred and eleven per cent overnight. Meta’s emissions would have increased by a hundred and twelve per cent, and Apple’s by sixty-four per cent. For Microsoft in 2021, the report claims, “the emissions generated by the company’s $130 billion in cash and investments were comparable to the cumulative emissions generated by the manufacturing, transporting, and use of every Microsoft product in the world.” Amazon, too, has worked to cut emissions; it plans to run its delivery fleet on electric trucks, for instance. But in 2020, the report claims, its “$81 billion in cash and financial investments still generated more carbon emissions than emissions generated by the energy Amazon purchased to power all their facilities across the world—its fulfillment centers, data centers, physical stores.” Also according to the report, in 2021, the annual emissions from Netflix’s cash would have been ten times larger than what was produced by everyone in the world streaming their programming—which is to say, Netflix and heat.

The authors are quick to note caveats. The companies mentioned do not disclose banking arrangements; some of their cash is in the major banks, but some of it is reportedly held overseas, and a portion is in sovereign debt, such as Treasury bills, or in other assets that can be quickly sold, such as stocks. So the numbers, though precise, are extrapolations based on averages and emissions estimates. The report is based on research and analysis performed by South Pole, an international climate-finance consultancy that has worked with companies such as Nestle and Hilton on emissions reporting. South Pole maintains that “the carbon intensity figures for the asset classes analyzed in this report are conservative estimates that constitute an indicative underestimation of the actual emissions banks generate through their financial services”—and that, if you added in companies’ pension plans and insurance arrangements, it would “generate a larger financial footprint calculation than simply cash and investments.” Even if these figures are crude-cut, however, they are the first of their kind that we have seen and, as such, they offer a unique analysis.

Since the global-warming alarm was first publicly sounded, in the late nineteen-eighties, activists have pushed countries and companies to catalogue their emissions. Beginning in 2001, companies that want to pay attention to their progress—which includes the companies mentioned in the new report—have used a set of “greenhouse-gas protocols” which are overseen by the World Resources Institute, a global nonprofit organization. Under the protocols, a business can report its Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1 includes direct emissions from operations that a company controls or owns: a factory’s boilers; a delivery fleet’s gas tanks. Scope 2 emissions come from energy purchased by a company, such as those that a local utility produces when generating power for the company. And Scope 3 emissions are the indirect emissions that “occur in a company’s value chain,” such as, for example, the carbon produced by the companies that make the aluminum casings for Google’s phones.

Scope 3 emissions could also include downstream, indirect emissions—such as those produced by a company’s cash held in banks. In the official accounting framework that the World Resources Institute has provided to companies since the launch of its emissions protocols, there has been a space for carbon emissions that come from cash on hand—category 15, under Scope 3. But in the past most non-financial companies have left it blank, because there’s never been a good method for calculating those emissions. “There’s nothing more core to a business than making money—it’s the thing they exist to do,” Paul Moinester, the executive director of the Outdoor Policy Outfit, a think tank, said. “So the fact that we couldn’t incorporate the role that their money plays into their carbon emissions—there’s nothing more material than that.” Vanessa Fajans-Turner, who has announced a congressional run in upstate New York, is the executive director of BankFWD, which members of the Rockefeller family founded in part to track the carbon emissions of the financial system. She noted, “This is part of a company’s supply chain. They need to source financial resources and products. They need loans, they need places to keep their cash, they need interest rates, they need international transfers. These are things they source through a partner. That’s the definition of a supply chain.”

The effort to develop the new calculations began with conversations between James Vaccaro, a former European banker who heads the Climate Safe Lending Network, and Moinester. “We started to do some back-of-the-envelope calculations about how much carbon their cash was producing,” Vaccaro explained to me. “And we were, like, ‘This has to be wrong. Surely we’ve transposed a decimal place. This has to be an order of magnitude too large.’ ” The biggest banks, especially in the U.S., supply huge amounts of capital to keep the fossil-fuel industry expanding. According to Banking on Climate Chaos, an annual report from the Rainforest Action Network and other environmental organizations, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo have together disbursed more than a trillion dollars to the industry in the years since the Paris climate accord was adopted, in December, 2015. This includes to companies developing new projects that scientists, Indigenous leaders, and climate activists have decried, from the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines and new fracking fields to drilling in areas of the newly melted Arctic.

The environmental groups point out that the companies singled out in the report shouldn’t be embarrassed by the numbers, which are not exactly their fault. Instead, they say, the numbers should empower them—and any other operation or individual who’s making money and storing it in the U.S. financial system—to insist that banks stop lending money to finance the expansion of the fossil-fuel system. And, if they leaned on them as effectively as they do on, say, aluminum suppliers, the results could be remarkable. Google, for instance, is one of the world’s largest purchasers of renewable energy. But, the report states, if it could reduce its “financial footprint by 43%, the emissions reduction would be equivalent to the carbon savings Alphabet has generated” with all that solar and wind power. And maybe it will—after all, when Google did the work on its aluminum casings, the company noted that its suppliers had agreed to make the recycled aluminum “available to the consumer electronics industry as a whole,” because “it’s a core Google principle to try to lift all boats.”",,[],"['Condé Nast', 'Bill Mckibben']"
GERMAN LOGISTICS PARK REDUCES CO2 EMISSIONS BY 33% WITH ECOPACT,"Real estate developer SEGRO used ECOPact green concrete to revitalize a former coal mining area in Germany by building a new logistics park on the site. The project delivered 825 tons of CO2 savings, or a reduction of 33% compared to the German industry reference.

33% of CO2 emissions saved - or a total of 825 tons, equal to the same number of flights from Frankfurt to New York

With the help of ECOPact, the client hopes to obtain the German Sustainable Building Council's (DGNB) Platinum and Climate Positive certificate

9,500 m-3 of ECOPact green concrete fulfilled the client's resource-saving, recycled and low-carbon building materials requirements

THE CHALLENGE

The new state-of-the-art SEGRO Logistics Park Oberhausen , located in the heart of Germany's Ruhr region, is a new revitalization project on a former coal-mining site. Its total area covers 21 hectares, or the equivalent of about 30 football fields, with a storage area of about 120,000 square meters. Its buildings have all been designed according to the latest standards for sustainable, ecological and energy-conscious construction.

With this project, SEGRO wanted to make an impression for sustainability, aiming for their first German Sustainable Building Council's (DGNB) Platinum and Climate Positive sustainability certificates. Given these ambitions, SEGRO aimed to use as much resource-saving, recycled and low-carbon building materials from the region as possible.

THE SOLUTION

Holcim Germany proposed using ECOPact, the world's broadest range of low-carbon concrete, offering 30% to 100% less carbon emissions compared to standard (CEM I) concrete. Even better, ECOPact was produced in the nearby Oberhausen operations, which optimized transport efficiency and thereby further decreased the environmental footprint.

Holcim delivered a total of 9,500 m-3 of ECOPact, of which 7,500 m-3 consisted of ECOPact with steel fibers, designed for loads from forklift traffic with a maximum of approximately 5 tons. The remaining 2,000 m3 were used for the foundation and other building elements.

THE RESULT

Thanks to ECOPact, a total of 825 tons of CO2 were saved in Oberhausen, equal to the same number of flights from Frankfurt to New York . This represents an emissions reduction of 33% compared to the German industry reference. The ECOPact formula with steel fibers also enabled the reduction of the reinforcement by 40%, helping SEGRO to reduce the dead weight of construction and speed up the project.

'SEGRO wants to become climate-neutral by 2030. The use of Holcim's green concrete helps us a lot because indirect CO2 emissions are one of our biggest challenges. Reducing these emissions not only helps us to achieve our climate targets, but is also a good argument in exchanges with municipalities and tenants.'

Cemex to Use Coolbrook’s Roto Dynamic Heater to Reduce CO2 Emissions,"Cemex, a building materials company, is the first company to announce it aims to use Coolbrook’s Roto Dynamic Heater to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from cement production. This comes in addition to Coolbrook’s existing partnerships with ABB and Shell. The Roto Dynamic Heater (RDH) technology uses electrification to remove the need for the burning of fossil fuels in the highest-emitting industrial processes. Powered by electricity from renewable sources, the RDH is the only process heating technology in the world that can cut up to 30% of industrial CO2 emissions and over 7% of global CO2 emissions annually, the company says.

Industrial CO2 emissions originate primarily from three main sectors: petrochemicals and chemicals, iron and steel, and cement production. The RDH, powered by electricity from renewable sources, can achieve process temperatures of up to around 1700 ºC with high energy efficiency and can thereby be used in processes that were impossible to electrify up until now. RDH is the only electric technology able to reach temperature levels required in highest-emitting industrial sectors such as petrochemicals and chemicals, iron and steel and cement, according to Coolbrook. Due to its compact size, the RDH can also be retro-fitted to existing facilities and thereby significantly accelerate the much needed CO2 emission reduction investments.

The technology has been in development for over a decade and marks the second major technology developed by Coolbrook after its Roto Dynamic Reactor (RDR), which can be used to electrify the steam cracking process in the petrochemical industry.

Roberto Ponguta, Cemex VP of global operations for technical and energy said, “The electrification of the production process is an important step towards fully decarbonizing our cement operations. We are constantly looking for the best technologies and relationships to meet our Net Zero CO2 target. Our cooperation with Coolbrook will support us in achieving this ambition.”

Cemex has also recently successfully tested a process that converts flue gasses emitted by the cement kiln into carbon nanomaterials, thereby transforming “bad” carbon into “good” carbon. It has also helped finance a carbon dioxide-embedded cement and concrete additive.",,[],"['Staff Writer', 'Environment Energy Leader']"
E-bikes could save 50% of carbon emissions,"LOS ANGELES — As Los Angeles cyclists take to the streets on two wheels as part of Bike to Work Day, a new study from The Bike Adviser website reports that e-bikes could reduce as much as 50% of carbon emissions if used to replace short car trips.

Using data from the U.S. Census and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the study ranked states based on where e-bikes have the most potential to reduce emissions. While California ranked 21st among all states for the percentage of short car trips in the U.S., it ranked first for CO2 emissions.

The website defines a short car trip as up to five miles. In California, 55.2% of car trips are considered short. Collectively, those trips generate 51,370 metric tons of carbon dioxide daily.

If 8% of those trips were taken with an e-bike instead, it would save enough energy to charge 49 million smartphones or fly 4,442 planes round trip between New York and London, according to the study. If 50% of trips were replaced with e-bikes, the energy saved could power 3 billion smart phones or power 27,764 New York-to-London round trips.

While Washington D.C., Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Ohio have the highest percentages of car trips that are five miles or fewer, California presents the greatest opportunity for emissions savings by swapping cars for e-bikes because of the number of registered vehicles.",,[],['Published Am Pt May.']
6 things to know about direct air capture,"This article was originially publish on World Resources Institute's blog. Read it here.

As the effects of climate change are increasingly felt through more severe storms, wildfires and flooding, the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions — such as by switching to electric vehicles, deploying solar panels and reducing deforestation — is critical. At the same time, the latest climate science indicates that such efforts will not be enough to keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius, which would prevent the worst impacts of climate change.

While efforts to reduce GHG emissions should always take priority, meeting climate goals will also require carbon dioxide removal (CDR) — systems that remove carbon directly from the air — likely at the billion-tonne scale by mid-century. Carbon removal is needed not only to balance out residual emissions that cannot be or are not eliminated by 2050, but also to reduce the high concentration of carbon dioxide in the air, which is triggering increasingly devastating climate change impacts. The United States, as the largest cumulative historical emitter of CO2, has a responsibility to be a leader in pulling it back out of the atmosphere. The precise amount needed will depend on how fast the world reduces emissions.

Carbon removal can take numerous forms — including natural solutions such as growing trees and increasing the ability of soil to sequester carbon, and technological solutions that accelerate or mimic natural carbon removal processes or directly pull CO2 from the air. Direct air capture (DAC) is one type of technological carbon removal that shows promise today and will likely be part of a larger carbon removal portfolio. Compared to other types of carbon removal it uses relatively little space and can also be sited flexibly, so would avoid competition with other land uses and could be built on marginal land or near geological storage sites to minimize the need for CO2 pipelines.

Here we answer some key questions about DAC.

1. What is direct air capture?

Direct air capture is a technology that uses chemical reactions to pull carbon dioxide out of air. When air moves over these chemicals, they selectively react with and trap CO2, allowing the other components of air to pass through. Today’s leading systems use either liquid solvents or solid sorbents, which are composed of common chemicals that are already in use in other applications today, from soap to water filtration.

Once carbon dioxide is captured from the atmosphere, heat is typically applied to release it from the solvent or sorbent. Doing so regenerates the solvent or sorbent for another capture cycle. Other systems in development use electrochemical processes, which could reduce energy needs and cost.

The captured CO2 can then be injected deep underground for sequestration in certain geologic formations or used in various products and applications. The carbon benefit of use in products, or the net quantity of carbon that is durably stored, depends on the product. Use in products such as concrete or plastic can provide long-term sequestration (decades or even centuries), whereas using carbon dioxide in products such as beverages or synthetic fuel would quickly re-release carbon into the atmosphere.

In some cases — jet fuel, for example — synthetic fuel produced with CO2 could still be a more favorable substitute for more emissions-intensive fossil fuel. However, to maximize climate benefit, most captured CO2 would need to go to vast and permanent underground sequestration rather than useful but more limited use routes.

One type of geological storage includes injecting carbon dioxide underground into certain types of rock where it is stored permanently. This rock core, from the Carbfix project in Iceland, shows carbonates created from the injected CO2. Photo by Carbfix.

2. How technologically ready is direct air capture for widespread use?

DAC has seen a surge in interest and investment over the past few years and a growing number of companies are entering the space. This is due to the understanding that carbon removal will increasingly be needed to meet national and global climate goals, along with benefits of DAC compared to other carbon removal approaches, which include few practical limits on scaling, relatively little land area use, and siting flexibility.

Companies with the most developed technologies today include Climeworks, Carbon Engineering and Global Thermostat (see table below). Together these companies have 18 plants of varying sizes (1 tCO2/yr up to 4,000 tCO2/yr capacity, the largest plant in operation today) capturing a total of just under 8,000 tCo2/yr. Around half of that is sequestered permanently — similar to the annual emissions from 870 cars — while the other half is sold for use in various products.

A DAC plant with 1 million-tonne per year capacity is under development in the Southwest of the U.S. and is expected to be operational in late 2024. Other companies have been established more recently, using solvent, sorbent and other innovative types of technology.

DAC is categorized as ""technology readiness level"" 6 (on a scale of 1 to 9), meaning it’s still in the large-scale and prototype phase, not yet ready for full commercial deployment. But this also means there’s ample opportunity to improve performance and reduce costs through learning from early iterations of the technology.

3. How much does direct air capture cost?

Despite the benefits and flexibility, direct air capture is more costly per tonne of CO2 removed compared to many mitigation approaches and natural climate solutions as it is energy intensive to separate carbon dioxide from ambient air. The range of costs for DAC vary between $250 and $600 today depending on the technology choice, low-carbon energy source and the scale of their deployment; for comparison, most reforestation costs less than $50/tonne.

However, depending on the rate of deployment, which could accelerate through supportive policies and market development, costs for DAC could fall to around $150-$200 per tonne over the next five to 10 years. Going further than this, the Department of Energy launched its Carbon Negative Shot initiative in late 2021, which aims to reduce the cost of carbon removal technologies and approaches that could reach gigaton scale to $100/tCO2 over the next decade.

Another reason for high costs today is there are relatively few DAC companies and projects — developing more projects will provide learning that could reduce costs. And it’s important to note that DAC offers quantifiable and permanent storage, whereas natural carbon removal solutions such as trees are at risk of deforestation and climate change-induced threats such as wildfires and drought.

DAC also provides atmospheric clean-up, which is a public good rather than a product people need to purchase, so opportunities for direct revenue are more limited. Captured CO2 can be sold for use in products from concrete aggregate to carbon fiber, markets that don’t typically provide enough revenue to offset the cost of capture. The largest market for CO2 today is enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which is controversial given its connection to fossil fuel production.

Ultimately, the greatest climate benefit for DAC comes from geologic sequestration for which there is no revenue opportunity beyond public policy support. Public investment in and support of carbon removal technology has increased in the past few years, but more will be needed to scale sufficiently and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

4. What policies and investments are supporting DAC development in the U.S.?

The most important federal policy supporting DAC today is the 45Q tax credit, which provides up to $35-50 per tonne of CO2 captured through DAC and carbon capture at point sources ($50/tCO2) if the captured carbon is sequestered underground and $35/tCO2 if it’s used for EOR or elsewhere). There have been several legislative proposals to enhance 45Q by providing higher credit values and extending its timeline, along with other changes.

The federal government also funds research, development and demonstration for many types of carbon removal, including DAC. The Department of Energy’s funding for CDR has increased significantly from less than $10 million 2009-2019 to $129 million in the most recent (fiscal year 2022) budget.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also provides an unprecedented amount of funding over the next five years specifically for DAC: $3.5 billion for four DAC hubs, $100 million for a commercial DAC prize, and $15 million for a pre-commercial DAC prize. There is also $4.6 billion funding to support enabling infrastructure such as CO2 pipelines and geologic sequestration, which is needed for both DAC and point source capture, such as capturing emissions from cement plants.

At the state level, California’s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard provides a credit for DAC plants, either inside or outside California, on the order of $200/tCO2. This credit was instrumental to making Carbon Engineering’s million-tonne DAC plant — in development in the U.S. Southwest — economically viable. It will be the first large-scale DAC plant in the world.

Various other bills have been introduced at the federal and state levels to support carbon removal. The Federal Carbon Dioxide Removal Leadership Act would require the federal government to procure increasing amounts of carbon removal. A similar bill in New York state — the Carbon Dioxide Removal Leadership Act — would require state procurement of CDR.

In addition to federal and state policies, corporate investment in carbon removal and DAC is also increasing. This has been led by companies such as Stripe, Shopify and Microsoft which have committed hundreds of millions of dollars to carbon removal, including DAC. Many other companies aside from these early movers are making purchases as well.

5. What are the unintended impacts of using direct air capture?

While organizations such as the IPCC indicate the need for significant amounts of carbon removal to meet our climate goals, care must be taken to ensure that ramping up DAC does not distract from essential attention and investment in other mitigation measures, especially to reduce fossil fuel use. Scientists indicate we will need both faster emissions reduction and carbon removal, and the amount of carbon removal needed is inversely proportional to how deeply we are able to cut emissions.

Strong policy and private sector guardrails are needed to ensure countries and companies do not over-rely on carbon removal at the expense of emissions reductions. For example, the Science Based Target initiative’s recent net-zero guidance requires companies to meet their climate targets by reducing more than 90 percent of their own emissions and using carbon removal to compensate for only the remaining 5-10 percent that they cannot directly mitigate.

With DAC, some are concerned about the connection to fossil fuel production through EOR (as mentioned before), which­ uses captured CO2 to produce more oil from depleted wells. While EOR permanently sequesters the injected CO2, it also produces oil, which produces more emissions. Fossil fuel company investments in DAC with EOR can thus be seen as a way to continue producing fossil fuels and slowing the energy transition.

For all types of CO2 capture, community concerns have been raised around CO2 pipelines and geological storage of CO2, particularly around safety and the possibility of leakage for both. These concerns are especially salient given a 2020 CO2 pipeline rupture in Mississippi paired with $4.6 billion in funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for CO2 transport and storage. CO2 pipelines have been used since the 1970s and, like oil and gas pipelines, pose non-zero risks. However, with expected investment ramping up, attention is needed to ensure they have adequate safeguards for operational safety as well as consideration of impact on the environment and people. Geological storage has been demonstrated safely at million-tonne volumes, but expanding to multi-million- or billion-tonne scales similarly requires further attention to regulatory needs.

Because DAC is a newer type of infrastructure, there is limited information about how it would impact local communities — either positively or negatively. More research will be needed to understand these impacts on a project-by-project basis along with proactive engagement with potentially affected communities.

6. What are the main resource impacts of DAC?

Energy

The two main direct air capture systems in use today have different temperature requirements, which affects the types of energy required to operate them. Liquid solvent systems require 652 degrees F to release captured CO2, whereas solid sorbent systems require 176 to 248 degrees F. This means that solid sorbent systems can use waste heat or renewable energy, while solvent systems currently rely on natural gas with carbon capture and storage. For both systems, the energy is roughly 80 percent heat and 20 percent electricity.

Energy sources need to be zero- or very low-carbon to maximize net capture efficiency —otherwise more CO2 emissions will be produced using the energy than would be captured from the air in the process. Climeworks’ solid sorbent system estimates a long-term energy requirement of 7.2 GJ (or 2,000 kWh/tCO2) — equivalent to around one-fifth of a U.S. household’s annual natural gas consumption — while near-term energy needs would be a bit higher. Carbon Engineering has similarly estimated energy requirements of around 8.8 GJ/tCO2 (or 2,400 kWh/tCO2).

Scaling up today’s DAC systems would use non-trivial amounts of energy. Reaching 7 million to 9 million tonnes per year of capture capacity in the U.S. by 2030 (proposed by the Bipartisan Policy Center’s DAC Council and the Rhodium Group, respectively) would use 0.3-0.4 percent of today’s U.S electricity generation. Capacity of renewable energy sources already needs to expand significantly to decarbonize power production and electrify sectors such as buildings and transport, and additional renewable capacity would also be needed for DAC and other types of carbon removal, so as not to compete with other uses. This renewable energy scale up will come with its own impacts, such as those related to expanded mining activities for rare earth metals.

Learning through deployment could help optimize existing systems to reduce energy needs, while research and development funding will help develop entirely new systems with lower energy burdens.

Land

One of the biggest benefits of direct air capture is siting flexibility. DAC does not require arable land, which can minimize impacts on food production or other land uses. The land area needed for large-scale deployment depends on the type of DAC system and the energy resource powering it. If renewables are used, they will be the largest portion of the land footprint.

DAC requires a smaller amount of land per tonne of CO2 removed than some other leading CDR approaches, such as reforestation. To capture 1 million tonnes of CO2, a DAC plant would need 4.3 to 7 square feet for the plant and the energy resource, while capturing a similar amount of CO2 from forests would require an estimated 9.3 square feet.

Both tree restoration and DAC, along with other approaches and technologies, have tradeoffs that must be weighed up because they are all needed as part of a larger carbon removal portfolio.

Water

Water usage associated with direct air capture also depends on the system type, as well as local temperature and humidity.

For a solvent DAC system, capturing one tonne of CO2 can require one to seven tonnes of water for plausible siting locations in the U.S., comparable to the amounts of water required to produce a tonne of cement or steel. Water losses come mainly through evaporation, so the relative humidity and temperature of the plant’s location are the main determinants of the level of water loss, with higher losses in hot and dry environments.

The solid sorbent DAC systems in development and production today vary widely in terms of water usage, depending on the sorbent regeneration method. A system that uses steam condensation to regenerate the sorbent may result in water losses to the environment — a typical plant may use 1.6 tonnes of water per tonne of CO2 captured. Other systems regenerate the sorbent using indirect heating, meaning minimal water losses. And these indirect heating systems, such as Climeworks’ solid sorbent systems, are actually net water producers, yielding an estimated 0.8-2 tonnes of water per tonne of CO2 captured.

Because resource usage is linked to community impacts, the people living near DAC plants or parts of the DAC supply chain will also be impacted.

Direct air capture: an important part of a climate solution portfolio

Climate models make it increasingly clear that carbon dioxide removal will likely need to happen on a multi-billion-tonne scale by mid-century along with deep emissions reductions. And the slower we are to reduce emissions, the more we may need to rely on carbon removal — including DAC — to meet national and global climate goals.

Achieving large-scale carbon removal will require a portfolio of different approaches, which will reduce cost and the risk of any one approach failing to provide expected removal. Investing in DAC now will help reduce future costs, which can prove critical as carbon dioxide removal becomes even more necessary.

Port of Rotterdam ups its CO2 emissions reduction game,"June 3, 2022, by Naida Hakirevic Prevljak

The Dutch Port of Rotterdam Authority aims to accelerate the reduction of its own carbon emissions and eventually become an entirely emission-free port.

Today, most of the CO2 of the Port Authority is emitted by patrol vessels. CO2 is also emitted by the use of cars and buildings. It concerns 4,000 tonnes per year in total.

The port authority’s own carbon emissions should be 75% lower in 2025 and 90% lower in 2030 than in 2019, with the ultimate goal of achieving a 100% reduction.

“We are going to reduce our own carbon emissions as quickly as possible, while compensating in full what we still emit. So from that perspective, the port authority is already carbon neutral as we speak. Because our emissions will be lower and lower in the next few years, the compensation required will also decrease more and more,” Allard Castelein, CEO Port of Rotterdam Authority, commented.

In the past year, the port authority used so-called science-based targeting to calculate the emission reduction amount required to pull its weight to keep global warming below the 1.5 degrees celcius limit. Science-based targeting is a way of translating the Paris Climate Agreement per company into specific targets. With this method, the port authority intends to achieve a reduction of at least 46.2% by 2030 (in comparison with 2019).

As this seems to be technically feasible, however, the port authority opts for accelerated reduction of its own emissions by 90% in 2030. To this end, the port will ensure that all its vessels will switch completely to biofuel in the short term, and it has the ambition that from 2025 new vessels will be emission-free.

The port authority also wants to realise lower carbon emissions in other areas. Emission caused by its employees’ air travel is to be reduced by 70% in 2025 and by 80% in 2030, as a result of flying less and participation in a biokerosene programme.

Reduction objectives have been formulated for assignments awarded to contractors of the port as well. In this case, it is about a 45% reduction by 2030 with the use of fuels (especially dredging and earthmoving) and 20% for (construction) materials. Huge amounts of steel are used in the construction of quay walls, for example. Since its production provisionally involves high carbon emissions, 20% in 2030 seems to be the maximum feasible level.

Reasons for tightening the climate targets include the recent climate studies of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the ‘Fit for 55’ plans of the European Commission, and the Glasgow Climate Summit at which the target of a maximum temperature increase of 1.5 degrees celcius was confirmed.

Industry and shipping

The port authority said it does its utmost for emission reduction in shipping and industry, although it cannot influence this directly.

This approach is based on two studies by the German Wuppertal Institut from 2017 and 2018 respectively into the emissions of industry and shipping and the transition paths for both sectors.

For shipping in the port management area (which reaches as far as 60km off the coast) the emissions should be reduced by 20% in 2030. To make this happen, various developments are in progress, like efficiency increase, the application of shore power and bunkering clean fuels (such as LNG, biofuels, and methanol).

This should be made possible by projects on capturing CO2 and storing it beneath the North Sea bed (Porthos), construction of pipes for hydrogen and residual heat, and attracting innovative developments, such as the production of green hydrogen and biofuels.

All these projects together amount to some 23 million tonnes of carbon reduction in the port and outside (by the use of biofuels produced there, for example). This is 35% of the Dutch carbon reduction objective for 2030.

Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions with Serverless and Kubernetes Native Java,"Key Takeaways More organizations are moving application workloads to multi- and hybrid cloud platforms that offer better scalability and performance, but more carbon dioxide emissions.

Java isn’t the first-class choice to optimize the performance on the Kubernetes cloud even though Java is still the 3rd most popular programming language according to the TIOBE Index.

Serverless architecture aims to reduce the amount of on-demand compute consumption time.

Native Java compilation aims to solve the performance issues, but also reduce the compute resources utilization on Kubernetes and serverless platforms.

Quarkus, the Kubernetes Native Java framework, provides container-first and natively native features with milliseconds first boot time and tiny resident set size (RSS) memory that minimizes the resource consumption of cloud services at speed and scale.



With the rise of adopting cloud deployment, IT departments consume fewer physical servers, less electric power, and eventually help mitigate climate change by reducing carbon emissions. Cloud architectures help with this because they don’t need to maintain siloed compute resources, but instead enable sharing of available resources efficiently on the cloud where they are located and when they require to keep their business services running.

However, these benefits of the cloud movement didn’t significantly impact carbon dioxide emissions in a short period of time. This is due to the speed of cloud adoption being much faster than moving to carbon-free infrastructures. For example, Google Cloud is carbon neutral today but they’re trying to put more effort into becoming carbon-free and sustainable cloud computing systems.

In the meantime, developers and architects continue to put maximum effort into optimizing application performance in terms of smaller container images, faster startup and response times, and lesser memory footprints. They believe that this eventually enables the reduction of compute consumption in the application layer.

Java Designed For a Different Time

Related Sponsored Content The 2022 Cloud Report

Java was born 27 years ago to run business services with a variety of benefits such as high network throughput, long-running processes, and dynamic behavior for mutable systems. Decades ago, these were really great features for developers to write flexible and rich applications over the Internet and then run them on several application servers across infrastructure from physical servers to virtual machines.

However, things changed since Kubernetes and Linux containers were unleashed upon the world. It brought us a new paradigm to re-architect existing applications that should be dealt with cattle over cats on the cloud. The main characteristics of the new applications are portability, immutability, and scalability at speed.



Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Java is not a great benefit in this new era. Nevertheless, enterprises still maintain lots of mission-critical business applications built on the Java stack which could be a roadblock to lifting and shifting the workloads to the cloud platforms. It also makes the enterprises lose opportunities to reduce carbon dioxide emissions since they need to keep the monolith applications on traditional infrastructure by spending more money.

Ironically, Java is still the 3rd most popular programming language according to the TIOBE Index. With regard to this trend, many open source projects and tools (e.g., Shenandoah GC) came out to optimize Java performance in terms of throughput management by scaling, ephemeral status, and smaller memory footprints on immutable systems. Unfortunately, those efforts weren’t enough to browbeat developers’ minds to leave Java applications on the Kubernetes clusters rather than taking alternatives such as Javascript and Python.

Serverless Java

As a part of endless efforts to reduce compute resources on cloud computing, many enterprises have realized that all business services aren't required to run all the time (e.g., 24 x 7 x 365) by monitoring application workloads along with resource usages periodically.

For example, certain services (e.g., an order service) are only visited less than 10% of the entire services by end-users and third parties. In that case, the serverless architecture enables you to scale down the application to zero automatically when there’s no network traffic to the application during a certain period of time (e.g., 5 minutes or 30 seconds).

In fact, the serverless behavior can be applied not only to HTTP-based microservices but also to distributed streaming services from the Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices and Kafka message servers.

Here is your question as a Java developer, “How does Java deal with a serverless architecture?”. The bigger question is “Can Java even fit in developing serverless applications?” Traditionally, developers tended not to run Java applications on AWS Lambda according to the NewRelic survey due to the heavyweight package and dynamic behavior, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. For the Love of Serverless

That’s the reason why more developers would like to bring Node.Js and Python applications into serverless platforms and Function as a Service (FaaS) more than evolving existing Java applications. Don’t give up your Java skill set! You’ll figure out how you make your Java applications more fittable in the serverless architecture in the next section.

Natively Native Java

Building a native executable Java application brings not only huge benefits, such as faster startup and response time with a smaller memory footprint but also solves the above challenges of the traditional Java stack. Let’s take a look a bit deeper at how the native executable works! The native executable is built using an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler that makes a standalone native image with application classes, dependency libraries, and runtimes. You can understand that it’s similar to Linux container images that contain all things needed to run an application across any container runtimes and Kubernetes as well.

With native executables, you don’t need a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to run your Java applications anymore. Instead, the native image can be running on a Substrate VM which is the runtime components (e.g., garbage collector, thread scheduling) in GraalVM.

Native compilation for Java also makes developers’ minds stick with Java applications for the serverless workloads because the native executables can reduce the startup time for the cold start which is one of the biggest challenges when many enterprises want to adopt the serverless architecture.

Here is a quickstart on how to install the necessary C library and dependencies to compile a native executable image for your Java applications on your operating system.

Install C Libraries

To get supported for a native compilation in C, you also need to install GCC and relevant libraries using the following commands:

Fedora distributions:

$ sudo dnf install gcc glibc-devel zlib-devel libstdc++-static

Debian distributions:

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libz-dev zlib1g-dev

macOS

$ xcode-select --install

For more information on how to install GraalVM, visit this website.

Configure GraalVM

Set the GRAALVM_HOME environment variable based on your operating system:

Linux

$ export GRAALVM_HOME=$HOME/Development/graalvm/

macOS

$ export GRAALVM_HOME=$HOME/Development/graalvm/Contents/Home/

Install the native-image tool:

${GRAALVM_HOME}/bin/gu install native-image

If you haven’t already done so, set the JAVA_HOME environment variable using the following command:

$ export JAVA_HOME=${GRAALVM_HOME}

However, producing a native image requires providing lots of information about your application in advance. The reflection will only work if a class or method has been explicitly registered. This will require Java developers to convert all existing applications for registering reflection before building a native executable image.

Getting Started with Kubernetes Native Java: Quarkus

If you could continue to develop your cloud-native microservices without spending too much time handling the reflection, then do you just need to build a native executable image before you deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster? I’m pretty sure that would be great for Java developers.

Quarkus is an open source project that aims to provide a standard Java stack that enables Java developers not only to build a container-first application on OpenJDK, but also to compile a native executable for running on the Kubernetes cluster with the following benefits:

Move as much as possible to build phase

Minimize runtime dependencies

Maximize dead code elimination

Introduce clear metadata contracts

Enhance developer experiences (e.g. DEV UI, Dev Services, Command Line)

Quarkus also provides an extension, Funqy, that aims to write portable serverless functions across serverless platforms such as OpenShift serverless, Knative, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google cloud platform.

Here is a quick guide on how to create a new serverless function with a native executable compilation using Quarkus.

Create a New Serverless Java Project

Let’s scaffold a new Quarkus project to create a function using the Quarkus command line tool:

$ quarkus create quarkus-serverless-example -x funqy-http

This command allows you to download the Funqy extension to enable Quarkus Funqy capabilities. The output should look like this:

Creating an app (default project type, see --help). ----------- selected extensions: - io.quarkus:quarkus-funqy-http applying codestarts... java maven quarkus config-properties dockerfiles maven-wrapper funqy-http-codestarts -----------

[SUCCESS] ✅ quarkus project has been successfully generated in:

--> /Users/USERNAME/quarkus-serverless-example -----------

Explore the Function

Go to the root directory where you created the project, then open the MyFunctions.java file in the src/main/java/org/acme directory. A simple function method (fun) is generated by default to return a greeting message. The @Funq annotation makes the general method a function that you can access by a RESTful API.

@Funq public String fun(FunInput input) { return String.format(""Hello %s!"", input != null ? input.name : ""Funqy""); }

You can add your business logic with a new function or an existing one. Let’s leave the default code for now.

Build and Deploy a Native Executable to Kubernetes

Quarkus provides an OpenShift extension to build the application and then deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster. Execute the following Quarkus command line to add the extension:

$ cd quarkus-serverless-example $ quarkus ext add openshift

The output should look like this:

Looking for the newly published extensions in registry.quarkus.io

[SUCCESS] ✅ Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-openshift has been installed

Add the following configurations for the Kubernetes deployment to the application.properties file in the src/main/resources directory. You will need to replace YOUR_NAMESPACE with a namespace (e.g., doh-dev ) where you deploy the function.

quarkus.container-image.group=YOUR_NAMESPACE quarkus.container-image.registry=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000 quarkus.kubernetes-client.trust-certs=true quarkus.kubernetes.deployment-target=knative quarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true quarkus.openshift.build-strategy=docker quarkus.openshift.expose=true

You can also build a native executable image using a container runtime (e.g. Docker or Podman) when you set the following configuration:

quarkus.native.container-build=true

Note that you can find the solution repository here.

To deploy the function, you can use your own Kubernetes cluster (e.g., minikube) but I’ll encourage you to use the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift which provides a shared Kubernetes cluster when you sign up for a free account. The sandbox enables you to spin up a new Kubernetes cluster in 10 minutes without any installations or configurations on your local file system.

Execute the following Quarkus command line to build and deploy the function to the Kubernetes cluster:

$ quarkus build --native --no-tests

The output should end with ​ ​BUILD SUCCESS message.

When you go to the Topology view in the OpenShift Dev Console, your Java function (e.g., quarkus-serverless-example-00001 ) is already deployed. The function might be scaled down to zero since the Knative service is set 30 seconds by default when the function goes down if there’s no network traffic to the function pod, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Function in Topology view

Note that you can add a new label to REV and KSVC to display the pod as a Quarkus function which allows you to easily differentiate the other pods in the Topology view. Use the oc command line as below:

Add a Quarkus label to REV

oc label rev/quarkus-serverless-example-00001 app.openshift.io/runtime=quarkus --overwrite

Add a Function label to KSVC

oc label ksvc/quarkus-serverless-example boson.dev/function=true --overwrite

Copy the Route URL then paste the following CURL command line to access the function. For example, the route looks like https://quarkus-serverless-example-doh-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com.

$ curl --header ""Content-Type: application/json"" \ --request POST \ --data '{""name"":""Daniel""}' \ YOUR_ROUTE_URL/fun

The output should look like this:

Hello Daniel!

When you go back to the Topology view, you will see the function pod goes up automatically in a second, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Scale-up Function

When you view the pod’s logs, you will see the Java serverless function is running as a native image. It also took 17 milliseconds to start up, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Startup time for a native executable

What a supersonic and subatomic application! From now on, these new Java serverless functions enable you to optimize the resource performance and reduce the carbon dioxide emissions on Kubernetes.

Conclusion

This article guides you on how Java serverless applications can help your organizations reduce carbon dioxide emissions through higher resource density than any other programming languages on the container platform (e.g. Kubernetes), as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Resource density of multiple applications on a container platform

Developers are also able to build a native image for the Java application by choosing one of three GraalVM distributions, Oracle GraalVM Community Edition (CE), Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition (EE), and Mandrel.

Steel industry carbon emissions to drop nearly 1/3 by 2050 - Woodmac,"An employee monitors molten iron being poured into a container at a steel plant in Hefei, Anhui province September 9, 2013. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo

BEIJING, May 17 (Reuters) - Carbon dioxide emissions from the world's steel sector will fall 30% by 2050 compared with last year as more mills turns to less-polluting electric arc furnaces (EAF), consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in a study on Tuesday.

Around 48% of global crude steel will be made via EAF by 2050, according to Woodmac, increasing from 30% in 2021 and almost on a par with traditional blast furnace steelmaking.

""Together with green hydrogen-based direct reduced iron (used in EAF), scrap use and adoption of carbon capture, utilisation and storage, steel industry's carbon emissions can decline 30% from current levels by mid-century,"" Malan Wu, research director with Woodmac said in a release.

The steel sector discharged more than 3.3 billion tonnes of the greenhouse gas last year, the consultancy said, with more than 2 billion tonnes contributed by China, the world's top producer of the metal.

It expects China to lead the cut, halving its carbon emissions in the coming three decades, though most of the reduction will be due to falling steel output.

China slashed some 30 million tonnes of crude steel production in 2021 from a year earlier in an effort to meet its carbon commitments, and pledged another annual decline this year.

Tight scrap supply could pose a threat to China's decarbonisation, as hiking scrap prices will pressure steel margins in coming years, Woodmac's Malan Wu told Reuters.

Mills in mature economies, such as Japan, South Korea, the European Union and the United States, will face more of an onus since they need to slash almost 50% of emissions while seeing their output no lower than current levels.

Steel emissions in India and southeast Asia, however, are anticipated to double, as their production will triple but mainly through traditional, more polluting technologies, said Woodmac.

The consultancy also sees the ferrous sector launching hydrogen use as early as 2027, led by the European Union, and 10% of total steel output to be based on hydrogen by 2025.

"Worldwide Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Technologies Industry Report to 2040","DUBLIN, June 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The ""The Global Market for Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Technologies"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Research and Markets Logo

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) refers to technologies that capture CO2 emissions and use or store them, leading to permanent sequestration.

CCUS technologies capture of carbon dioxide emissions from large power sources, including power generation or industrial facilities that use either fossil fuels or biomass for fuel. CO2 can also be captured directly from the atmosphere. If not utilized onsite, captured CO2 is compressed and transported by pipeline, ship, rail or truck to be used in a range of applications, or injected into deep geological formations (including depleted oil and gas reservoirs or saline formations) which trap the CO2 for permanent storage.

Carbon removal technologies include direct air capture (DAC) or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). This fast growing market is being driven by government climate initiatives and increased public and private investments. In 2022 there has been over $1 billion in private investment in CCUS companies.

The market for CO2 use is expected to remain relatively small in the near term (<$2.5 billion), but will grow in the next few years in the drive to mitigate carbon emissions from industry. New pathways to use CO2in the production of fuels, chemicals and building materials are driving global interest, allied to increasing backing from governments, industry and investors, with global private funding for CO2utilization start-ups and companies reaching nearly USD1billion in 2022 already. Climeworks, a Swiss startup developing direct air capture (DAC) raised a $650m round in April 2022.

Energy executives urge near-term transition solutions amid supply crunch,"NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Energy executives at a Reuters conference on Wednesday urged shorter-term solutions such as efficiency and conservation amid a fuel supply crunch, saying companies must scramble to meet climate targets set for 2030.

Global oil and gas supplies have tightened and fuel costs have skyrocketed since Russia invasion of Ukraine, shifting the industry's focus toward supplying current energy demand, including ramping up coal production for power generation, which would increase greenhouse gas emissions.

Enel (ENEI.MI) Chief Executive Francesco Starace said the fallout from Russia's invasion nearly four months agohas forced Europe to look for natural gas from other sources, but the focus on increasing fossil fuel supply to the region was just temporary.

""This is just a surviving tool to get out of this period of inflation,"" Starace said at the Reuters Global Energy Transition 2022 conference in New York City.

Longer term, the Ukraine crisis will help boost Europe's transition away from fossil fuels by demonstrating how dangerous it can be to rely on unreliable foreign supply. The Italian utility has decided to search for a buyer for its assets in Russia, Starace said.

""The real trend, as a consequence of the crisis in Ukraine, is we will see an acceleration in the renewable energy space,"" he said, pointing out renewable sources like wind and solar can be tapped domestically in European countries and abroad.

Global CO2 emissions rose to their highest level in history in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency, as economic growth rebounded from the depths of the coronavirus pandemic and coal-fired generation surged. That will continue unless countries like the United States work on helping some nations shift to natural gas.

""Right now between India and China alone there is a plan to build close to 600 coal plants. They will operate for three and four decades; they will devastate the atmosphere's carbon budget,"" said Ralph Izzo, CEO of U.S. utility Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), on the sidelines of the conference. ""We can help mitigate that by having them switch from coal to natural gas.""

The industry is not doing enough to help reduce carbon emissions for the current decade, instead prioritizing solutions for after 2030, said Guillaume Le Gouic, senior vice president of power systems for Schneider Electric.

In the mining industry, some expect there to be a supply crunch in the late 2020s, as late adopters of lower-carbon solutions hurry to execute on renewable projects, said Keith Russell, a director of consultancy Partners In Performance. Too many projects are being left for later, Russell said.

Companies must tolerate some risk and failure when investing in renewable energy projects, as not all will make it to market, said Allyson Anderson Book, vice president for the energy transition at Baker Hughes (BKR.O).

""Not everything is going to win,"" she said.

A number of executives also blamed the lack of a carbon-pricing measure in the United States, saying that a clear price on carbon would help drive the market to adopt greener solutions.

""I don't feel good about the pace at which we're decarbonizing the power generation supply,"" PSEG's Izzo said. ""We need congressional action to either put a price on carbon or pass the tax credits associated with renewable energy and nuclear power.""

Explained: Two new carbon capture pipelines planned for S.D.,"There are two carbon-capture pipelines planned for South Dakota.

Corn growers and ethanol companies say the projects are good for the economic future of farmers, and good for the environment. But opponents doubt those environmental claims.

Ethanol producers can get more money for their product in states with stricter emission standards by shrinking their carbon footprint.

One way to offset carbon dioxide emitted during ethanol production is to liquefy the carbon and bury it underground. That’s a process known as sequestration. Sequestering carbon keeps it out of the atmosphere, where it traps heat.

To sequester carbon, ethanol companies need pipelines to carry liquified C02 to a sequestration site.

The two pipelines would transport CO2 to Illinois and North Dakota, respectively. Those states have areas with the geological conditions needed for underground sequestration.

Some CO2 emissions are already made into dry ice and other products. But those efforts don't produce meaningful environmental results.

Chris Hill works for Summit Carbon Solutions, which is proposing the Midwest Carbon Express pipeline.

“Ultimately, you’re just delaying the release of that CO2 into the atmosphere from dry ice, or a soda, or in another food or beverage. When you inject it into a geological formation for permanent sequestration, it’s not going to get released back into the atmosphere,” he says.

Ethanol producers would also benefit from a federal tax credit awarding $50 per ton of sequestered CO2. Navigator CO2 Ventures expects its Heartland Greenway pipeline to transport 15 million tons annually.

Proponents say carbon pipelines are necessary to control the greenhouse gases driving climate change. However, some environmental groups are skeptical of carbon capture, arguing it does nothing to address the root causes of pollution.

Some landowners worry that spills from the pipeline could damage soil and water sources, a worry Navigator says it’s addressed.

“The product in this pipeline is carbon dioxide, it’s not a petroleum product. It does not contaminate your water or soil in that capacity. It is a short-term, localized impact,"" says Monica Howard, senior director of environmental regulatory with Navigator.

The company proposing the Heartland Greenway pipeline wants to be operational by 2025. Meanwhile, Summit Carbon Solutions recently received an extension for its permit application.",,[],"['Sdpb Radio', 'Joshua Is The Journalism Team Lead For All Things Digital.', 'Slater Dixon Is A Junior At Augustana University Studying Government', 'Data Science.

What is the circular economy and why does it matter?,"In a circular economy, products can be used again and again.

This reduces our use of precious raw materials and cuts CO2 emissions.

Circular economy initiatives include the Circulars Accelerator, an innovation programme run in collaboration with the World Economic Forum.

The way we live now is using 60% more resources than the Earth can provide - and creating too much waste, according to experts.

Switching to a circular economy is widely considered to be the way forward.

What is the circular economy?

In a circular economy, things are made and consumed in a way that minimizes our use of the world’s resources, cuts waste and reduces carbon emissions. Products are kept in use for as long as possible, through repairing, recycling and redesign – so they can be used again and again.

At the end of a product’s life, the materials used to make it are kept in the economy and reused wherever possible, the European Parliament explains.

The circular economy could unlock $4.5 trillion of value by 2030. Image: European Parliament

Why is the circular economy important?

The circular economy is an alternative to traditional linear economies, where we take resources, make things, consume them and throw them away. This way of living uses up finite raw materials and produces vast quantities of waste.

For example, the European Union produces more than 2.5 billion tonnes of waste a year.

Extracting and processing raw materials impacts the environment and increases energy consumption and CO2 emissions.

A circular economy could unlock $4.5 trillion of value by 2030, a report by Accenture estimated.

What changes could make the world more ‘circular’?

Consumers, businesses and politicians all need to make changes.

Examples are set out in The Circularity Gap Report, an annual document on the state of the circular economy, launched at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting in Davos.

Ideas to create less emissions include adopting a plant-based diet and buying food locally, as well as flying less often and sharing vehicles.

Homes, offices and other buildings can be designed to have multiple uses. For example, an office space that is also a community centre and night school.

It should also be easy and affordable to repair products, such as a mobile phone with an old battery.

Is recycling part of the circular economy?

Recycling involves converting waste materials into new materials and objects. This process itself uses energy and creates emissions, so can still contribute to global warming.

In an ideal circular economy, products are redesigned so they last through several life cycles – rather than being immediately recycled.

This can include refurbishing and redistributing products.

How can we build a circular economy?

There are a growing number of circular economy initiatives and technologies already underway.

Examples include the Circulars Accelerator, a six-month programme run by UpLink, the World Economic Forum’s innovation crowdsourcing platform, to help circular economy innovators scale their ideas. In 2022, 17 start-ups are taking part in the programme.

They include Aquacycl, an American company that generates electricity from untreatable waste water; Done Properly, a company in Chile developing sustainable food ingredients and Green Mining, a company in Brazil that recycles consumer packaging.

Scale360° is another Forum circular economy initiative to help technologists, political leaders and entrepreneurs change how products are made and consumed. In Germany, for instance, a campaign is underway to educate consumers on the environmental impact of ‘white goods’ such as fridges and washing machines.

Other companies driving circular economy innovation include Swedish denim brand, Nudie.

The claim: Volvo data says it takes a decade for electric vehicles to become 'carbon neutral'

The automaker Volvo has committed to selling 100% electric cars by 2030 to slash carbon emissions, the company announced in March.

However, a meme circulating on social media claims that the CO2 emissions from electric vehicle manufacturing significantly limits the benefits of the technology for emissions reductions.

""But then Volvo comes out with data ... that electric cars take a decade to become carbon neutral from there (sic) production pollution,"" reads the May 16 Facebook meme.

The meme garnered nearly 500 interactions in two days.

But the claim is misleading. Electric cars don't become ""carbon neutral,"" since they emit carbon during manufacturing and use – if charged from a grid powered by fossil fuels. ""Carbon neutral"" refers to entities that absorb or otherwise offset their emissions, which isn't the case here.

However, after a certain amount of miles powered by a lower-carbon fuel, EVs ""break even"" with traditional vehicles in terms of carbon emissions. After that time, they produce much less carbon, which results in lower emissions over their lifetime.

The amount of time required for an EV to break even depends on the vehicle model, driving habits and the energy mix used to charge the EV.

USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user who shared the post for comment.

Electric vehicles emit less carbon over lifetime, even when battery production is considered

The meme does not specify what Volvo data it is referencing. However, Volvo has released ""carbon footprint"" assessments for both of its electric vehicles: the C40 Recharge and the XC40 Recharge – an SUV.

The reports compare carbon emissions from the EVs to emissions from the gas-powered version of the XC40.

Though EV manufacturing was found to emit more carbon than a comparable gas-powered vehicle, both reports state that the Volvo EVs produced fewer emissions over the course of their lifetime.

This finding is not limited to Volvo vehicles.

A Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, Jessika Trancik, compared the lifetime carbon emissions of 125 EVs and gas-powered vehicles. Like the Volvo researchers, she found that lifetime carbon emissions from EVs were lower, even when battery production emissions were included.

""The lifecycle emissions of an electric vehicle are typically more than 30% lower than those of a comparable gas-powered car – across most car models and locations,"" she told USA TODAY in an email. ""This difference will increase as the electricity mix decarbonizes.""

The results of the study can be accessed through an online interface called Carbon Counter, which allows users to compare the carbon emissions of different vehicles.

Fact check: EV transition does not require every gas station in the U.S. to go electric

Break-even point depends on vehicle model, energy mix and driver behavior

Despite the claim made in the meme, the Volvo reports don't offer a specific timeframe in which their electric vehicles would break even with a gas vehicle. The reports only provide mileage estimates.

For instance, the C40 Recharge would need to be driven roughly 68,400 miles or less to break even with the gas-powered XC40.

This means that if an American EV user drove 13,500 miles per year – roughly the average according to the Department of Transportation – it would take five years or less to hit the break-even point. (We'll, note though, that the user who posted this claim is in Australia.)

Further, the amount of carbon produced by an EV – and, thus, its break-even timeframe – is heavily influenced by carbon emissions from the electrical grid used to charge it.

For instance, the above-stated break-even mileage for the C40 Recharge – 64,800 miles – assumes that the electricity used to charge the vehicle was generated using around 60% fossil fuels, according to a Volvo press release.

In the C40 Recharge report, Volvo estimated it would only take about 30,500 miles to break even if the vehicle was charged on a grid powered by wind energy. Thus, if the American grid were charged with wind power or a carbon emissions comparable source, break even would take a little more than two years, according to these estimates.

The break-even mileage for the XC40 Recharge is roughly 80,000 miles when the vehicle is charged on a grid with a high percentage of fossil fuels, according to Volvo spokesperson Ben Foulds. (This figure was updated from the original XC40 Recharge report.) That would be about six year of driving for a typical American.

Fact check: Claim on electric car charging efficiency gets some math wrong

Our rating: Missing context

Based on our research, we rate MISSING CONTEXT the claim that Volvo data says it takes a decade for EVs to become ""carbon neutral."" This claim misuses the term ""carbon neutral,"" which refers to storing carbon in a way that offsets carbon emissions. The question addressed in these reports is when EVs break even and then become more carbon-friendly than comparable gas-powered vehicles. The carbon cost of EV manufacturing is higher than a comparable gas-powered vehicle, but the CO2 emissions are lower over the lifetime of the vehicle. Further, there is not a set break-even timeframe for EVs. It depends on driving habits, the vehicle model and the energy mix used to power the EV.

Carbon8 hits £5m funding milestone,"UK carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) specialist Carbon8 has secured a £5m investment to advance deployment of its technology to be used to decarbonise hard-to-abate industrial sectors.

The funding included a co-investment of £4m by international cement group Vicat and energy giant EDF Group and its corporate venture capital arm, EDG Pulse Ventures.

By using its patented Accelerated Carbonation Technology (ACT), Carbon8’s CCUS solution could help reduce emissions in sectors such as cement, Energy from Waste, steel, and paper – industries currently responsible for over 20% of global GHG emissions.

It does this by combining industrial residues with captured CO2 emissions to produce high-value minerals. By plugging in its modular CO2ntainer technology, the company is able to capture carbon from the point source and permanently store it in the output materials of the ACT process.

Commenting on the investment, John Pilkington, CEO, Carbon8, said, “The investment made by EDF and Vicat is hugely valuable as we accelerate the growth of our business, and maximise the positive impacts – capturing carbon, re-using residues – that we can offer to industry.”

The materials produced using the captured CO2 allow companies to play into a circular economy model by utilising the minerals in other industries such as aggregates for construction use and fertilisers.

Carbon8’s technology has previously been deployed at Vicat Group’s Montalieu-Vercieu cement plant near Lyons, France.

“Vice has looked at a number of innovative ideas for reducing its carbon emissions,” commented Laury Barnes-Davin, Scientific and R&D Director, Vicat Group.

“We were drawn to Carbon8’s two-part technology: capturing the CO2 that Montalieu emits and using it to produce an aggregate that can be marketed in the construction industry.”

MOL car carrier conducts carbon offset voyage from Japan to Europe,"June 15, 2022, by Naida Hakirevic Prevljak

One of the car carriers operated by Japanese shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) has completed a carbon offset voyage for the ocean transportation of completed cars from Japan to Europe by using voluntary carbon credits.

Courtesy of MOL

This initiative was conducted as a pilot case to study the specific use of carbon credits in ocean shipping to compensate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which are difficult to reduce using currently available technology.

Completed cars from Mazda Motor Corporation were loaded on the MOL-operated vessel Beluga Ace which departed the Port of Hiroshima on 18 April and arrived at the Port of Bristol, the UK, on 28 May.

CO2 emissions during the voyage between Japan and Europe reached about 4,000 tons including all processes from production through consumption of fuel oil. The calculation method of the volume was properly verified by the third-party verification body Bureau Veritas. The entire process, from calculating CO2 emissions including the verification process to compensating all CO2 emissions with carbon credits, was also certified by the third-party certification body Climate Neutral Commodity.

MOL used carbon credits generated from afforestation and reforestation projects in Ghana and China for this initiative. Both projects are certified by the international carbon credit standard management body Verra and the credits were generated within the past five years.

In addition, these projects contribute not only to absorbing and removing CO2 from the atmosphere but also to several co-benefits such as biodiversity conservation and job creation for local communities, according to MOL.

In March, MOL also confirmed its participation in the carbon offset by using “J Blue Credit” which utilizes the blue carbon issued by Japan Blue Economy Association (JBE).

Carbon-capture to feed startup sets up pilot plant in Denmark,"The pilot unit is located at the Danish Technological Institute (DTU) in Taastrup, Denmark. That institute has secured access to laboratories, facilities, and competencies within the microalgae cultivation area.

The idea is that Algiecel’s container-based photobioreactors, using microalgae organisms, will capture CO2 for conversion into high value commodity products such as omega-3 oils and protein to be used in food and feed products.

Juan Farré, president and CEO of the DTU, said that “the opening [of the pilot facility] marks the establishment by the Danish Technological Institute of an ecosystem giving start-up companies access to an integrated platform of testing and demonstration facilities within the space of future foods and the green transition.”​

In March, we reported that Algiecel had received funding of around £400K (US$525K) from Denmark’s BioInnovation Institute (BII) for the construction and testing of the carbon capture pilot plant.

At the launch of the pilot operations, Jens Nielsen, the CEO of BII, said he was impressed by how quickly Algiecel has advanced to this stage, that it is now initiating experiments at pilot scale. “But speed is unfortunately important as we rapidly need new technologies like the ones Algiecel is providing to make sure that we can create a sustainable society.”​

Mobile solution

The photobioreactor technology is easy to install, scale and operate, said the founder of Algiecel, Henrik Busch-Larsen, in March. He is the former CEO of single cell protein pioneer, Unibio.

As the Algiecel solution has been made mobile it can thus be installed with ease at a biogas or fermentation plant where CO2 emissions, he added. The plan would be to have several such container units installed at the one site to fully capture the carbon emitted.

Revenue-sharing concept

The startup is looking to champion a new revenue-sharing business model to offer carbon capture as a service to industrial clients.

Busch-Larsen said he started Algiecel mid-2021, with the vision of making CO2 removal cost-neutral.

He and the team have designed a business model that looks to transform the cost challenge of CO2 removal and potential emission penalties into a profitable business opportunity across the entire value chain: “Carbon emitters would need to invest in the photobioreactor but, when we start producing omega-3 oils and protein, the revenue from sales of those derivative products will be shared with the clients so, over time, the process would be cost-neutral, with clients, eventually, running a small profit off the back of their CO2 problem.”​",,[],['Jane Byrne']

At the same time, NextEra will leverage its scale and expertise to help its power sector and commercial and industrial customers reduce and, ultimately, eliminate emissions from their own operations.",,[],[]
Sweden’s CO2 emissions displayed live in OOH campaign to promote climate literacy,"Climate tech startups Doconomy and Kayrros have launched ‘The 2030 Forecast,’ a first-of-its-kind initiative that uses outdoor digital displays to show a weekly snapshot of Sweden’s carbon emissions footprint.

It is hoped that ‘2030 Forecast’ will increase the level of transparency and discussion about emissions, and foster a sense of shared responsibility between individuals and corporations to accelerate climate action and halt the climate curve.

The launch of the platform took place during World Environment Day on June 5 2022, with near real-time national emissions data displayed publicly on the streets of Stockholm.

The initiative hopes to track Sweden’s progress toward its 2030 emissions-reduction targets, based on the belief that environmental emissions data should be available to everyone. Doconomy and Kayrros want to raise awareness and promote a sense of collective responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions by tracking progress toward 2030 climate goals on a weekly basis.

Johan Pihl, chief innovation officer at Doconomy, said: “The public deserves to be aware of our actual progress in achieving the emissions reduction goals. It’s the first step in taking action and making the connection between an individual’s carbon footprint and the environmental impact of industrial emissions. At first, the national emission numbers might be difficult to put into direct context, but we are confident they will become familiar and relevant over time. It is the beginning of a learning curve long overdue.”

To create the ‘2030 Forecast’, Doconomy partnered with energy and climate-focused data analytics firm Kayrros, which analyzes satellite images and other data sources to track environmental metrics. Working with the European Space Agency (ESA) and France’s National Centre for Space Studies, Kayrros leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced mathematics to extract timely, actionable signals on greenhouse gas emissions from earth-observation sensors and other sources.

Earlier this year, annual emissions data for 2021 from the European Commission confirmed the accuracy of Kayrros Carbon Watch measurements produced daily over the course of the year, covering CO2e emissions from power plants, industry and domestic air transport.

Antoine Rostand, co-founder and president of Kayrros, added: “We are incredibly excited about this partnership, which brings Kayrros data from the corporate sphere to the consumers’ fingertips.

“Our ability to address climate change collectively and efficiently hinges on the public’s awareness of what makes our footprint bigger or smaller. Climate literacy and data transparency are key to ensuring that we make the right decisions not just in public policy and corporate practices, but also in our everyday life.”

Going forward, news organizations and media platforms are also invited to apply to license and broadcast the live national carbon emissions data as part of a bigger plan to disseminate national emission levels on public channels.",,[],['Ellen Ormesher']
Could steam-powered cars decrease the CO2 in the atmosphere?,"Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskidsus@theconversation.com.

Could steam-powered cars decrease the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere? – Emma, age 16, Springville, Utah

With the growing severity and frequency of storms, heat waves and wildfires, and the other dangers from climate change, there are many reasons to be concerned about the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Scientists have shown that humanity’s addiction to burning fossil fuels is causing this problem, which means it’s time to kick that habit.

Because transportation generates more than one-fourth of the CO2 emitted by burning fossil fuels, slashing CO2 emissions requires phasing out vehicles powered by gasoline, diesel and natural gas.

Steam powered many of the early automobiles sold around 1900. Could the same technology play a role again?

The ‘Stanley Steamer’

The steam-powered car became possible once gasoline and diesel oil replaced wood and coal for the powering of engines.

Inventors Francis and Freelan Stanley, twin brothers, became automaking pioneers after they improved photographic technology. In 1898 and 1899 they were selling more vehicles than any other early automaker, and their steam-powered “Rocket Racer” set a speed record in 1906.

All along, cars powered by internal combustion engines – the kind most in use today – were competing with steam cars and winning the technology war. Starting in 1912, electric starters made them safer and more convenient by replacing dangerous hand cranks. By 1920, when its assembly lines started producing the Model T with an electric starter, Ford was selling hundreds of thousands of cars per year.

In contrast, early steam cars were heavy and expensive, and it took a long time to make enough steam to get them rolling. Doble Steam Motors, another early automaker, eventually solved this last problem and many others, but the cars remained pricey, and it was too late: The noisy and polluting but much cheaper internal combustion engine had won out. The Stanley Motor Carriage Co. ceased operating in 1924.

To be clear, because the heat to boil water to make steam has to come from somewhere, these steam-powered vehicles burned fossil fuels to heat their water anyway.

A 1970s comeback

Steam power had something of a comeback in the 1970s, but not because of climate concerns. Back then, air pollution spewed by vehicles had become a serious problem filling cities with smog.

Steam boilers can burn fuel more thoroughly than a standard internal combustion engine, leading to cleaner exhaust that is mostly water and carbon dioxide.

At the time, that was seen as an improvement.

Some of the cities battling pollution from automobile exhaust added steam-powered buses to their fleets. This resurgence was short-lived because of the arrival of new technologies that could curb pollution from internal combustion engines.

Steam’s drawback and electricity’s advantages

The biggest obstacle for steam-powered vehicles is that steam isn’t a source of energy. Rather, it is a source of power for the wheels.

While getting around in steam-powered vehicles might make the air cleaner in the drivers’ own communities, switching to steam-powered engines that continue to burn gasoline and diesel wouldn’t reduce CO2 emissions.

A different approach can potentially eliminate the need to burn fossil fuels for transportation: replacing gasoline tanks with batteries to provide the energy, along with swapping out internal combustion engines for electric motors to turn the wheels.

The reduction in carbon emissions will be far greater if vehicles run on electricity generated by wind turbines, solar panels or other energy sources that don’t emit carbon dioxide.

As it happens, some of the first cars ever made were electric. Manufacturers stopped making those models because the need to recharge their batteries after short distances rendered those vehicles less convenient than those powered by fossil fuels.

Battery technology is so much better now that some electric vehicles can travel 400 miles (640 kilometers) without needing to recharge. Instead of switching to steam as a source of power to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, we recommend electricity generated from renewable sources.

"2021 broke nearly all climate change indicator records (again), from CO2 emissions to rising sea levels","Four critical indicators of the climate crisis broke records last year, from the levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere to rising oceans, according to a UN report. This is yet another piece of evidence that human activities are causing wide changes on land, in the ocean, and in the atmosphere, with harmful consequences, the UN said.

The UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) found that sea-level rise, ocean heat, ocean acidification, and greenhouse gas concentrations set new records last year. UN head Antonio Guterres said the annual overview is a “dismaying litany of humanity’s failure” to address the climate crisis, also describing the energy system as “broken.”

WMO confirmed that the past seven years were the top seven warmest years on record. The year 2021 was “only” one of the warmest because of back-to-back La Niña events at the start and end of the year. This had a temporary cooling effect. However, the average global temperature last year was 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

“Our climate is changing before our eyes. Human-induced greenhouse gases will warm the planet for many generations to come. Some glaciers have reached the point of no return and this will have long-term repercussions in a world in which more than two billion people already experience water stress,” WMO head Pettteri Taalas, said in a statement.

Indicators of the climate crisis

In its report, WMO addressed four indicators that “build a consistent picture of a warming world” that is affecting the entire planet. First, greenhouse gas concentrations, which reached a global high in 2020. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) was 413.2 parts per million (ppm) globally, 149% over pre-industrial levels.

Preliminary data shows emissions continued to rise in 2021 and early 2022. The Mona Loa observatory registered 413.2 ppm in April 2020, 419.05 ppm in April 2021, and 420.23 ppm in April 2020, the report said. Almost a quarter of the emissions are absorbed by the oceans. This makes them more acidic, threatening overall marine wildlife.

The report also found global mean sea level (GMSL) reached a new record high, rising an average of 4.5 millimeters from 2013 to 2021. This is drastically higher than the 2.1 millimeters per year between 1993 and 2002. For the WMO, this increase happened because of the “accelerated loss of ice mass from the ice sheets.”

Ocean heat also broke a new record last year, exceeding the 2020 value. This is expected to continue in the future, especially in the upper 2,000 meters of the ocean – a change that the WMO described as irreversible on centennial to millennial scales. Ocean heat determines sea temperature and also affects sea level and currents.

Responding to the report’s findings, UN head Guterres proposed a set of actions to accelerate the transition to renewable energy “before it’s too late.” Among them, he suggested tripling investment in renewables, ending fossil fuel subsidies, and making renewable energy technology, such as batteries, freely-available public goods.",,[],"['If You Love Science', 'This Free App Is All You Need.', 'Fermin Koop Is A Reporter Buenos Aires', 'Argentina.

Nature restoration and carbon removal are not the same. Here’s why it matters,"Planting trees is a key pillar in the fight against climate change but it’s no substitute for permanently removing carbon dioxide from the air

By 6 carbon removal and forest experts

Humanity has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, making cement, deforesting land, and degrading soils.

To stop global warming, the world needs to decrease the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by radically reducing CO2 emissions and eventually reaching net zero. Reaching net zero will require a significant amount of carbon removal that needs to be aligned with core physical climate principles.

One popular way to take CO2 out of the atmosphere is restoring nature — for example, growing trees to build back carbon lost from deforestation or restoring carbon in soils. Restoring nature is one of the key pillars in our fight against climate change. However, the CO2 captured by nature is stored in the “biological” or “short” carbon cycle, where the risk of reversal is high. Forests can be cut or burnt down and succumb to diseases or pests. Soils can quickly lose any new carbon stored if the regenerative practices are discontinued.

Fossil carbon and its atmospheric impacts operate on a much longer carbon cycle. Fossil fuels are part of the “long” carbon cycle, and consist of biomass put under pressure for millions of years and stored safely underground. When fossil carbon is released into the atmosphere, the CO2 sticks around for thousands of years.

Because short and long carbon cycle storage have different effects on warming, it is essential to differentiate between these two approaches. They should not be treated as one and the same. So far, however, the term “carbon removal” has been used to both describe methods that capture and temporarily store CO2 in the biosphere and those that permanently store the carbon away.

We suggest a change of vocabulary where the term carbon removal is reserved for methods that take CO2 out of the atmosphere and store it durably away from the short carbon cycle. Restoring previously lost carbon in the short carbon cycle in nature should be seen as a part of nature restoration rather than as stand-alone carbon solutions. A method that only takes CO2 out of the air but not away from the short carbon cycle should not be seen as removing carbon.

The only carbon removals that should be counted as negating CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are those that also store away the carbon for hundreds or thousands of years.

Carbon removal methods would include solutions such as mineralization, direct air capture with geological or mineral storage, and methods that use the biosphere to capture carbon but then store it durably, such as BECCS or woody biomass burial.

This shift would not undercut the essential role of natural climate solutions. Methods that sequester carbon in nature include all methods where the carbon is stored in living biomass or as soil organic content. Examples are reforestation, blue carbon (like restoring mangroves and seagrasses), wetland restoration, and regenerative agriculture to restore soil organic carbon content. In net-zero accounting, carbon stored with these solutions could be used to net out emissions from deforestation and potentially short-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, but not from fossil fuels.

Restoring nature helps to mitigate climate change, but is often as or more valuable for its other contributions. Methods that restore carbon can also increase biodiversity, halt desertification, improve regional climate, increase yields, and create healthier farmland. These solutions should aggressively be pursued, but singularly focusing on carbon can sometimes be harmful. Monoculture plantations harming biodiversity is a stark example.

Carbon removal has been a concept that casts its net too wide. By separating nature restoration from carbon removal, it becomes clearer what a method can be used for and why it should be pursued. This kind of precision is critical to guide early investment and reduce the risk that today’s efforts might unintentionally undermine progress in mitigating climate change.

A new climate fund asks fashion to pay up to reduce carbon emissions,"To materially reduce its total emissions, fashion needs to overhaul the supply chain. That includes implementing initiatives that often come with significant capital costs, such as transitioning factories to renewable energy and investing to scale next-generation materials — yet most brands don’t (publicly) include financial plans in their sustainability strategies and the industry’s voluntary initiatives are increasingly ambitious but rarely come with funding attached.

“What matters to measure in this industry is reducing CO2 emissions. That was the concept for putting together a donor-pooled fund or donor-collaborative funding model, because I had seen them in philanthropy and other sectors. I thought, this is what the fashion industry needs,” says Lewis Perkins, Apparel Impact Institute president.

Perkins says they expect to have other brands join the climate fund, which was announced at this week’s Global Fashion Summit in Copenhagen, by the end of the year, with the goal for each to commit $10 million over eight years. The idea is to build support and funding to tackle the hurdles that the industry faces collectively, such as the persistence of fossil fuels in the supply chain — challenges that all brands need to overcome to meet their sustainability goals, but which few, if any, brands have capacity or incentive to address on their own.

H&M Group has a net-zero emissions goal by 2040, for example, and says it “is constantly on the lookout for investment possibilities” to advance renewable energy and decarbonisation technologies. “But we need to go outside our own abilities and collaborate with competitors, financial institutions and other stakeholders to reach beyond our own supply chain and create industry wide impact,” a spokesperson for the company says. “We believe that the Fashion Climate Fund can identify, fund and scale proven solutions that will lower carbon emissions across the supply chain of the textile, apparel and footwear sector.”

Up to 14% less containership CO2 emissions through Just In Time arrivals,"Containerships can reduce fuel consumption and resulting carbon dioxide emissions by 14% on a per voyage basis using Just In Time (JIT) arrival. It is the first global study into the impact of Just In Time Arrivals using real time tracking and fuel consumption data from container vessels in operation.

Port of Rotterdam has participated in this study by supplying validation data on arrival and departure times. The new study was commissioned by the IMO-Norway GreenVoyage2050’s Global Industry Alliance to Support Low Carbon Shipping (Low Carbon GIA).

Just-In-Time arrivals

Just In Time (JIT) arrivals allow ships to optimise speed during their voyage to arrive in port when berth, fairway and nautical services are available. JIT is an important tool that can contribute to a ship attaining its required carbon intensity indicator (CII) and associated CII rating in accordance with IMO’s short-term GHG reduction measure, which will enter into force later this year. JIT can be taken up, together with other operational measures, in the enhanced Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) which will play a central role in the implementation of IMO’s recent energy efficiency measures.

This latest study, undertaken by MarineTraffic and Energy and Environmental Research Associates (EERA), explores the global implementation of JIT in the container sector. Using AIS data from the calendar year 2019 (pre-pandemic), the impact of JIT on fuel consumption and emissions was assessed by optimizing all voyages in three scenarios:

Over the entire voyage, Over the last 24 hrs, Over the last 12 hrs.

Results

The results show that while optimizing speed over the entire duration of a voyage offers the greatest saving opportunity (displaying a mean fuel saving per voyage of 14.16%), there were benefits in all scenarios with savings of 5.90% (24 hrs scenario) and 4.23% (12 hrs scenario), respectively. This indicates that implementing JIT over the last 12 hours of a voyage can already greatly contribute to fuels and emissions savings.

The Low Carbon GIA is a public-private partnership with the aim to develop innovative solutions to address common barriers to decarbonizing the shipping sector. It has been actively exploring the concept of JIT through various research projects and several industry stakeholder roundtables. In 2020, it published the Just In Time Arrival Guide – Potential Barriers and Solutions, providing guidance to stakeholders towards the implementation of JIT Arrivals.

Offshore Energies UK ‘strongly endorses’ NSTA’s carbon storage licensing round,"Offshore Energies UK ‘strongly endorses’ NSTA’s carbon storage licensing round

6/14/2022

Thirty million tons of CO2 could be permanently stored in rocks deep beneath the UK’s surrounding seas by 2030, under plans announced by the North Sea Transition Authority.

In a move strongly endorsed by Offshore Energies UK it has launched the UK’s first-ever carbon storage licensing round, offering 13 areas of the seabed as potential sites for permanently storing millions of tons of CO2.

They could be among the first of many. The UK will need up to 100 such offshore sites if it is to meet its target of ‘net zero’ by 2050 – meaning it produces no overall greenhouse gas emissions. The UK’s offshore operators and their supply chain companies have five decades of experience in the kind of engineering needed to make such technologies work.

Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) involves the capture of CO2 emissions from burning hydrocarbons such as gas, petrol and oil. At the moment most such CO2 is released into the atmosphere but this risks accelerating harmful processes such as global warming and ocean acidification.

The aim of CCUS is to collect the CO2 before it gets into the air, and then transport it via ships or pipelines to be permanently stored deep underground in geological formations. Developing such technologies was a key element in the 2021 North Sea Transition Deal, under which the offshore energy industry committed to work with the UK government to achieve net zero by 2050.

The hope is that such technologies can play a crucial role in decarbonizing the UK’s major industrial hubs, especially around areas like Teesside, Humberside, Merseyside and on the east coast of Scotland.

The areas being offered for licensing by the NSTA are off the coast of Aberdeen, Teesside, Liverpool and Lincolnshire in the Southern North Sea, Central North Sea, Northern North Sea, and East Irish Sea and are made up of a mixture of depleted oil and gas fields and saline aquifers – porous rock formations filled with salt water.

Will Webster, energy policy manager at OEUK, said CO2 storage technologies could prevent tens of millions of tons of CO2 entering the atmosphere.

“Carbon capture technologies will be a key element in helping the UK reach net zero. It is particularly important for industry, especially heavy industries which need a lot of energy and so produce a lot of CO2,” Webster said. “This applies particularly to the cement and steel industries, petrochemical refineries, and power generation.

“The UK’s oil and gas sector has a highly skilled workforce used to managing and transporting large volumes of gas safely and they will have all the knowledge needed to make this technology work.

“This is a long-term project – we want to be able to store 50 million tons of CO2 a year by 2035 and continue expanding after that. That means we need a long-term commitment from government, a clear regulatory framework, and business models that encourage early investment.”

Keith Wise, operations manager at OEUK, said: “Deploying CCUS will need the same range of skills and experience as the offshore oil and gas industry already possesses. That includes offshore engineering, geological and seismological sciences and many more. We look forward to seeing this emission reduction technology develop as a key part of the UK’s transition to net zero.”

US Department of Energy Invests $3.5bn to Kickstart Carbon Capture Industry,"The US carbon capture industry would directly remove carbon emissions from ambient air and help meet the country’s 2050 net zero emissions target.

—

The US Department of Energy (DOE) has announced a USD$3.5 billion investment in direct air carbon capture technologies, which could help drastically reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere.

Carbon capture or removal refers to negative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions or the process of absorbing and storing carbon durably in another form – often in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs. Carbon capture occurs naturally via carbon sinks like oceans and forests, but they are unable to keep pace with humanity’s rapid growth and emissions from fossil fuels. Even if we stopped burning fossil fuel today, there is still too much carbon in the atmosphere to completely stall global warming.

Direct air capture technologies could help speed things up, and will be “unavoidable” to limit global temperature rise and net zero emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

As the name suggests, direct air capture sees large facilities capture CO2 directly from the ambient air; plants use enormous fans to draw in the air, from which the carbon is then removed using chemicals such as alkaline solvents or sorbents. Following this, the CO2 is isolated through heat and then either sequestered in the ground or utilised for carbon-neutral products like fuels or chemicals.

US President Joe Biden pledged to halve carbon emission by 2030 and to achieve net zero by 2050. Due to political gridlocks in Congress and the war in Ukraine, the country’s decarbonisation process and renewable transition has not progressed far. To diversify climate action, the Biden administration is looking to dramatically scale up direct air removal and the carbon capture industry.

Last week, the DOE released a notice of intent for developers for four direct air capture hubs using $3.5 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law. Each hub must be capable of removing at least a million tons of CO2 per year, which is equivalent to taking 200,000 fossil fuelled-powered vehicles off the road. The hubs also need to be able to permanently store the CO2 and not use the captured CO2 to produce more fossil fuels.

“The UN’s latest climate report made clear that removing legacy carbon pollution from the air through direct air capture and safely storing it is an essential weapon in our fight against the climate crisis,” US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm wrote in the statement. “President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is funding new technologies that will not only make our carbon-free future a reality but will help position the U.S. as a net-zero leader while creating good-paying jobs for a transitioning clean energy workforce.”

The plan is for at least two of the hubs to be located in “economically distressed communities in the regions of the United States with high levels of coal, oil, or natural gas resources.” But the US agency will also be looking for regions with other kinds of heavily polluting industries; allowing projects to share the same pipelines could potentially help cut down costs.

Iceland is currently home to the world’s largest direct air capture plant. Built by Zurich-based Climeworks, the facility removes about 4,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, or 10 metric tons every day – approximately what 500 trees could remove in a year. The captured carbon is then stored underground and turned into stone.

Study: Big Tech companies produce even more carbon emissions by having cash in the bank,"The Carbon Bankroll is a new study from the Climate Safe Lending Network, the Outdoor Policy Outfit, and BankFWD that attempts to quantify the banking industry's role in contributing to carbon emissions and climate change. Specifically, it uses publicly-available corporate financial statements to loosely calculate how much money Big Tech companies have in the bank. In addition to the carbon emitted by these banks in the course of their basic business operations, these banks also lend money to other businesses that either directly or indirectly contribute to climate change. Under the accounting framework established by the World Resources Institute, the report explains, these would qualify as Scope 3 downstream emissions that are technically attributable to the original company's supply chain.

Or, as Bill McKibben explained in The New Yorker:

According to these calculations, Google's carbon emissions, in effect, would have risen a hundred and eleven per cent overnight. Meta's emissions would have increased by a hundred and twelve per cent, and Apple's by sixty-four per cent. For Microsoft in 2021, the report claims, ""the emissions generated by the company's $130 billion in cash and investments were comparable to the cumulative emissions generated by the manufacturing, transporting, and use of every Microsoft product in the world."" Amazon, too, has worked to cut emissions; it plans to run its delivery fleet on electric trucks, for instance. But in 2020, the report claims, its ""$81 billion in cash and financial investments still generated more carbon emissions than emissions generated by the energy Amazon purchased to power all their facilities across the world—its fulfillment centers, data centers, physical stores."" Also according to the report, in 2021, the annual emissions from Netflix's cash would have been ten times larger than what was produced by everyone in the world streaming their programming—which is to say, Netflix and heat.

In other words — most of these companies are actually producing more carbon emissions with the cash they have in the bank than through their direct physical suply chains. From the report:

Despite the highly publicized growth in green and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) offerings from their investment arms, many banks are still major suppliers of capital to carbon-intensive sectors and the fossil fuel industry—providing loans as well as underwriting and issuing bonds to maintain the flow of funds into these sectors. In fact, across the Group of 20 leading industrial and developing nations, banks have $13.8 trillion of exposure to carbon-intensive sectors, which constitutes 19% of on-balance sheet loans. The lending and underwriting of carbon-intensive sectors at this rate generates a massive carbon footprint. The research featured in this report suggests that the average carbon intensity per unit of cash deployed by the US financial sector is 126.03 ktCO2e/billion USD. As context, a typical passenger vehicle emits roughly 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year, meaning that for every $1 billion in cash a bank deploys, it generates comparable emissions to 27,398 vehicles' annual emissions.

The report is careful to point out that its calculations are not without caveats, acknowledging that:

The carbon intensity figures for the asset classes analyzed in this report are conservative estimates that constitute an indicative underestimation of the actual emissions banks generate through their financial services

…while also pointing out that those Scope 3 downstream emissions are actually probably higher once you factor in things like pension plans and insurance.

In other words, the capitalist class's exchange of capital is a major contributor to the climate change caused by the industrialization of capitalism, which is slowly ravaging the planet, costing more capital. Neat!

Carbon and health taxes can bring down emissions and improve diets,"Our food system is broken. Not only do we eat too much junk that’s bad for us, but our food habits cause way too much deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Finding ways to tweak the food system and make it healthier and more sustainable is a major policy challenge for governments around the world. According to a new study, there’s a way to get the best of both worlds and encourage consumers to make healthier, greener choices. But there’s a catch: it uses a mechanism that’s traditionally very unpopular; a tax.

Image credit: Pixabay.

About a third of our greenhouse gas emissions come from the food we eat. Meat accounts for a disproportionate proportion of those emissions, especially red meat. Coincidentally or not, red meat is also bad for you, and research shows that regular consumption of red meat is bad for your health. So in one stroke, if people would reduce their consumption of red meat, their diets would become healthier and more sustainable.

But how do you people them to do this?

Combining the use of carbon and health taxes on food products is one way to go, according to a new study. Researchers found that applying a tax to products that have a high emissions footprint and are also bad for health would maximize the health and climate benefits.

In the UK, for instance, such a tax could reduce the annual greenhouse gas emissions by about 40 megatons of CO2 emissions — a third of what the country needs to do if it wants to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

“To date, governments around the world have been at best hesitant to implement food taxes, with the focus of such tax incentives being mostly to deter the consumption of unhealthy foods to improve personal health and reduce pressures on health services,” Michaela Faccioli, one of the study authors, said in a statement.

Food and climate benefits

Food systems, from production to consumption, currently generate over a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the climate crisis, while unhealthy diets account for one in five deaths globally. That’s why integrated policies that address climate and health aspects of the food system are of vital importance for global health and the climate crisis.

While supply-side initiatives are important, the scale and speed of the transformation needed to achieve health and climate targets require also considering demand-side shifts – from education to regulation and taxation. Some food taxes have been applied in recent years, seeking to improve people’s health through consumption changes.

The study looks at how food policies can alter the purchasing behavior of the public to tackle climate change and people’s diets at the same time. It’s based on a survey with about 6,000 UK respondents, created by a team from the University of Exeter, the University of Reading, and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

The respondents were given a list of common food and drink products, replicating the website of a supermarket, and were asked to indicate their typical weekly purchases. Then, subsequent questions showed the same range of products but with new prices or different product information to simulate the effect of food taxes and the provision of health and climate data.

Every time a new policy was introduced, such as a food tax, the respondents could review their food choices. The change in responses was used by the researchers to estimate the effect of the different policies on food purchase behavior and on greenhouse gas emissions and dietary quality. As it turns out, food taxes proved to be an efficient tool and should be something that policymakers strongly consider. In some cases, at least, taxes can actually be good for you.

“The addition of a carbon element to any food tax could create a win-win in which both health and environmental concerns could be addressed. While there is a cost of living crisis and governments may be more hesitant than ever to use fiscal measures, the consequences of inaction could be even more costly,” Cherry Law, a study author, said in a statement.

"A fine spatial resolution modeling of urban carbon emissions: a case study of Shanghai, China","Changing patterns of CEs

The total CEs in Shanghai increased by 64% from 112.36 to 183.75 Mt, 2000–2015, with a 50% and 331% increase in the population and GDP, respectively (Fig. 2a). The GDP growth rate gradually decreased from 12 to 7.98% during 2000–2015. Similarly, the rate of increase of total CEs decreased from 5.12 to 2.12%. The population growth rate increased from 3.28 to 3.99% from 2000 to 2009 and then dropped to 1.5% from 2009 to 2015 (Fig. 2a). Typically, the GDP growth rate increases faster than the CEs growth rate. A relative decoupling of CEs and GDP can be observed, and this decoupling gradually strengthens (Fig. 2a). In this study, the total CEs comprised of three parts: industrial, tertiary, and residential consumption (household consumption) (Fig. 2b). Industrial CEs increased from 95.9 million tons to 135.58 million tons, but its percentage decreased from 85.35 to 73.79% during 2000–2015. The residential CEs increased from 11.46 to 18.14%. The total CEs dropped significantly in 2009 owing to a decrease in industrial CEs. In 2009, industrial CEs decreased by more than 15%, likely because of the global financial crisis in 200845. The global financial crisis triggered a global recession, which had an impact on the economy in Shanghai as well. The total CEs decreased by 11.56%, and the average growth rate of industrial CEs was 1.60% during 2009–2015, mainly due to the global financial crisis.

Changes in the spatial pattern of CEs

Figure 3 shows CEs from tertiary, residential, industrial sectors, from 2000 to 2015. And Fig. 4 shows the total CEs of Shanghai from 2000–2015. CEI increased in the city center area from 2000 to 2005, with the highest CEI increasing from 0.62 to 0.66 Mt/km2 (Fig. 4). However, a turning point appeared in 2005, when the CEI was reduced with the expansion of urban areas. In 2015, CEI continued to decrease. In spite of the decreasing CEI in the city center, we take the area within 10 km of Shanghai People's Square as the center of the city. The total CEs increased by 39.75 million tons from 2005 to 2015, and city expand 476 km2. In contrast, the CEI of the non-city center area increased significantly from 2005 to 2015. Thus, we concluded that urban expansion and industrial relocation together reduced the CEI in the urban center, mainly due to the shift of industrial enterprises from urban center to urban suburbs. However, total CEs continued to increase.

To analyze the change in spatial patterns of CEs between 2000 and 2015, we applied the city center as the center of circle, then we drew multi buffer zones for each 10 km and counted the CEs within each buffer zone (Fig. 5a). From 2000 to 2015, the total CEs increased to 50.79 Mt (1.76%) in the city center (within 10 km). However, a remarkable increase (75.81%) was observed in peri-urban areas (distance to the city center between 10 and 20 km, Fig. 5e). Moreover, CEs increased rapidly in the suburbs (the regions which distance to the city center from 20 to 70 km). This indicates that human activities spread towards peri-urban areas with urban expansion. When examining industrial CEs, we found that CEs significantly reduced (41.05%) in the city center areas. We also observed an increase (19.12 Mt, 138.09%) in the suburbs (distance to the city center from 20 to 30 km) from 2000 to 2015 (Fig. 5c). Additionally, industrial CEs in the areas between 30 and 70 km from the urban center generally increased rapidly (Fig. 5c). This could be explained by industrial transfer, where in the industries were moved to peri-urban areas of Shanghai and other provinces46. During the “Twelfth Five-Year Plan” period, due to the continuous increase in land and labor costs, tertiary costs, the pressure of resources, environment, and the transformation of its economy and industrial structure, industries shifted to the suburbs of Shanghai and nearby cities to achieve a cross-regional industrial division of labor. This trend is becoming increasingly apparent (http://www.shanghai.gov.cn). In addition, industrial transfer was mainly associated with high energy consuming factories, whereas labor-intensive factories remained in the city center of Shanghai, such as iron and steel enterprises. Thus, while the CEs increased in non-city center areas, they decreased in the city center areas (http://www.shanghai.gov.cn). Interestingly, the residential CEs increased in both the city center and its surrounding areas, particularly in the western part of the city center (Fig. 5d). The largest increase (8.70 Mt) in residential CEs was observed in peri-urban areas (distance to the city center from 10 to 20 km), followed by the city center areas (7.67 Mt). There was a rapid increase in the suburbs situated at a distance of 30–70 km from the center. This clearly indicates that CEs increased with urban expansion between 2000 and 2015. In addition, compared to 2000, population density and human activity intensity also increased in the city center. The CEs from the tertiary sector mainly increased in the city center (5.75 Mt) at a rate of 204.58% (Fig. 5b), primarily as the tertiary sector located in the city center and the intensity of tertiary activity has increased. In addition, the suburbs (distance to the center from 50 to 60 km) showed the fastest growth, followed by the areas located 30 to 40 km from the center.

The intensity of CEs is increasing from urban centers to suburbs, and the spatial distribution area of CEs has increased significantly. This is due to industrial transfer and economic transformation and upgrading. The analysis of the urban spatial morphology (Table 2) shows that from 2000 to 2015, the spatial distribution of the city increased in connectivity, agglomeration, they indicate that Shanghai is more compact. The spatial characteristics of CEs are consistent with the urban form. Compact cities are conducive to the development of public transportation and change people's travel behavior, thereby reducing carbon emissions47,48. Moreover, reasonable land use and functional allocation can effectively reduce carbon emissions.

Accuracy evaluation

In order to evaluate the accuracy of CEs estimation under this study (POI-based CEs), we used CEs obtained by the NTL-based model method (NTL-based CEs), which maps CEs based on statistical model and NTL data, and then compared to POI-based CEs (Fig. 6). There is a lack of fine-resolution spatial data on CEs, even though satellite platforms such as GOSAT directly observe CEs. The NTL-based model is a good method for mapping CEs at the regional scale, with a resolution of 1 km. The NTL-based CE was produced according to Meng42 and employed as a standard for assessing CEs in this study. The resolutions of POI-based CEs and NTL-based CEs are 30 m and 1 km, respectively. We employed 1 × 1 km grids to extract CEs from the two methods, and then mapped them using a scatterplot, as shown in Fig. 6. Also, it is a external validation base on traditional NTL downscaling method.

Figure 6 The scatterplot of carbon dioxide emissions by the traditional method (based on NTL data) and this study (based on POI data). Full size image

The results shown that more than 31.6% of the pixel values based on this study method are higher than those based on the traditional NTL method. The highest value in NTL-based CEs was 122.49 kt. We set the low range as 0–30% of the highest value, which from 0 to 36.75 kt. Moreover, the high range is 80–100% of the highest value, which between 85.75 and 122.49 kt. According to Fig. 6, there are more than 40.89% of the total pixels in the low range, the values of NTL-based CEs were larger than POI-based. Additionally, in the high range, more than 15.20% of the total pixels’ value of POI-based CEs larger than NTL-based. These results indicate that the NTL-based method underestimated CEs in the high range and overestimated CEs in the low range, compare to the POI-based method, which may be caused by the spillover and saturation effects of NTL data.

Figure 7 compares the spatial distribution of CEs based on this study method and traditional method (based on NTL) in 2010 (Fig. 7a–c). There is clearly to known that distribution area of CEs based on the traditional method is significantly larger than that based on this study method. (Fig. 7a,b). The reason is the overflow effect and resolution of NTL data. Moreover, the distribution area of CEs base on this study (POI-based) is close to urban area which extracted from land use data. Because of the CEs mapping method in this study uses urban extent from land use data to correct the distribution extent of CEs. CEs base on this study are higher than those based on traditional method in the inner city, while the opposite is true in the suburbs. (Fig. 7d). This indicating that the traditional NTL-based method underestimates CEs in high emissions areas and overestimates CEs in low emission areas, compare to POI-based method.

We compared the CEs distribution of NTL-based and POI-based method, the CEs distribution of POI-based was found to have more details and fine resolution. Additionally, the heterogeneity of CEs distribution in the three sectors could be assessed at a fine resolution (Fig. 8). The spatial distribution range and characteristics of industrial (Fig. 8d), tertiary (Fig. 8e), and residential (Fig. 8f) CEs based on traditional method are similar and consistent with the NTL data. In contrast, the spatial patterns of CEs by POI-based is different from each sector, and the spatial heterogeneity of CEs for each sector could be accurately assessed (Fig. 8a–c). This is impossible with traditional methods.

(a–c) are the spatial CEs estimated by POI method, and (d–f) are the spatial CEs estimated by NTL method, and for industrial, teritary, and residential sectors respectively (created by QGIS version g 3.24.2 https://www.qgis.org/en/site/, Shanghai boundary map obtained from Resource and Environment Science and Data Center https://www.resdc.cn/Default.aspx).

To verify accuracy of CEs by POI-based method, we employed a sampling line (see Fig. 9a) to extract CEs for the two methods, and compared the values (see Fig. 9b). It is worth noting that Baosteel, a steel factory in Shanghai, which is a high emission source, is located at the sampling line. The POI-based CEs (this study) correctly showed a sudden change and reflected the associated emissions, but the NTL-based method not significant (Fig. 9b). In addition, the CEs of NTL-based is a smooth data line compare to CEs of POI-based. The latter has significant difference, this basically consistent with facts. Because of the sampling line passes through the built-up areas and farmland, so the CEs are striking differences.",,[],"['Huang', 'School Of Forestry', 'Jiangxi Agricultural University', 'Nanchang', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory For Urban Ecological Processes', 'Eco-Restoration', 'School Of Ecological', 'Environmental Sciences', 'East China Normal University', 'Shanghai']"

California releases draft blueprint to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045,"Companies Stoel Rives LLP

June 14, 2022 - After more than 15 public workshops and meetings, starting in June 2021, the California Air Resources Board (ARB) has released the draft 2022 Scoping Plan Update. The update lays out a proposed plan for the state to achieve carbon neutrality across all sectors by 2045 and assesses progress towards meeting the interim statutory mandate of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. ARB anticipates finalizing the Scoping Plan Update by the end of the year.

The 2022 Scoping Plan Update is the third update to ARB's original 2008 Scoping Plan, the original blueprint for achieving the goals of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 or Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32). The update this year is in line with AB 32's statutory requirements for ARB to update at least once every five years ""its plan for achieving the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective reductions"" of GHG emissions. Under AB 32, ARB is the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of GHGs in order to reduce those emissions.

Landmark regulatory programs in California, such as the state's cap and trade program and the low carbon fuel standard, have been enacted or strengthened under AB 32's mandate and later-enacted sister legislation extending the reach of the 2006 statute. A dozen states in the U.S. also now have GHG reduction goals or mandates, either by statute or executive action, with several also aiming for carbon neutrality.

The draft 2022 Scoping Plan Update builds on the last update prepared in 2017, analyzing emissions reductions necessary in the electricity, transportation, industrial, and building sectors. It also departs from the 2017 update to flesh out strategies for reductions in short-lived climate pollutants and implementing carbon dioxide (CO2) removal. The draft update outlines the role of expanding existing programs, notes new legislative and executive mandates to be implemented, and previews the development of new regulations.

The draft 2022 update outlines the four alternative scenarios evaluated to reach carbon neutrality, and details the scenario that ARB staff believes will best achieve a balance of cost-effectiveness, health benefits, and technological feasibility. The draft update states that various principles informed ARB's approach, including ensuring economic resilience, partnering with the private sector, engaging with other governments, and supporting and investing in innovation as well as heathy and resilient natural and working lands (NWL).

ARB also notes that centering equity was a principal consideration and explains the role of the Environmental Justice Advisory Committee in advising ARB in the development of the update, as required under AB 32. The draft update places the proposed scenario in the context of the wildfires, drought, and extreme heat that California has recently suffered, and which from ARB's perspective necessitate the economy-wide transformation to reach carbon neutrality.

Sector by sector transformation

The electricity and building sectors will see the least dramatic shifts under the draft update's proposed scenario. In the electricity sector, the state's existing Renewable Portfolio Standard, revised in 2018 with Senate Bill (SB) 100, already requires California to provide 100 percent of its retail sales of electricity from renewable and zero-carbon resources by 2045. Under SB 350 (2015), the state will double statewide energy efficiency savings in electricity and natural gas end uses by 2030.

The building sector would also rely on a range of existing programs, from requiring new solar on existing homes to implementing renewable natural gas procurement targets under SB 1440 (2018). Various new incentives and programs are also recommended for these sectors, however. One concrete proposal is the Equitable Building Decarbonization program, with funding of $622.4 million over two years under the proposed fiscal year 2022-2023 budget, up for adoption by the California Legislature this summer.

More fundamental transformations are planned for the decarbonization of the transportation and industrial sectors. The draft update contemplates the replacement of gaseous fossil fuels used in industrial processes with zero-carbon electricity, solar thermal heat, hydrogen, and biogas and biomethane.

In the transportation sector, vehicles would transition to zero emission technology through existing and forthcoming programs targeting new light- and medium-duty vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, and fleets under the Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Advanced Clean Fleets regulations. Executive Order N-79-20, issued in 2020, already contemplates 100 percent of sales of new light-duty vehicles will be zero-emission vehicles by 2035, but other aspects of the transportation sector are also targeted.

Overall, the draft update anticipates a reduction in petroleum use by 91 percent in 2045 from 2022 levels. With this transition, the draft plan contemplates a phase-down in oil and gas production by 2045 to match the reduction in demand for in-state petroleum fuels, which ARB estimates would reduce approximately 85 percent of GHG emissions from the oil and gas production sector. A phase-down of petroleum refining is assumed to occur in line with the reduction in finished fuels from petroleum — a reduction of approximately 83 percent relative to 2020 levels.

A new role for carbon removal

One addition in the 2022 Scoping Plan Update is the reliance on carbon dioxide removal and sequestration to handle ""residual emissions"" across all sectors. The 2022 update does not rely solely on traditional sequestration strategies, like natural and working lands management, to meet removal and sequestration targets. Mechanical removal through direct air capture and bioenergy with carbon capture and geologic sequestration (CCS) is contemplated. CCS to capture emissions from other industrial facilities is expected to continue as a strategy as well.

ARB is planning for roughly 180 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent (MMTCO2e) of residual emissions per year in 2035 and around 95 MMTCO2e per year in 2045. To reach carbon neutrality in 2045 with the help of CO2 removal, ARB is aiming for 1-2 MMTCO2e in annual removals from nature-based and mechanical methods in 2030 and ramping up removals by 30 to 40 percent on average each year until 2045.

The 2017 Scoping Plan Update targeted NWL as a carbon sink, with net zero or negative GHG emissions and an initial goal of sequestering and avoiding emissions from NWL by at least 15-20 MMT by 2030. NWL are expected to be a net emissions source in the draft 2022 update, however, acknowledging that NWL sinks and sources are highly variable from year to year. The 2022 update does seek to slow the rate of emissions from NWL, from approximately 9 MMTCO2e per year to 8 MMTCO2e annually.

Finally, the draft update anticipates more aggressive action to realize legislative targets to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, including a 40 percent reduction in methane and hydrofluorocarbon gas emissions, a 50 percent reduction in anthropogenic black carbon emissions, and a 75 percent reduction in organic waste disposal. ARB outlines 27 different strategies for reductions from the sources of these short-lived climate pollutants. The draft update notes that the state first focused on voluntary, incentive-based mechanisms to reduce these emissions, and incentives will be replaced with requirements as solutions become increasingly feasible and cost-effective.

Overall, some sectors may not see dramatic regulatory shifts in the run up to meeting targeted GHG reductions by 2030, as existing programs implemented since the 2017 Scoping Plan Update continue in place. But the emissions reductions necessary to move toward carbon neutrality by 2045 will, in the words of ARB, be ""comprehensive, far reaching, and transformative."" The effects are likely to be felt across all sectors of the state's economy.

Comments on the draft 2022 Scoping Plan Update can be submitted to ARB until June 24. ARB will hold a public meeting to consider the draft update on June 23, 2022, continuing to June 24, 2022, if necessary.

Canada unveils carbon emissions offset market,"Canada's Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault, pictured here at a UN climate conference in November 2021, unveiled Wednesday a national carbon emissions market.

Canada unveiled Wednesday a national carbon emissions market to help it meet its climate goals by allowing cities, farmers and others to sell credits for CO 2 reductions to heavier polluters.

Under the system, registered participants can generate one credit for each tonne of emissions they reduce or remove from the atmosphere.

Credits can then be sold to others in Canada to help them meet compliance obligations or emissions reductions goals.

""This system gives foresters, farmers, Indigenous communities, municipalities and others an opportunity to earn revenues by cutting pollution,"" Environment Minister Stephen Guilbeault told a news conference.

Some environmental groups, however, called it a step backwards in the fight against climate change.

""Offsets don't stop carbon from entering the atmosphere and warming the planet, but on paper they make the big polluters look good,"" Greenpeace's Salome Sane said in a statement.

Ottawa has pledged to reduce Canada's carbon emissions by up to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

But several independent reports have said the government is not doing enough to reach that target, and is lagging behind its G7 counterparts in slashing emissions.

Its new offset credit system, which allows credits to be generated from projects started after January 1, 2017, would allow landfills to sell credits for captured methane, for example.

Farmers could generate credits by sequestering more carbon in their soil by alternating fields in which they plant crops, or using feed for livestock that produces less burped gasses, while forestry firms could do the same by thinning diseased trees and managing brush to reduce wildfires.

""You can't just go out and plant a tree in your front yard and get a credit,"" an official told a briefing.

The emissions cuts must be new, verifiable, and permanent to qualify under the program, which will also include direct carbon capture from the air once those details are hammered out.

The federal system also prohibits trading of duplicate credits. The province of Quebec, for example, is already part of the US state of California's cap and trade system known as the Western Climate Initiative.

These 3 smartphone apps are helping to reduce food waste around the globe. Here’s how,"931 million tonnes of food is wasted every year, contributing between 8% and 10% of global carbon emissions, the UN Environment Programme estimates.

These smartphone apps are helping shoppers, grocery stores, restaurants and food manufacturers cut their food waste.

Governments are increasingly introducing policies to tackle food waste, which costs the world $1 trillion a year.

Food waste is a mounting problem globally. About a third of the world’s food is wasted or lost, according to the WWF, with huge impacts for people, the planet and the economy.

More than 800 million people go to bed hungry every night, according to the World Food Programme.

And the 931 million tonnes of food that’s wasted every year creates between 8% and 10% of global carbon emissions, the UN Environment Programme estimates.

So what can be done to tackle this issue? Technology is one solution. Around the world, smartphone apps are encouraging people to shift their approach to food waste. Here are three of them.

1. Half-price food at a click

In Egypt, an app called Tekeya lets bakeries, restaurants, grocery stores and dessert shops sell their fresh unsold food at half price. It means bargain food for shoppers, who use Tekeya’s free app to browse and buy discounted food near them.

It also means more profit for the shops and restaurants, by increasing their sales and reducing waste processing costs. Tekeya users can also use the app to donate free meals to charities.

In 2021, Tekeya says it managed to save around 40,000 meals, which is equivalent to 85 tonnes of CO2.

2. Surplus food scooped up

In the United Kingdom, a similar app called Too Good To Go lets shoppers buy and collect surplus food at discounted prices from local restaurants, bakeries, grocery stores and food manufacturers.

Food is sold in mixed bags. “You won’t know exactly what’s in your order until you pick it up - it’s all part of the surprise,” the company says.

More than 20,000 food outlets are using the app to cut their food waste and almost nine million shoppers are using the app to buy discounted food, with 12 million bags of food saved from going to waste so far, Too Good To Go says.

Run by Mette Lykke, a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader, the company is also trying to educate people on the difference between ‘best before’ and ‘use by’ labels on food, to prevent unnecessary wastage.

3. Neighbourhood food sharing

Olio is a free app that lets you share food with your neighbours, instead of wasting it. This might be food that needs to be eaten before a holiday or leftover catering supplies, for example. Edible food that’s within its ‘use by’ date can be shared.

App users post a photo and details of food they don’t need, and can also browse other listings. Olio says almost 6 million people in more than 60 countries have so far used its app to share more than 52 million portions of food.

What else can we do about food waste?

Not buying too much food is one way we can all reduce food waste, suggests BBC Good Food. Only buy what you can eat before the use-by expiry date, it suggests.

The BBC also advises that leftover food can be used to make new dishes. For example, using old bread to make a breadcrumb topping.

With food waste globally costing $1 trillion a year, governments are starting to take action, according to Winnow Solutions, a technology company that helps commercial kitchens cut food waste.

For example, in 2018, Australia pledged to halve its food waste by 2030. Funding food rescue charities was a key part of its policy.

In France, new laws have been introduced to reduce food waste. These include mandatory recycling for any business producing more than 10 tonnes of organic waste a year.

And in South Korea, food waste in the capital Seoul fell 10% – 300 tonnes of food a day – over four years after a new policy was introduced to charge homes for recycling based on how much food they throw out.",,[],"['Victoria Masterson', 'Written By', 'Cristen Hemingway', 'Jaynes', 'Nancy Brown', 'Theresa Lieb', 'United Nations']"
First on CNN: DOE announces multibillion-dollar project to kickstart a carbon dioxide removal industry in US,"(CNN) The US Department of Energy is announcing a massive investment in direct air carbon removal projects , in hopes of kickstarting an industry that energy experts say is critical to getting the country's planet-warming emissions under control.

Direct air carbon removal projects are like giant vacuum cleaners that suck planet-warming carbon dioxide out of the air and lock it away. They use chemicals to remove the gas from the air and store it in rocks deep underground or put it to use in materials like concrete.

Nature can do this on its own -- forests, bogs and oceans all suck carbon out of the atmosphere -- but not nearly fast enough to keep pace with human fossil fuel emissions . Experts tell CNN these giant, carbon-removing machines are the next frontier to bring CO2 levels down.

The Department of Energy on Thursday is releasing a notice of intent for developers for four direct air capture hubs -- each capable of removing over a million tons of CO2 per year -- using $3.5 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law. Removing 1 million tons of CO2 per year is equivalent to taking around 200,000 gas-powered cars off the road.

""The UN's latest climate report made clear that removing legacy carbon pollution from the air through direct air capture and safely storing it is an essential weapon in our fight against the climate crisis,"" Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said in a statement. Granholm said the infrastructure law funding ""will not only make our carbon-free future a reality but will help position the U.S. as a net-zero leader.""

Department officials say the notice, which was shared first with CNN, is a crucial step in building this industry in the US.

""For us to get to millions of tons [removed from the air] per year through these demonstrations will be critical,"" said Jen Wilcox, principal deputy assistant secretary in DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management.

President Joe Biden is targeting net-zero carbon emissions in the US by 2050, but experts say that isn't achievable by simply transitioning from fossil fuel energy to renewables -- the country must also actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere because of how much it has already emitted.

Pods containing technology for storing carbon dioxide underground at the Iceland carbon removal site.

Direct air removal ""is a suite of tech and strategies to get to this multi-gigaton carbon removal scale we need to get to in roughly 25-30 years,"" said John Larsen, a partner at the nonpartisan firm Rhodium Group.

The US needs to decarbonize and to dramatically scale up direct air removal, Larsen said, to the point that these machines can remove not millions but billions of tons of CO2 per year. A billion tons of CO2 removed in a year would be equivalent to taking over 215 million vehicles off the road.

Climeworks' direct air removal project in Iceland is the largest, according to the company, removing about 10 metric tons of CO2 every day -- about the same amount of carbon that 500 trees could remove in a year.

The US hubs envisioned by DOE will be much larger. Humans have not yet built a megaton-sized direct air removal system, Larsen said, and DOE's hubs are an important first step to both dramatically scale these projects up and to find out what works and what doesn't.

""What you're really building is an entire carbon removal industry,"" Larsen said. ""The chances of getting to gigaton scale go down dramatically if we don't start this decade. It's way, way harder.""

A fast-moving timeline

The momentum is growing quickly for direct air removal. Before 2018, the amount of money going to these projects in the US was miniscule -- about $11 million per year. The $3.5 billion Congress recently passed for carbon removal, as part of the bipartisan infrastructure law, is a significant increase in funding.

""There's a huge emphasis around carbon removal as a critical tool that needs to be scaled up today,"" Wilcox said. ""We're definitely going to see the needle move in this space over the next 5-10 years.""

DOE said it wants to see applications from different regions in the US that can demonstrate a high potential for carbon sequestration, can be scaled up even further and can create long-lasting jobs. It's also looking for applications from fossil fuel communities or communities with industrial capacity.

DOE officials are also aiming to create hubs that are themselves carbon neutral. For instance, the Iceland project runs on clean geothermal energy.

""Thinking about places where you're going to integrate these with other decarbonization efforts are really important,"" said Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, an organization focused on carbon removal. ""We want to see these powered by zero-carbon energy, by renewables. It's essential for climate that this does not slow down or delay mitigation in any way.""",,[],['Ella Nilsen']
Olympus to Use 100% Renewable Electricity,"Olympus Corporation announces that from April 2022, the company has begun to exclusively source 100% of the electricity used at its major R&D and manufacturing sites in Japan from renewable sources. As a result, CO2 emissions from Olympus Group facilities in Japan will be reduced by approximately 40,000 tons per year. The percentage of the Olympus Group's total electricity use in fiscal 2023 (ending March 2023) from renewable energy sources is expected to substantially increase from approximately 14% in the previous fiscal year to approximately 70%.

Olympus has set a goal of achieving net zero CO2 emissions from its site operations by 2030, as part of its commitment to achieving environmentally responsible business growth and creating a sustainable society. This is a key goal in line with Olympus Corporation's ESG materiality targets focused on the theme of a ""carbon neutral society and circular economy.""

The company has already introduced a wide range of initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions.

[Explainer] What are carbon sinks?,"Carbon sinks are places and/or products that sequester and store carbon.

The ocean, which is by far the largest carbon reservoir and sink, stores carbon in several different forms. The most abundant form is as dissolved inorganic carbon.

Currently, India’s goal under the Paris Agreement is set at creating an additional 2.5–3 bilion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.

Carbon sinks are places and/or products that sequester and store carbon as organic or inorganic compounds for different periods of time. Essentially, anything that absorbs more carbon than it emits into the atmosphere through natural or artificial processes can be considered a carbon sink.

In the pre-industrial era, carbon emitted into the atmosphere was usually balanced – on a global scale – by the accumulation of carbon in terrestrial and oceanic systems known as carbon sinks.

But since humans began using fossil fuels to power industrialisation in the 1960s, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels in the atmosphere have risen by nearly 100 ppm (parts per million) to reach a record high of 400 ppm due to rapidly multiplying carbon sources. Carbon sources are places and processes that release carbon into the atmosphere (mostly in the form of carbon dioxide, particulate carbon, and methane). These include burning fossil fuels, intensive agriculture, and raising livestock, which are leading to large scale climate changes including global warming and extreme weather phenomena.

What are natural and artificial carbon sinks?

Natural carbon sinks can be terrestrial – soil, forests, and grasslands – or aquatic, namely, the ocean. Currently, the oceans are the largest carbon reservoirs in the world.

Artificial carbon sinks, meanwhile, have been proposed to combat the rising levels of carbon in the atmosphere. One such idea is to convert rapidly growing urban areas into carbon sinks by using engineered timber instead of cement, steel, and other such materials. This approach aims to not only create new carbon sinks, but to also simultaneously lower carbon emissions by reducing the demand for cement, since cement manufacture currently contributes to 8% of global CO 2 emissions.

Another idea for an artificial carbon sink is to capture CO 2 directly from air or point sources (such as factories/industrial areas) and create a concentrated stream of CO 2 for use in the production of carbon neutral fuels or carbon sequestration using various methods. Carbon sequestration methods can involve injecting CO 2 into the ocean or into geologic formations.

Since 1996, deep saline aquifers in the Sleipner natural gas field in Norway have been used as storage areas for CO 2 by the Norwegian oil company Equinor, which initiated the project to avoid paying carbon taxes. However, problems with pumping CO 2 into the ocean are many, and recent investigations into leaks in the Sleipner storage sites indicate that geologic storage solutions for CO 2 are also quite problematic.

Mineral sequestration of CO 2 is another carbon capture method that is being explored to create carbon sinks. In this, the carbon is trapped in the form of solid carbonate compounds in sandstone and basalt. Ongoing research projects are also investigating the potential of using mining waste for CO 2 sequestration.

How do oceans act as carbon sinks?

The ocean, which is by far the largest carbon reservoir and sink, stores carbon in several different forms.

The most abundant form is as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). This entered the seas over millennia through sea water interacting with sediments, land weathering, outgassing from the Earth’s interior (for example, through volcanic vents), and gas exchange with the atmosphere. The CO 2 usually dissolves in seawater, where it exists as CO 2 , bicarbonate ions (HCO 3 –), and carbonate ions (CO 3 –).

The intermediate and deep ocean is estimated to be the largest of the five carbon reservoirs in the ocean, the other four being the surface ocean, marine biota, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sea surface sediments.

Oceans also act as carbon sinks due to that actions of biological carbon pumps, which occur mainly in the surface layers of the ocean. Phytoplankton convert CO 2 from the air and dissolved CO 2 in seawater into biomass through photosynthesis. About 25% of this is particulate organic carbon (POC) that sinks through the water column. Most of the sinking POC is remineralised by microbes and less than 1% of the POC reaches the ocean floor by sedimentation to contribute to the carbon sink in the ocean floor.

Marine biota also produce DOC or dissolved organic carbon, which differs from POC in particle size (DOC particles are considerable smaller than POC particles). Due to their small size, DOC particles do not sink, but remain suspended in surface waters, where they feed the classical food chain by serving as nutrients for microbes at the lowest trophic levels. In addition to DOC and POC, calcium carbonate in the form of calcite or aragonite, formed by shell/skeleton producing marine organisms, is an important biotic carbon sink.

In 2019, it was estimated that the oceans absorbed 30% of the atmospheric CO 2 emissions caused by human activity between 1994 and 2007. A recent study in 2020 further shows that the oceans continue to act as a sink for ~25% of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions.

However, this increased CO 2 uptake by oceans may not last, as they are not infinite carbon sinks. As more CO 2 enters the ocean, the changes in the ratios of dissolved CO 2 , HCO 3 –, and CO 3 – ions affect the buffering capacity of the seawater. This means that as the DIC levels in the ocean rise, the capacity of seawater to absorb anthropogenic CO 2 emissions will become lower. In addition, the oceanic carbon sink strengths may also change due to decadal variations and climate change scenarios.

Although ideas to increase carbon sequestration in oceans via the biological carbon pump by encouraging plankton growth (by adding nutrients like iron, nitrates and phosphates) have been proposed, not much is known about the unintended negative effects of this approach. So far, the increased CO 2 levels in the oceans have already reduced seawater pH causing ‘ocean acidification’. Predictions of this trend indicate that by 2050, seawater pH may fall by 0.4–0.5 units to as low as 7.7–7.8. This acidification, coupled with global warming, increases the solubility of calcium carbonate in seawater and is severely impacting the survival of corals, shelled molluscs, and fish.

How do terrestrial systems act as carbon sinks?

Terrestrial systems – vegetation, soil, permafrost, and fossil fuel reserves – are important carbon reservoirs, though their carbon stocks are an order of magnitude lower than those of the oceans. Plant life fixes CO 2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and traps carbon in organic molecules that are then stored in these reservoirs.

Forests have absorbed roughly 20–30% of the global CO 2 emissions between 2001 and 2010. Between 2001 and 2019, forests have absorbed roughly 7.6 gigatons of CO 2 per year; the forests in the Amazon and the Congo river basins have been the strongest carbon sinks during this time. However, the increased growth of forests due to higher CO 2 levels, which causes trees to grow faster, may also shorten their lifespans. This means that forest carbon stocks may be more transient than expected, as trees will begin dying earlier, which will release the sequestered carbon back into the atmosphere.

In addition to forests, grasslands and peatlands are also considered important terrestrial carbon sinks. Both areas have the potential to absorb and store large amounts of carbon as living vegetation biomass and soil organic matter. At one time, managed grasslands were thought to function as perpetual carbon sinks; however, closer examination of the data indicates that this may not be so. Additionally, a study in 2021 suggests that the climate warming effects of managed grasslands may actually cancel the cooling effects of sparsely grazed natural grasslands that act as carbon sinks.

Peatlands are considered to be the most space-efficient terrestrial carbon storage systems since they produce more biomass than they lose, as the anaerobic conditions in their soils allow for low decomposition rates. Although peatlands form only 3% of the Earth’s land surface, their total carbon pool is twice that of the world’s forests; despite this, they are not taken into account in Earth Systems Models that predict future climate change scenarios. However, peatlands are poised to shift from being carbon sinks to becoming carbon sources due to global warming, peat wildfires, and draining of peatlands for peat extraction (peat is used as a fuel and in horticulture) and creating plantations.

How does India plan to use carbon sinks to offset carbon emissions?

Although there are several strategies to either create new carbon sinks (by using buildings, geological formations, or through direct CO 2 capture techniques, etc.) and increase the carbon sequestration of existing sinks (via ocean fertilisation; conservation of forests, peatlands, and grasslands; forest regrowth; and soil carbon sequestration), the efficacies of these techniques are still unclear.

India’s forest carbon stocks, when estimated in 2004 by the Forest Survey of India, stood at 6663 million tonnes (6.6 Petagrams or 29.2 billion tonnes of CO 2 equivalent). Currently, India’s NDC (nationally determined contributions) goal under the Paris Agreement is set at creating an additional 2.5–3 bilion tonnes of CO 2 e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. According to a 2021 report from TERI (The Energy Research Institute), this will be possible only if India doubles its forest cover by 2030. The report highlights the importance of exploring blue carbon initiatives (carbon storage potential in coastal and marine ecosystems), integrated approaches to sustainable forest management, and the agroforestry industry to achieve the NDC goals.

A study in 2021 which explored the potential of India’s agroforestry industry to act as a carbon sink estimates that a 30% expansion in the sector has the potential to offset the country’s carbon emissions by 2050. The research also indicates that agrosilvopastoral systems (which integrate the growth of crops, trees, and livestock) have the highest carbon sink capacities as compared to other systems such as agrisilvicultural (crops + trees) and silvopastoral (trees + livestock).

However, an older study in 2020 showed that species-rich natural forests are much better at carbon capture than the species-poor plantations that are created and managed in agroforestry. “Our study illustrates two ways in which biodiverse forests make better carbon sinks than monoculture plantations – these forests store more carbon in their vegetation and offer more stable rates of carbon capture over years, than plantations,” says Anand Osuri, a DBT Ramalingaswami Fellow with the Nature Conservation Foundation, and the lead author in this study.

“We found that teak and eucalyptus plantations – which were abandoned and not actively managed – not only store 30–50% less carbon than a wet evergreen forest, but the plantations’ ability to capture carbon from the atmosphere is more vulnerable to disturbances such as droughts. While we did not investigate the reasons for these differences in our study, one possible explanation from ecological theory is that high species diversity increases ecosystem productivity and resilience,” he adds.

The Great Carbon Capture Scam,"We know that oil companies hid knowledge of global heating for decades, but the captains of petroleum also schemed to turn the ecological crisis into a profit centre. The industry devised a plan to swindle money from the public purse by pretending to address the climate issue while using subsidies to increase oil production. If one had no moral compass, one might say their scam was a stroke of genius.

Since the oil industry — Shell, Chevron, and others — were not prepared to actually slow oil production to halt global heating, and since they had no intention of aiming for zero carbon emissions, they invented “net zero.” The “net” requires that we subtract some carbon from total emissions to create the illusion of “zero” emissions. Thus, the patriarchs of petroleum profiteering came up with “carbon capture,” a deception that has netted them billions of dollars and euros in public money.

Even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has enabled the scam, since most IPCC climate models require carbon capture and storage (CCS) to balance the carbon books, always of course, at some time in the distant future.

How the scam works

Oil industry geologists knew in the 1950s that all oil fields would deplete over time, as pressure dropped in rock formations and the oil would no longer flow. They developed certain “enhanced oil recovery” technologies to extend the life of depleted oil fields, by fracking and by pumping carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into old wells. However, these technologies were expensive and reduced their gargantuan profit margins. Furthermore, by 1965, even the American Petroleum Institute had anticipated the “catastrophic consequences” of carbon dioxide emissions. Thus the Great Carbon Capture Scam was born.

Industry insiders publicly claimed that they could capture and store the dangerous CO 2 , using public money of course, while secretly planning to use this captured CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery, which would create more carbon emissions. It might take decades for the public to figure out that they had been filched.

In 1948, Chevron discovered a promising field in Scurry County, Texas, which showed signs of depletion by 1951. In 1972, they began the world’s first CCS project, using waste carbon dioxide from a gas field 400 kilometers away, near the Mexican border, shipping it north through a pipeline, and using the gas to extend the life of their Scurry field. After using the CO 2 , they vented the gas, so there was no real climate advantage. However, the technology worked to produce more oil.

Since the companies intended to use captured CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery, the technology was then called “Carbon Capture, Use, and Storage,” (CCUS). In 1992, international oil companies held the first CCUS conference in the Netherlands.

In 1998 Chevron, Exxon-Mobil, Shell, and the Australian government began promoting carbon capture and use for the huge Gorgon gas field in Australia that had two public relations problems: It was in a nature reserve and it produced a relatively dirty, climate-wrecking gas with 14% carbon dioxide waste. Since the carbon had to be captured anyway, to meet export regulations, the oil companies lobbied to have Australian citizens pay for it.

Chevron and their partners received a $60-million grant from the Australian government, and in 2003 Chevron claimed that CCUS was “a vital technology to ensure a safe, reliable supply of energy to meet the world’s needs.” Meanwhile, an API promotional campaign confirmed that CCS was primarily used to “enhance oil production.”

In Australia, the companies promised to capture millions of tonnes of carbon, beginning in 2016, but for the first four years they captured none, and in 2019 the Gorgon CCUS project clogged up with sand and had to shut down for repairs.

To date, Gorgon has captured about 30% of its target for “processing emissions,” but this term hides the fact that the companies have only captured about 2% of the target for total emissions. However, the one thing that Chevron did capture and store was 100% of the $60 million in public hand-outs. “Managing greenhouse gas emissions,” Chevron declared, “is an integral part of how Chevron plans and executes its business.”

The corporate strategy appears to be: Socialize costs and privatize profits. However, carbon capture added an additional strategy: Socialize risk. Since carbon emissions would accelerate global heating, and since the hydrogen produced is highly explosive, the companies faced severe liability risks. No problem: In Australia, Chevron and Shell convinced the government, the taxpayers, to accept liability for the hazardous Gorgon project.

The swindle appears simple: Pretend to help solve a problem, while making the problem worse, socialize the costs and liabilities, and privatize the profits. Clever. However, the unscrupulous scheme began to show signs of unravelling.

Red herrings and red flags

In 2006, the German Federal Ministry of the Environment determined that there was “no direct cost advantage for technologies using fossil fuels [i.e. carbon capture] … compared to advanced renewable energy technologies,” and a year later, the Australian Environmental Protection Agency recommended that the Gorgon project should not proceed due to environmental risks.

EnergyWashington Week revealed, as reported by Oil Change International and the US Environmental Protection Agency, that “A power plant equipped with a CCS system … would need roughly 10 to 40% more energy than a plant of equivalent output without CCS.” More energy consumption yields more CO 2 emissions, not less. These warnings and recommendations were ignored.

The American Petroleum Institute continued to promote carbon capture, although their own consultant report on “Carbon Dioxide Enhanced Oil Recovery” warned that “the amount of infrastructure necessary to perform geologic storage on a meaningful level is equivalent to the existing worldwide infrastructure associated with current oil and gas production.” To reverse global heating, CCUS would require doubling the world’s petroleum infrastructure, built up over the previous century, a near impossibility with costs running into the trillions. Furthermore, that infrastructure would require massive mining, transport of materials, cement, steel, and carbon-intensive fabrication, yielding more emissions.

In 2007, as these nagging problems surfaced, BP scrapped a £500-million carbon capture scheme in Scotland. In the US, a “clean coal” CCS project in Mississippi, behind schedule and billions over budget, closed, and the Petra Nova CCS plant in Texas—promising to capture 1.6 million tonnes of CO2 annually—missed its targets over three years of operation and shut down in 2020. The Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies program at MIT closed due to the technology’s ecological damage and unviable economics in 2016. By the end of 2020, more than 80% of US CCUS projects had failed.

Meanwhile, Western Australia’s Environmental Protection Authority concluded in 2019 that Chevron should be held accountable for venting gas from the Gorgon project and for failing to capture and store the project’s emissions as promised and required.

Quest for dollars

According to a January 2022 study by Global Witness, Shell’s Quest plant in Canada’s tar sands, is emitting more carbon than it is capturing, with the same annual carbon footprint as 1.2 million gas-powered vehicles. Shell’s scheme, one of the biggest boondoggles of carbon capture chicanery, uses the hydrogen produced to refine thick, toxic bitumen into synthetic crude, creating more carbon emissions. The project also emits methane, a much more potent greenhouse gas.

Global Witness found that although Shell’s Quest plant was capturing 4.81-million tonnes of carbon annually (Mt/yr), it was emitting 12.47 Mt/yr in greenhouse gases from on-site and supply chain emissions and from the power required to operate the CCS system. The plant therefore annually is responsible for some 7.66-million tonnes of greenhouse gases, even after the CCUS bookkeeping tricks.

Shell originally promised to capture 90% of emissions, had to admit failure, and changed their target to 65%, but according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, the Quest plant failed to reach its target every year from 2015 to 2020.

Upon awarding the Quest project a Canadian-dollar $834-million subsidy (US$654-million, €571-million) Canada’s Ministry of Natural Resources Joanna Sivasankaran claimed that CCS was “an important tool on the pathway to reaching Canada’s ambitious climate goals,” to reach “net-zero by 2050.” However, since the Quest project emits more than it captures and increases tar sands production, the dirtiest, most carbon-intensive petroleum product on Earth, these “ambitious climate goals,” remain unattainable and appear preposterous.

Four hundred international scientists, academics, and energy analysts signed a letter to the Canadian government asking that they halt the subsidy scam. “Deploying CCUS at any climate-relevant scale,” they wrote, “carried out within the short timeframe we have to avert climate catastrophe without posing substantial risks to communities on the front lines of the buildout, is a pipe dream.”

The letter warned that CCUS is “not a negative emissions technology,” with billions of taxpayer dollars used to boost oil production. The scientists and scholars warned of the health impacts to local communities, that the tax subsidies would tie Canada to “dependence on dirty tar sands,” and that the project would add some 50 million metric tons CO 2 emissions annually by 2035.

According to Lubicon Cree citizen Melina Laboucan-Massimo, the tar sands project yields “elevated rates of cancers, as well as elevated rates of respiratory illnesses … contamination to the water, destruction and complete fragmentation of the Boreal forest.”

According to Reuters, 26 commercial CCS facilities around the world capture about 40 million tonnes of CO 2 each year. To put that in perspective, the world emits about 36.4-billion tonnes of CO2 each year.

That means that after 50 years of CCS development; after billions of dollars in subsidies; after all the hype, deceits, tax breaks, and guarantees; the oil industry captures about 0.1% of annual CO 2 emissions. The other 99.9 % pollutes the atmosphere and heats Earth. Meanwhile, most of this captured CO 2 is used to produce more oil. Since that first CCS project began in 1972, world CO 2 emissions have almost tripled from 14.68 to 36.4 billion tonnes per year, not exactly the “net zero” we were promised.

Carbon capture was a scam from the beginning, and remains so today.

"City-wide greenhouse gas emissions of communities nearby the world heritage site of Ayutthaya, Thailand","Total city-wide emissions

In 2018, the total city-wide GHG emissions of Ayutthaya Municipality were approximately 99,137.04 tCO 2 eq. Energy sector was by far the biggest contributor to the total emissions (49%; 48,216.54 tCO 2 eq), followed by the waste sector (36%; 35,659 tCO 2 eq), transportation (11%; 11,191.75 tCO 2 eq), and AFOLU (4%, 4,069.75 tCO 2 eq) (Fig. 2a). Overall, estimated GHG intensity was 1.93 tCO 2 eq per capita. Similarly, a study conducted by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization16 reported that the annual per capita GHG emissions of some cities (i.e., at the municipal level) in Thailand ranged from 1.28 to 3.74. It should be noted that municipal-level GHG emissions were slightly lower than in denser cities and metro areas. Under such situations, per capita emissions seemed to decline with decline in urban density. For instance, residents in the capital city of Thailand, Bangkok, were responsible for emitting 7.01 tCO 2 eq per capita in 201616. In developed cities like London and New York, per capita emissions were 6.18 (in 2006) and 5.8 (in 2014) tCO 2 eq, respectively17. Shan et al.18 conducted an inventory of CO 2 emissions of Chinese cities in 2010 and revealed that Hohhot and Nanping generated the highest (29.67 tCO 2 eq per capita) and lowest CO 2 emissions per capita (2.38 tCO 2 eq per capita), respectively. On the basis of scope, in this study, indirection emissions from consumption of purchased electricity (Scope 2) in the Ayutthaya Municipality represented the largest source of emissions (38%), followed by Scope 3 and Scope 1 (Fig. 2b).

Energy

Energy sector was by far the greatest contributor to the total GHG emissions (49%) in Ayutthaya Municipality. Within this, the residential sector was the primary contributor to GHG emissions (37,672.89 tCO 2 eq; 78%), followed by commercial and governmental organizations (18.49%), and public lighting (i.e., highway street lighting, 3.38%) (Table 2). Among commercial and governmental organizations, hospitals, schools, and hotels located in the municipality released large amounts of GHGs (812.60–4218.84 tCO 2 eq). Compared to other sub-districts, Pratuchai, which is the most populated subdistrict and where the WHS is located, was the largest source of GHG emissions (7797.10 tCO 2 eq). Interestingly, however, the WHS emitted only 206.38 tCO 2 eq (while temples and cultural heritage site emitted 151.63 and 54.74 tCO 2 eq, respectively), accounting for approximately 0.2% of the total city-wide emissions. The results of energy-related GHG emissions obtained using the GPC were similar to those obtained via the LCA approach. Emission results generated using the IPCC2013 GWP 100a method also revealed that the residential sector accounted for a significant share of the total energy-related CO 2 emissions (74%; 31,866.18 tCO 2 eq). Commercial and governmental organizations emitted almost a quarter (22%; 10,695.76 tCO 2 eq) of this total. Meanwhile, public lighting and the WHS were attributable for only 4% and < 1% of total emissions from energy consumption.

Table 2 GHG emissions from the energy sector, by scope and source of emissions. Full size table

Relatedly, the WHS was found to account for the lowest GHG emissions using both the GPC and LCA methods. It is possible that most of the ancient buildings at the WHS of Ayutthaya municipality are located outdoors. Many of these historic heritage sites rely mainly on natural light and ventilation for thermal and lighting comfort during the day. In terms of electricity consumption, only lamps are commonly used for lighting, especially at night. However, improving sustainability and energy efficiency in built historic heritage have become high-interest topics among scholars. For instance, European countries with colder climates are most interested in reducing energy consumption in historic buildings19. The European Directives showed the potential of the building sector in achieving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Specifically, study conducted by Serraino and Lucchi20 investigated energy retrofit intervention in a castle in Italy and reported that the following criteria must be considered in the implementation of a highly-energy efficient system in historic buildings: achieving building thermal comfort and minimizing CO 2 emissions and running costs. Some studies have focused on natural lighting design and solar radiation control in heritage buildings21,22. A study of Martínez-Molina et al.19 also observed that improving indoor climate, energy efficiency, and thermal comfort in historic buildings have become a major issue. Further, Marchi et al.11 assessed environmental policies for GHG emission reduction at UNESCO heritage sites of Italy using integrated energy-saving measures and revealed that installation of solar panels on roofs of existing buildings was the most effective environmental policy for decarbonization. GHG emissions equivalent to 17,000 tCO 2 eq per year could be avoided using this measure (57% reduction in GHG emissions in the short term; 10 years).

Transportation

In 2018, the volume of GHGs emitted by on-road transport sector of the Ayutthaya Municipality amounted to 11,191.75 tCO 2 eq (11%). The combustion of diesel fuel generated the largest share of emissions (39%) compared to gasohol 91 (37%) and gasohol 95 (24%) for road transport, respectively. It has been suggested that the main factors affecting commuting-related CO 2 emissions of individuals their and households in local context of Thailand should be more investigated. This finding is in line with Marchi et al.11 who reported that diesel is most widely used in the transport sector. By reducing transportation emissions, a study of Li et al.23 suggested that many behavioral targeting policies should be implemented in mobility management in cities to reduce private motorized transport that could contribute to a reduction in CO 2 emissions.

AFOLU

Methane emissions from AFOLU within the city boundary were estimated by employing Eqs. 3 and 6. In this research, methane emissions from rice fields were estimated based on emission factor for a particular harvested area of rice, cultivation period of rice (day), and also annual harvested area of rice. In terms of land use, only 2% of the total area of Ayutthaya Municipality (i.e., Khao Rain, Klong Suan Phlu, and Huntra sub-districts) served as agricultural area. All the rice growing areas in the municipality is under rain-fed cultivation. The period of rice cultivation in this study area was about 180 days. The results found that the AFOLU sector of Ayutthaya Municipality emitted approximately 4069.75 tCO 2 eq (accounting for 4% of city-wide emissions). This is within the range of estimated GHG emissions from rice cultivation in other municipalities of Thailand (1.13–6106.75 tCO 2 eq)16. In terms of alternatives for mitigating emissions related to rice cultivation water management, Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) is a possible option to mitigate methane emission from irrigated rice paddies. A research conducted by Oo et al.24 confirmed that yield-scaled GHG emissions from AWD cultivation were significantly lower than from continuous flooding cultivation.

Waste

The GPC report10 highlighted that city should report GHG emissions from disposal of waste generated within the city boundary, whether treated inside or outside the boundary of city. In this study, the total solid waste sent to landfill in 2018 was 18,130 tonnes, comprising 95.4% of non-food organic waste, 3.3.4% of food waste, and 1.43% of solid waste that is paper and textiles, respectively. The default values of methane correction factor (MCF) of 1 and oxidation factor (OX) of 0.1 for managed landfill were used in estimation of methane emission. In 2018, Ayutthaya Municipality generated 18,130.19 tons of municipal solid waste, all of which was sent to a landfill located outside the city boundary. Within Scope 3 of the GPC, waste sector was the second largest source of GHG emissions, accounting for 35,658.61 tCO 2 eq (36% of the total emission). This result is consistent with other reports in literature; for example, Hoklis and Sharp25 reported that in 2009, 338.51 GgCO 2 eq of methane was emitted from municipal solid waste in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It was clearly observed in this study that waste disposal activities in tourism cities may result in direct and indirect GHG emissions. Further, previous studies reported that in 2018, tourist areas of Thailand generated approximately 1–2.5 kg of waste per person per day26,27. Therefore, behavior of both resident and tourist plays an important role in mitigating climate change, as it determines the solid waste generation rate of the community.

GHG mitigation scenarios and AHP assessment of climate change mitigation policy

Under the BAU scenario, total GHG emissions of Ayutthaya Municipality would increase from 99,137.04 tCO 2 eq in 2018 to 161,123.67 tCO 2 eq and 113,316.63 tCO 2 eq in 2030 in case of forecasted annual economic growth rates of 4.13% and 1.12%, respectively. The residential sector was attributable for the largest proportion of GHG emissions (78%). Under BAU condition, estimated GHG emissions from the residential sector were about 37,672.89 tCO 2 eq. This is projected to increase to 43,056.66 tCO 2 eq and 61,221.79 tCO 2 eq in 2030 at annual economic growth rates of 4.13% and 1.12%, respectively. Potential GHG mitigation options were proposed based primarily on Thailand’s NDC. If all policy interventions as indicated in Thailand’s NDC Roadmap on Climate Change Mitigation (2021–2030) are “fully” implemented in the residential sector, total GHG emissions would be reduced by 9735.47% tCO 2 eq and 6846.86 tCO 2 eq in 2030 assuming 4.13% and 1.12% annual economic growth rates, respectively. These policy interventions include (i) energy-saving measures and strategies and (ii) applying renewable energy in residential buildings. As shown in Fig. 3a,b, the forecast results revealed that applying all energy-saving strategies could provide greater GHG reduction than the implementation of renewable energy policy in the local case study.

According to the judgment on pairwise comparisons of AHP, Tables 3 and 4 revealed that high-efficiency cooling systems should be excluded in the AHP. Installation of LED lighting showed the highest score, followed by improving energy efficiency of air conditioners, and energy efficient appliances and cooking stoves. Establishing renewable energy technologies presented the lowest score in the AHP comparison. In the case of factors that affect climate mitigation policy decisions and implementation, feasibility of implementing mitigation measures (i.e., technical possibilities) presented the highest score (0.45), followed by policy feasibility (0.39) (i.e., policy possibility and cost effectiveness of implementing climate strategies). Surprisingly, environmental performance (i.e., benefits of policy on environment and climate change) showed the lowest score (0.16) in terms of stakeholder’s preference for tackling climate change in the case study. These results are consistent with Heinrich et al.14 who revealed that feasibility of implementation was the most important criteria for developing climate change mitigation measures in the power sector. Direct contribution to GHG mitigation as climate benefit was one of the highest AHP criteria, which is inconsistent with this research.

Overall, as clearly pointed out above, energy consumption in the residential sector was attributable for the largest share of GHG emissions in this research case study. The following recommendations were proposed:

Aligning city policies for a low-carbon society: It is strongly suggested that each city in Thailand quantify city-wide CO 2 emission inventory and their reduction targets. The country’s NDC targets must be linked to city-level policy. Moreover, policy decision makers, local authorities, and all stakeholders should urgently prioritize climate change action policy and mitigation strategies, which had the lowest AHP score, in their local area. Specific detailed information on city-level CO 2 emissions would be much more meaningful to the decision-making process of local authorities than aggregated information at the national level28. However, interestingly, a study conducted by Gouldson et al.29 revealed that the absence of multi-level governance arrangements that potentially enable the implementation of low carbon development strategies at the urban level in Asian cities will have global implications for climate change. Moreover, there are still some challenges associated with creating city-level GHG emission inventories such as the use of different methods and approaches and the difficulty of defining city boundary and cross-boundary activities. Further, activities data at the city level are limited and incomparable. It is therefore necessary that data collection for GHG inventory at the city level be as accurate as possible and all uncertainty associated with inventories be avoided.

Creating green tourism culture in the WHS

Ayutthaya, a UNESCO WHS, is one of the most famous landmarks and a major tourist attraction of Thailand. The importance of tourism development and GHG emission is now being emphasized by academic scholars. A report by the UNWTO-UNEP-WMP1 (2008) revealed that CO 2 emissions generated by tourism was attributable for approximately 3.9 to 6% of the total global emissions in 2015. Similarly, a report by Katircioglu et al.30 found that tourism directly affected both energy consumption and carbon emissions in the long-term economy of Cyprus. In China, research conducted by Meng et al.31 assessed carbon emissions of the tourism industry using the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) and the input–output model and found that the Chinese tourism industry accounted for 2.425–2.489% of the total CO 2 emissions of all industries in China from 2002 to 2010. Overall, transportation activities accounted for about two-thirds of the total direct emissions, followed by accommodation and food services, and shopping. It should be highlighted that specific information on carbon emissions induced by tourism, especially at the city level in Thailand, are missing. This study strongly suggests that further assessments of carbon emissions from tourism be performed in future research. Further, the impacts of tourism activities and GHG emissions associated with solid waste generation should be urgently explored. Moreover, human and social sustainability of all related environmental and climate change mitigation project should be systematically investigated32.",,[],"['Yensukho', 'Inter-Department In Environmental Science Graduate School', 'Chulalongkorn University', 'Bangkok', 'Sugsaisakon', 'Environment Development', 'Sustainability', 'Eds', 'Graduate School', 'Kittipongvises']"
How sugar can help reduce CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants,"In the document, the experts also explain that they decided to look into a family of materials different from the commonly used amines to overcome some of their limitations.

As organic, ammonia-derived compounds that contain nitrogen, amines are able to selectively remove carbon dioxide from gas mixtures in aqueous solutions. However, oxygen degrades them every time they’re cycled, which means that more and more of the material would need to be produced, thus driving up the cost.

The new materials, on the other hand, contain hydroxide salts in their pores. Typically, solutions of hydroxide salts reversibly react with carbon dioxide and form bicarbonate salts, such as baking soda, trapping the carbon dioxide. But in order to regenerate the hydroxide salt, the material needs to be heated up to 500 to 800 degrees Celsius—no easy feat, and not a cheap one, either.

However, the lead author of the study, Mary Zick, found that by incorporating bundles of sugar molecules called cyclodextrins as a starter and boiling them with alkali metal salts in water, she could create a sponge-like material that is riddled with cavities in which carbon dioxide binds strongly, but in which other gases such as nitrogen pass easily through.

“What’s nice about this work is that Mary not only found a material that’s useful for carbon-dioxide capture from coal flue gas, but she outlined the structure-property relationships that will allow us to design materials for other applications, like capturing CO2 from natural gas-fired power plants, as well as maybe even from air, which is one of the really big challenges of our time,” study co-author Phillip Milner said in a media statement.

In Milner’s view, the findings in this study are relevant because coal emissions are still the No. 1 anthropogenic contributor to carbon-dioxide emissions in the world.",,[],[]
Vehicle integrated solar to power refrigerated trailers,"Sono Motors will apply its vehicle-integrated PV solutions to the commercial transport sector, as part of a new partnership with Chereau, a France-based producer of refrigerated vehicles for transport of food, medicines and other deep frozen products.

The partnership will see the two companies collaborate to produce a prototype refrigerated truck integrated with 58.9m² of solar modules, amounting to 9.8 kW of generation capacity. The trailer is expected to be on the show at a transport trade show later this year, and will then undergo further testing to evaluate its suitability for a high-volume production vehicle.

“With this partnership, we are entering a new market for our solar technology,” Lars Löhle, product group lead at Sono Motors told pv magazine. “Our goal is to bring solar on every vehicle and we therefore offer a technology solution that is suitable for high volume series production. According to the innovative technology, energy savings of up to 80% compared to diesel can be achieved.”

In conventional refrigerated vehicles, cooling is powered either by a diesel generator separate from the truck engine, or an additional battery. By instead powering this through an integrated PV array, Sono Motors estimates that it can save 3,400 liters of fuel and avoid 9 tonnes of CO 2 emissions per vehicle, per year. Sono has further calculated that production emissions for the solar integrated trailer amount to approximately 6.5 tons, which could be offset after less than one year.

After its unveiling in September, the truck will undergo a trial for several months in use by a Chereau customer in France. One of the goals of this trial is to verify Sono’s calculations regarding the energy yield and emissions reduction potential.

Charge control

The system will be fitted with Sono Motors’ solar charge controller, which optimizes individual module energy yields to help the installation deal with shading. And the company has developed a manufacturing process specifically tailored to integration into the surface of the trailer, differing from the processes used in its Sion passenger vehicle, where more focus is required on integrating solar into the vehicle's curved surfaces.

“The solar integration solutions provided by Sono Motors are the perfect fit for our trailers. We are pleased to be able to work with Sono Motors to create the future prototype that will be part of our demo fleet of sustainable reefer trailers,” said Damien Destremau, CEO at The Reefer Group and Chereau. “This is a big step towards making commercial mobility more sustainable and reducing emissions.”

Finally, Sono Motors notes that it expects strongly growing demand for refrigerated transport in the coming years, with increasing demand for deep frozen good, fast food and medicines. Increasing fuel costs and growing restrictions/penalties being applied to CO 2 emissions make the case for vehicles like this even more compelling.",,[],"['Mark Hutchins', 'Mark Hutchins Joined Pv Magazine In September As Production Editor Of The Monthly Global Title.', 'Mark Also Works Online Reporting On Upstream Technology', 'Markets', 'As Well As Newly Emerging Solar Regions.']"
MN auto dealers sue MPCA over clean-car rule aimed at curbing CO2,"The Minnesota Auto Dealers Association on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in an attempt to block a “clean car” rule set to take effect in 2024.

The organization in a petition filed with the Minnesota Court of Appeals argued that the agency overstepped its statutory authority in implementing the rule that would require auto manufacturers to make more electric and hybrid vehicles available in Minnesota.

State law prohibits agencies from delegating authority to other entities, the group argued, and in this case, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency turned over its authority to the California Air Resources Board when it adopted that state’s standard. Minnesota is also barred from adopting the rule under federal clean air standards, the association said.

Since the introduction of the clean car standards in 2019, pollution control officials said the plan would help Minnesota reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the state’s top source: transportation. Roughly 25% of the heat-trapping gasses that spur warming temperatures and more extreme weather events in the U.S. stem from cars and low-duty trucks. And they argued it could help put the state back in line with 2007 goals set in statute.

From the start, the Minnesota Auto Dealers Association has vocally opposed the standard and it has tried to quash it during the rule-making process, in the Legislature and in the courts. A federal judge last year dismissed a similar lawsuit that the association brought forward.

Auto dealers and Republican lawmakers have argued that consumer demand should drive the market and that dealers shouldn’t have to carry vehicles that might not be in high demand in their area.

“Dealers are all in for the adoption of EVs and are making sizable investments in their businesses to get ready for an expected increase in demand, but they’re making plans based on consumer appetite, not what California dictates,” association president Scott Lambert said.

The MPCA held hearings around the state on the proposal and an administrative law judge last year approved it. But the change has spurred years of tense debates at the Capitol about the state’s role in moving the industry toward more fuel-efficient options.

Agency spokesman Darin Broton on Thursday said the MPCA stood by the rule and believed the court would allow it to remain in place.

“While the agency reviews this new legal action, it is important to recognize that gas is $4.64 per gallon and Minnesotans want more choices that are better for their pocketbooks and the environment,” Broton said. “The auto dealers last year filed a similar lawsuit and it was dismissed. We are confident that the clean car standards, developed through authority granted by the legislature and approved by a judge, will stand.”

Earlier this year, the Minnesota Senate brought forth a bill that would strike the clean car standard and prevent the MPCA from putting forward similar requirements moving forward. The proposal didn’t pick up support in the DFL-led House of Representatives.

After the proposal languished in the Legislature, the auto dealers said they had to take on the matter on their own and bring the issue before the court.",,[],"['Dana Ferguson', 'Follow Dana Ferguson On Twitter', 'Bydanaferguson', 'Call Or Email Dferguson Forumcomm.Com']"
"Slashing carbon dioxide emissions isn't enough to avert catastrophic climate change, study warns","In the fight against global warming, the importance of slashing our carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is regularly hammered home.

But a new study has warned that cutting CO2 isn't enough on its own.

Instead, researchers from Georgetown University say that strategies to avert catastrophic climate change should also focus on reducing other 'largely neglected' pollutants including methane, ground-level ozone smog, and nitrous oxide.

'Tackling both carbon dioxide and the short-lived pollutants at the same time offers the best and the only hope of humanity making it to 2050 without triggering irreversible and potentially catastrophic climate change,' the team explained.

Researchers from Georgetown University say that strategies to avert catastrophic climate change should also focus on reducing other 'largely neglected' pollutants including methane, ground-level ozone smog, and nitrous oxide

A: If CO2 emissions are cut alone (orange line), temperatures could exceed the 2.7°F (1.5°C) level by 2035, but if other pollutants are also targeted (green line), warming will be significantly reduced. B: the rate of warming with CO2 emissions cut (orange) versus CO2 plus other pollutants cut (green)

What other pollutants should we focus on? The researchers say we must adopt a 'dual strategy' that also reduces non-CO2 pollutants, including: Methane

Hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants

Black carbon soot

Ground-level ozone smog

Nitrous oxide They calculate that together, these five pollutants currently contribute almost as much to global warming as CO2. Advertisement

In the study, the researchers analysed the impact of cutting CO2 alone, versus cutting the pollutant alongside other non-CO2 climate pollutants, in both the near-term and mid-term to 2050.

Their findings suggest that cutting CO2 alone can't prevent global temperatures from exceeding 2.7°F (1.5°C) above pre-industrial levels – the limit set in the 2015 Paris Agreement.

In fact, the researchers say that focusing on CO2 alone won't even stop temperatures from exceeding 3.6°F (2°C).

Instead, the researchers say we must adopt a 'dual strategy' that also reduces non-CO2 pollutants, including methane, hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, black carbon soot, ground-level ozone smog, and nitrous oxide.

They calculate that together, these five pollutants currently contribute almost as much to global warming as CO2.

However, while CO2 lasts for a long time in the atmosphere, most of these pollutants only last a short time, according to the team.

This suggests cutting them could slow warming even faster than any other mitigation strategy.

Several other pollutants are released into the air from a range of industries, including road transport, energy industries and agriculture

WHAT IS NET ZERO? Net zero refers to achieving an overall balance between emissions produced and emissions taken out of the atmosphere. Net-zero organisations should be actively reducing their emissions aligned to a 1.5ᵒC science-based target in line with the Paris Agreement. There will be some carbon emissions that cannot be eliminated with current technology, so to achieve net zero, it is essential that certified greenhouse gas removals are also in place. The UK government says it is committed to ensuring emissions generated by the UK re offset by removing the same amount of carbon from the atmosphere. There are two main ways this can be achieved – by planting more trees and by installing 'carbon capture' technology at the source of the pollution. Source: Carbon Trust Advertisement

A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that cutting fossil fuel emissions and shifting to clean energy will actually make global warming worse in the short-term.

Burning fossil fuels also emits sulphate aerosols, which cool the climate – and these are reduced along with CO2 when switching to clean energy.

However, while much of the CO2 released from the burning of fossil fuels lasts hundreds of years in the atmosphere, sulphate aerosols only linger for a few weeks.

This leads to overall warming for the first decade or two.

The new study accounts for this effect, and concludes that only focusing on reducing fossil fuel emissions could result in 'weak, near term warming'.

Worryingly, this could potentially cause temperatures to exceed the 2.7°F (1.5°C) level by 2035 and the 3.6°F (2°C) level by 2050.

However, if non-carbon dioxide pollutants are also reduced, it will 'significantly improve the chance of remaining below the [2.7°F] 1.5°C guardrail,' according to the team.

'Continuing to slash fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions remains vital, the study emphasises, since that will determine the fate of the climate in the longer term beyond 2050,' the researchers explained in a press release.

'Phasing out fossil fuels also is essential because they produce air pollution that kills over eight million people every year and causes billions of dollars of damage to crops.'

The study come shortly after researchers warned that there is at most a 10 per cent chance of limiting global warming to 2.7°F (1.5°C) unless 'substantially' more is done to hit net-zero pledges this decade.

Researchers analysed climate targets of 196 countries from the time of the Paris Agreement until the end of the COP26 meeting in Glasgow last November.

Adopted in 2016, the Paris Agreement aims to hold an increase in global average temperature to below 3.6°F (2°C) and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 2.7°F (1.5°C).

Climate pledges made at COP26 could keep warming to just below 3.6ºF, but only if all commitments are implemented as proposed, the scientists say.

However, the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement – to keep warming to 2.7°F (1.5°C) or below – has only a 6-10 per cent chance of being achieved, they say.",,[],"['Shivali Best', 'Shivali Best For Mailonline']"

How the US can cut its emissions in half by 2030,"In 2021, the US committed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Researchers used six leading energy-economic models to identify pathways for the US to achieve this goal.

Energy efficiency, cleaner electricity and rapid electrification are central strategies for emissions reductions, the study finds.

Actions taken to reach the 2030 target will also help create jobs and increase international competitiveness.

In 2021, the US raised its Paris climate pledge, committing to cut its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Yet questions remain about the actions needed to meet this target.

In an article published in Science, my co-authors and I apply six leading energy-economic models of US energy supply and demand, to identify pathways to reach this 2030 goal. Model intercomparison studies of this sort are used in fields such as climate science and energy modelling, to identify which findings are robust across models and input assumptions – and which differ.

Overall, we find robust agreement that there will be keys roles in meeting the 2030 target for low-carbon electricity and electrification⁠ – substituting electricity for fossil fuels in transport, buildings and industry. The models also align on the need for large-scale deployment of renewables, electric vehicles and other technologies, relative to historical levels and to scenarios where current policies continue.

Pathways for limiting warming to 1.5C generally involve roughly halving global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2030 and reaching net-zero CO2 emissions around 2050. This means that our study can be useful for other countries as they consider immediate action to mitigate emissions.

Emissions pathways by sector

Meeting the increased US ambition for 2030 would mean tripling the pace of historical GHG reductions in the country. With less than eight years left, what steps would need to be taken to meet this target?

We find that roughly 70-90% of emissions reductions by 2030 come from the power and transport sectors, shown by the purple and light green chunks in the figure below, respectively. These sectors are currently the largest emitters and have lower-cost mitigation options available.

Roughly 70-90% of emissions reductions by 2030 come from the power and transport sectors. Image: Bistline, et al. (2022)

Despite this, all sectors still contribute to the 2030 target. Cutting emissions in half by 2030 requires all technology and policy arrows in the quiver. Energy efficiency, cleaner electricity and rapid electrification are central strategies for near- and long-term emissions reductions, our study found.

Immediate and sustained efforts are needed in several areas, which exceed recent trends:

New wind and solar capacity increase two to seven times faster than the past 10 years. The largest annual deployment of wind and solar capacity to date was 2021 with 27 gigawatts (GW), but pathways to reach the 2030 target generally involve doubling or tripling the amount of renewable capacity built each year.

Coal capacity retirements increase through 2030 and coal generation drops by 90-100% from current levels.

Transport electrification adoption accelerates. Electric vehicles (EVs) increase from about 4% of new light-duty sales today to 34-100% by 2030, with an average across models of 67%. This exceeds the pace projected to occur with current policies (16-77% with a 38% average).

Power sector changes that have taken place over the past 10 years are shown in the leftmost column in the figure below, with annual average growth this decade in pathways meeting the 2030 target shown for each of the six models in the other columns. Notably, the rate of coal power capacity closures is consistent across all models, exceeding 20GW per year to 2030.

The rate of coal power capacity closures is consistent across all models, exceeding 20GW per year to 2030. Image: Adapted from Bistline, et al. (2022)

In the transport sector, the Biden administration set a 50% EV sales target by 2030, but our model results suggest that EV deployment may have to exceed that level to reach the economy-wide emissions target.

This is illustrated in the figure below, which compares historical EV adoption rates (yellow line) and in our six target-compliant pathways (brown lines), with the administration’s current 50% by 2030 target. On average, our models suggest current policies would lead to EV adoption reaching around 35% by 2030, whereas pathways meeting the overall 2030 climate goal entail an average adoption rate of 65%.

Current policies would lead to EV adoption reaching around 35% by 2030 - 30% short of the average adoption rate needed to reach the 2030 climate goal. Image: Adapted from Bistline, et al. (2022)

In addition to these broad similarities, there are several key differences across models. These include levels of electrification (and electricity demand growth), shares of wind and solar capacity, extent of new gas-fired power capacity and level of infrastructure deployment (such as electricity transmission networks).

The models also disagree about the role of carbon capture and storage (CCS), where three of six participating models deploy gas with CCS up to 70GW capacity by 2030. The models without CCS generally deploy more gas-fired capacity without CCS and energy storage.

Policy implications

Models agree that additional enabling policies are needed to facilitate the transition to meet the 2030 target. Comparing these scenarios against ones with current policies and technological trends reveals implementation gaps, which additional policies and incentives would need to close.

Existing climate policies are expected to lower energy-related CO2 by only 6-28% from 2005 levels by 2030, shown by the various columns in the figure below. This means those current policies would fall well short of reaching the 50-52% target for 2030 (horizontal line).

Existing climate policies are expected to lower energy-related CO2 by only 6-28% from 2005 levels by 2030. Image: Adapted from Bistline, et al. (2022)

Models include different policies to close this gap. Some use bottom-up, sector-specific measures to mirror policy proposals, while others use top-down approaches to identify “least-cost” mitigation pathways using primarily an economy-wide GHG cap. Policies include clean energy tax credits, power sector standards, end-use equipment rebates, carbon pricing and combinations of these options.

Marginal costs of CO2 abatement, which equal the costs associated with the last tonne of CO2 reduced, range from $36-155 per tonne in 2030 across participating models. This broad range is due to differences in model assumptions about policies and technological costs.

Although questions remain about which policies and incentives are politically attractive and durable, these scenarios illustrate that many different combinations of policies could be used by policymakers to halve emissions by 2030.

The US Senate is currently debating over $500bn in tax credits for renewables, EVs and low-emissions technologies, but the fate of these incentives – and how close they come to narrowing the 2030 emissions gap – remain uncertain.

Environment How is the World Economic Forum fighting the climate crisis? Our planet is straining under the burden of a global population of nearly 8 billion people.



The World Economic Forum’s Centre for Nature and Climate accelerates actions on climate change and environmental sustainability, food systems, the circular economy and value chains, and the future of international development. Through the Global Plastic Action Partnership, we are bringing together government, business and civil society to shape a more sustainable world through the eradication of plastic pollution.

The centre is championing Nature-Based Solutions. Global companies are working together through the 1t.org initiative to support 1 trillion trees by 2030. Since September 2021, over 30 companies have committed to conserve, restore and grow more than 3.6 billion trees in over 60 countries.

Through a partnership with the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and over 30 global businesses, the Forum is encouraging companies to join the First Movers Coalition and invest in innovative green technologies so they are available for massive scale-up by 2030 to enable net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.

The centre is also bringing leaders together to make commitments to a circular economy approach. Globally, the Scale360° initiative will reduce the environmental impact of value chains within the fashion, food, plastics and electronics industries – a significant step in making the $4.5 trillion circular economy opportunity a reality. The African Circular Economy Alliance is funding circular economy entrepreneurs and circular economy activities in countries including Rwanda, Nigeria and South Africa. In China, the Forum's Circular Electronics in China project is helping companies reduce and recycle 50% of e-waste by 2025.

The Forum is also crowdsourcing solutions to the climate crisis through its open innovation platform, UpLink. Since 2020 this digital space has welcomed over 40,000 users who are working on over 30 challenges including reducing plastic ocean pollution, scaling efforts to conserve, restore and grow 1 trillion trees and innovating the production and processing of aquatic foods. Contact us for more information on how to get involved.



Benefits and costs

Actions to meet the 2030 goal generate a range of benefits. Avoided global climate damages from these policies are estimated by one participating model at roughly $140bn per year. There are also co-benefits of localised reductions in air pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can have significant and immediate benefits for human health.

Other benefits could include creating jobs, boosting innovation, increasing international competitiveness and improving equity outcomes for low-income households – all factors that depend on policy implementation details.

In terms of policy costs, models can calculate increases in energy system expenditures to reach the 2030 target (including spending on fuels, maintenance and capital costs of supply- and demand-side technologies) relative to reference levels without these policies.

These incremental costs are $90bn-280bn per year by 2030, though technological progress in renewables and EVs have substantially reduced these decarbonisation costs, even compared with a few years ago.

Next steps

Our article shows that the next steps in reaching the 2030 US climate target are clearer and increasingly affordable, but require new supporting policies to get there. Actions to reach this goal likely involve widespread deployment of existing technologies, which take advantage of technological change and associated policies from earlier periods.

The large and rapid buildouts of resources, exceeding levels in the recent past, suggest that institutional innovation could be required to increase adoption at a faster pace, including accelerated siting and permitting of low-emitting projects.

Our study provides more detailed projections, actionable insights and greater confidence about the policies and technology deployment needed to achieve near-term climate goals. These actions can lay the groundwork for an affordable, reliable and equitable clean energy transition.",,[],"['John Bistline', 'Written By', 'Paige Bennett', 'Helen Nugent', 'Terry', 'F.

""Our inaugural report is focused on the ‘E' in ESG, naturally, because our company was created to address the climate crisis,"" says Andrew Benedek, chairman and CEO at Anaergia. ""This report quantifies the effects of Anaergia's technologies and projects, which address a leading cause of climate change – the problem of methane emissions from waste. We are turning this methane emissions problem on its head. Instead of allowing waste to cause climate change, we are using it to create a much-needed carbon-negative renewable fuel. Doing so can address about two-thirds of all point-source methane emissions.""

Air France cuts CO2 emissions by 45 percent on demo flights,"Air France has conducted two eco demonstration flights with a cut of 45 per cent in CO 2 emissions. The flights were detailed in ICAO’s Uniting Aviation which we reprint in full below.

In April Air France launched “Air France ACT“, a programme that aims to reduce CO 2 emissions by 30 per cent per passenger-km by 2030 compared to 2019 (i.e. 12 per cent less total emissions). To demonstrate how this objective can be achieved, the airline simultaneously implemented a series of actions on two of its flights leaving from Paris-Charles de Gaulle.

This project is part of the “Skyteam Sustainable Flight Challenge”, an initiative aimed at stimulating and encouraging innovation by inviting the alliance’s member airlines to operate the most eco-responsible flights possible from May 1 to 14 2022.

Through this initiative Air France intends to:

measure and illustrate the effectiveness of methods already implemented and proven, such as new-generation aircraft, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), eco-piloting, and the use of electric ramp and cargo transport equipment

explore new avenues that could be exploited in the future, such as the extensive use of artificial intelligence to optimise flight paths or the use of autonomous tractors for baggage transport,

offering customers more sustainable, local and seasonal catering, limiting food waste by allowing them to choose the in-flight menu before they fly, and limiting single-use plastic,

The Air France demonstration operation took place on two commercial flights, one to Montreal operated by an Airbus A350 on May 3, 2022, and the other to Lisbon on May 4, 2022, operated by an Airbus A220. These latest-generation aircraft, which are at the heart of Air France’s fleet renewal strategy, consume 20 to 25 per cent less fuel than previous generation aircraft. Their noise footprint is reduced by a third. By 2030, these aircraft will account for 70 per cent of the Air France fleet, compared with 7 per cent today, thanks to an investment of one billion euros per year between now and 2025.

The Air France flight to Montreal was fuelled with 16 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and the flight to Lisbon with 30 per cent SAF, compared with 1% currently used on flights leaving from France under the current regulations. These non-fossil fuels are produced from biomass such as used cooking oil. They do not compete with the food chain and allow an average reduction of 80 per cent in CO 2 emissions compared to conventional fuel over their entire life cycle. To take the example of used vegetable oils, this means taking into account the capture of CO 2 during the growth of the plant, its first life as cooking oil, its recycling and its use as aviation fuel.

On the ground and onboard, the pilots implemented eco-piloting techniques, such as taxiing on a single-engine on the ground and optimising trajectories in real-time, in coordination with air traffic control.

The use of these methods enabled a reduction of close to 45 per cent in CO 2 emissions on each of the two flights. This operation and its significant result were made possible thanks to the commitment of staff from all Air France sectors, pilots, flight crews, ground staff, cargo and maintenance personnel, commercial services and operational support. Several other companies and partners have also contributed to this achievement, such as Airbus, TotalEnergies, Groupe ADP, Servair, Charlatte, Navya, and Montreal and Lisbon airports. This joint action is in line with Air France’s conviction that the decarbonization of the aviation sector will be the result of a joint collaboration with manufacturers, airlines, airport authorities, public authorities and national and international bodies.

According to Vincent Etchebehere, VP of Sustainability and new mobilities at Air France, “After the announcement of our new science-based CO 2 emission reduction targets, it was important for us to illustrate in concrete terms how our sector must transform itself to respond to the climate emergency. On two flights, to Montreal and Lisbon, we have involved our partners and customers in a process aimed at proving the performance of the exisiting procedures, and at coming up with new solutions to take our efforts to reduce our emissions one step further. Our environmental transition is demanding and complex, but it is not an option. Air France is determined to explore all the avenues of innovation used by the other airlines in the SkyTeam alliance, which share its ambition to make air transport compatible with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.”

The figures, such as the level of reduction in CO 2 emissions for each of the levers activated, as well as the feedback from customers present on both flights will be analysed. This information will be used to consider the most appropriate ways of limiting the carbon footprint of Air France’s scheduled operations in the future.

These findings will be shared with the other SkyTeam alliance airlines that took part in the Skyteam Sustainable Flight Challenge. The entire Air France environmental strategy can be consulted on the dedicated website.

Air France actions implemented at each stage of the trip:

Before the flight :

A message is sent to customers to ask them to limit the volume and weight of their baggage. In order to limit food waste, they are encouraged to pre-select their meals so only the necessary products are loaded on board;

In the lounges, more sustainable, local and seasonal products are offered and eco-responsible materials are used;

Fully electric ground operations, with electric push-back of the aircraft, transport of crews by electric bus between their base and the aircraft parking stand and electric transport of cargo.

Navy unveils climate action strategy but glosses over carbon emissions from ships and planes,"An ambitious plan to make the U.S. Navy greener aims to raise the energy efficiency of the service’s ground vehicles, boost its supply of lithium batteries and install cyber-secure microgrids, among other goals.

But there’s a glaring omission in the strategy. It lists no emission-reduction targets for the Navy’s ships and planes, which account for the bulk of the department’s carbon dioxide output, and are widely regarded as the hardest to decarbonize because of the amount of energy they require and the missions they perform.

Still, the Navy says in its new plan that it should be able to reduce its overall emissions by 65% by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The term means some greenhouse gases are released but are offset by the removal of an equivalent amount of the gases from the atmosphere.

Unveiled Tuesday, Climate Action 2030 commits the Navy to exploring electrification, alternative low-carbon fuels and advanced propulsion for its land, sea and air vehicles.

“For the Department of Navy, this is existential,” Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said in a forward to the strategy. “Our naval forces, the United States Navy and Marine Corps, are in the crosshairs of the climate crisis: the threat increases instability and demands on our forces while simultaneously impacting our capacity to respond to those demands.”

The goals listed meet targets included in an executive order issued last year to all federal agencies by President Joe Biden.

In addition to those targets, the Navy pledged to cut 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2027, which is the equivalent of removing 1 million cars from roads.

The service says it also plans to get all of its electricity through “carbon pollution-free” means by 2030; have a fleet of zero-emission vehicles by 2035; and halve the CO2 emissions from its installations by 2032.

Cyber-secure microgrids are one of the ways the Navy will operate carbon pollution-free power at its installations, the strategy said. Microgrids are small-scale power generators, often creating energy from several sources, that can operate independently or collaboratively.

At the same time, the service would draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and ensure a domestic supply of lithium batteries to help meet its climate goals.

Scientists say rising sea levels, recurrent flooding and more frequent and destructive hurricanes result from man-made climate change and are a particular challenge for the Navy.

“Climate change increases risk, exposes vulnerabilities to our people, installations, platforms, operations, and allies and partners,” Meredith Berger, assistant secretary of the Navy for energy, installations and environment, said in a statement Tuesday.

The Navy says in its strategy that it will equip sailors to operate in a world with more volatile weather. For example, climate threats will be incorporated into war games and training exercises.

The Biden administration’s targets pose a formidable challenge to the Defense Department, which is the world’s largest institutional consumer of petroleum and the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases.

However, DOD says it is taking the threats posed by climate change seriously and released an overarching climate plan in October.",,[],[]
Italian and Croatian Olive Growers Test New Carbon Credit Project,"A three-year-long European Union-funded project has shown that olive, fruit and vine grow­ers can effi­ciently con­tribute to devel­op­ing a car­bon credit mar­ket focused on agri­cul­ture, cre­at­ing new oppor­tu­ni­ties for farm­ers and pro­duc­ing ben­e­fi­cial effects for the envi­ron­ment.

The exper­i­men­tal mar­ket set up by the Green Economy and CO2 project (GECO2) allowed the agri­cul­tural part­ners to mea­sure their car­bon seques­ter­ing capa­bil­i­ties and sell car­bon credit.

Thanks to GECO2, we have ver­i­fied that par­tic­i­pat­ing Italian and Croatian grow­ers sequester around three tons of car­bon per hectare on aver­age. - Giulia Villani and Antonio Volta, GECO2 coor­di­nat­ing team

On the other side of the spec­trum, GECO2 buy­ers in the food sec­tor were allowed to off­set por­tions of their green­house gas emis­sions by buy­ing those cred­its.

Coordinated by Italian and Croatian offi­cials, hun­dreds of farm­ers and entre­pre­neurs on both banks of the Adriatic Sea par­tic­i­pated in the scheme, which encour­aged the adop­tion of many farm­ing best prac­tices.

“Thanks to the best prac­tices in man­ag­ing their ter­ri­tory and the bio­mass, farm­ers who par­tic­i­pated in the project have learned that a vir­tu­ous approach can lead to car­bon cred­its gen­er­a­tion,” Giulia Villani and Antonio Volta, researchers at the Climate Observatory of the Italian Agency for Energy and Environment of Emilia-Romagna and mem­bers of the GECO2 coor­di­nat­ing team, told Olive Oil Times.

“Thanks to GECO2, we have ver­i­fied that par­tic­i­pat­ing Italian and Croatian grow­ers sequester around three tons of car­bon per hectare on aver­age,” they added.

In a note pub­lished by Legacoop, one of the project part­ners, the cooperative’s pres­i­dent, Cristian Maretti, noted how ​“this project high­lights that the cap­ture of car­bon diox­ide is pos­si­ble in agri­cul­ture and gen­er­ates inter­est­ing earn­ings and car­bon cred­its for farm­ers.”

“There is inter­est in sup­port­ing more sus­tain­able agri­cul­tural sup­ply chains, and there­fore there is a poten­tial for the vol­un­tary mar­ket to work,” he added.

The car­bon seques­ter­ing capa­bil­i­ties of every involved farmer were input into the GECO2 algo­rithm, which cal­cu­lated how the vol­umes trans­lated into cor­re­spond­ing cred­its.

“The first tool that the project designed was the car­bon cal­cu­la­tor needed to pro­duce agri­cul­tural-gen­er­ated car­bon cred­its,” Villani and Volta said.

“After that, another cal­cu­la­tor was devel­oped to esti­mate the car­bon emis­sions pro­duced by the GECO2 buy­ers,” they added. ​“In the test project, we have specif­i­cally focused on the emis­sions related to the energy use of the par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies.”

In the third step of the devel­op­ment project, GECO2’s part­ners cre­ated the plat­form where the actual car­bon credit trad­ing occurs.

By answer­ing a ques­tion­naire, par­tic­i­pat­ing farm­ers pro­vide the car­bon cal­cu­la­tor with the rel­e­vant data, such as the slope of the land, soil drainage prop­er­ties and tex­ture and the annual rain­fall.

They also had to list the species and num­ber of per­ma­nent crops and trees grow­ing in their fields, the age of the groves and the height of the trees. Other data requested for the car­bon cal­cu­la­tor included the amount of forestry crops and other veg­e­ta­tion such as shrubs or hedges.

Farmers were also asked to be very spe­cific about the treat­ments used in the field, such as the use of fer­til­iz­ers and other chem­i­cals, how they are used and applied and in what quan­ti­ties they are applied.

They also had to detail the man­age­ment of com­post mate­ri­als describ­ing the ori­gin, type and how they are used. At the same time, the farm­ers were also asked to mea­sure their fuel use and energy con­sump­tion.

“One of the lim­its we have met by using the ques­tion­naire is the fact that it might be too detailed, in the sense that it can end up cost­ing farm­ers if it needs to be done for each of their fields,” Villani and Volta said.

“The other limit being that not all farm­ers have all those data, nor did they ever explore spe­cific char­ac­ter­is­tics of their activ­ity,” they added.

On one side, that means that some pro­duc­ers input esti­mates instead of specifics into the cal­cu­la­tor, dis­tort­ing the real­ity of the amount of car­bon sequestered and cor­re­spond­ing cred­its pro­duced.

However, it also allowed farm­ers to thor­oughly review and under­stand the envi­ron­men­tal impacts of their agri­cul­tural oper­a­tions.

Among the data digested by the algo­rithm, a spe­cific space was given to farm­ing best prac­tices.

These included organic farm man­age­ment, appli­ca­tion of soil con­ser­va­tion tillage, use of cover crops, farm man­age­ment with hedges, rows and for­est patches inte­grated into field crops, reuse of wood residues to improve soil, reduced pes­ti­cide deploy­ment and no bio­mass burn­ing.

The farm­ers were also asked which best prac­tices they intended to adopt to par­tic­i­pate in the project.

Over the three years of the project, which ends on May 31, GECO2 involved around 160 farm­ers cov­er­ing 1,877 hectares and con­tribut­ing to 205 exper­i­men­tal fields.

As a whole and for the pro­jec­t’s dura­tion, the par­tic­i­pat­ing agri­cul­tural activ­i­ties stored more than 6,500 tons of green­house gases.

The train­ing phase also included 42 sem­i­nars aimed at farm­ers, busi­nesses, pub­lic admin­is­tra­tions and cit­i­zens.

“GECO2 has seen real trans­ac­tions, which is a rel­e­vant achieve­ment,” Villani and Volta said. ​“Like all E.U‑funded projects, GECO2 is open and acces­si­ble, so the entire mech­a­nism that the project has set up can be stud­ied, widened and applied in other con­texts.”

“One of the requests com­ing from the E.U. is the replic­a­bil­ity, which is the pos­si­bil­ity for oth­ers within the European Union to imple­ment the project and expand it,” they added.

The pro­jec­t’s part­ners hope to have GECO2 pave the way to build a com­pre­hen­sive car­bon credit mar­ket based on agri­cul­ture and con­tribute to the devel­op­ment of E.U.-wide projects.

“By the end of the year, the European Commission should announce an offi­cial car­bon credit cal­cu­lat­ing method­ol­ogy which mem­ber coun­tries will then be able to adopt,” Villani and Volta con­cluded.",,[],"['- Giulia Villani', 'Antonio Volta', 'Coor Di Nat Ing Team']"
Incentivizing zero- and low-emission vehicles: The magic of feebate programs,"Feebates, also called bonus-malus programs in some regions, levy a fee on the purchase of vehicles with high carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions and use the revenues to incentivize the purchase of vehicles with zero or low CO 2 emissions in the form of a rebate. Thereby, governments can help to spur the transition to zero- and low-emission vehicles while disincentivizing the purchase of vehicles with the highest CO 2 emissions. Differing from programs that only rely on incentives, feebates can be designed to be revenue neutral. So, what can other governments take away from established CO2-based feebates? To answer this question, let’s have a look at how feebates have been implemented for cars registered as of June 2022 in France, Singapore, Sweden, and New Zealand.

France has the longest experience with a bonus-malus system, having established its program over 14 years ago. It applies to new and newly imported cars and vans, and the amounts are calculated based on CO2 emissions and, since 2022, also on weight for passenger cars. As shown in the figure below, the bonus for new passenger cars with official CO 2 emissions of 0 g/km is €6,000, while it is €1,000 for cars with emissions up to 50 g/km. The malus tax applies to vehicles emitting 128 g CO 2 /km or more and ranges from €50 to €40,000. The weight component of the malus is €10 per kg for cars weighing between 1,800 kg up to 3,500 kg, exempting battery electric vehicles (BEVs), fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with an all-electric range of more than 50 km. In addition to new cars, a €1,000 bonus applies for purchasers of a used BEV and FCEV at least two years old registered for the first time in France.

Singapore’s feebate has been around for over ten years and applies to new and newly imported used vehicles registered for the first time in Singapore. Rates, which are higher for taxis, depend on CO 2 emission levels in addition to other pollutants. The rebate for cars other than taxis is SG$25,000 (€15,800) if official CO 2 emissions range between 0 and 90 g/km. Cars emitting between 91 and 125 g CO 2 /km receive a rebate of SG$15,000 (€9,500). The fee for higher emitting vehicles is SG$15,000 (€9,500) for cars with CO 2 emissions between 161 g/km and 185 g/km and above emission levels of 185 g CO 2 /km, the one-time fee SG$25,000 (€15,800). As shown in the figure, rates are applied according to a step function, in contrast to the French system which calculates the malus according to a progressive function.

Sweden introduced a bonus-malus system in July 2018. It applies to new cars, motorhomes, light trucks, and light buses. The bonus for a vehicle emitting 0 g CO 2 /km is SEK 70,000 (€6,900). Bonus rates for vehicles with official emission values between 1 and 60 g CO 2 /km decrease linearly from SEK 44,400 (€4,400) to SEK 10,000 (€900). The malus reflects an increased vehicle ownership tax during the first three years of ownership for gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), with diesel vehicles paying higher rates. Malus rates for vehicles first registered from June 2022 increase linearly starting at official emission values of 76 g CO 2 /km.

New Zealand is the latest country to establish a feebate program. The country introduced a rebate for BEVs and PHEVs in July 2021 and expanded the program to a full bonus-malus scheme in April 2022, which applies to new and used imported passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (aka light vehicles) first registered in New Zealand. For new vehicles, the maximum rebate is NZ$8,625 (€5,100) for emissions of 0 g CO 2 /km and NZ$3,423 (€3,400) if official CO 2 emissions range between 1 and 56 g/km. For new vehicles with CO 2 emissions between 56 and 146 g/km the rebate linearly decreases to NZ$654 (€260). The fee for high-emitting new vehicles starts at 192 g CO 2 /km at NZ$259 (€200), linearly going up to NZ$5,175 (€3,100) for cars emitting 276 g CO 2 /km or more. The rebates and fees for used vehicles are reduced by about half.

One main argument in favor of feebates or feebate-like programs is that financial incentives coupled with disincentives can help to spur the transition to zero- and low-emission vehicles and thereby reduce CO 2 emissions from transport. While it is difficult to isolate the effects of one single measure on the average national CO 2 emission levels of new vehicles, there is an indication that these schemes help to stimulate purchases of zero- and low-emission vehicles. In Sweden, registrations of BEVs, which have zero tailpipe emissions, surged to historic highs following the introduction of the bonus-malus scheme, with monthly shares reaching 2%–5% in the last half of 2018, as shown in the figure below, up from an average of 1% in the preceding six months. Increased bonus rates for BEVs and decreased rates for vehicles emitting between 1 and 60 g CO 2 /km, which applies mostly to PHEVs, starting in April 2021 also appear to have helped to spur particularly BEV purchases. Between April 2021 and April 2022, BEV shares of new passenger car registrations ranged between 14% and 36%.

New Zealand’s bonus-malus program also appears to be having a positive effect on electric vehicle registrations. By the end of April 2022, nine months after the introduction of the rebate and one month after the introduction of the fee, registration shares of new battery electric passenger cars have increased significantly, as shown below. Since July 2021, their monthly shares reached historic highs of between 5% and 15% compared to shares of 2% to 4% in the first half of 2021. In April 2022, following the introduction of the full bonus-malus scheme, new registrations of PHEVs and HEVs rose by over 9 and 21 percentage points compared to the previous month, respectively.

Another key argument for feebate programs is that they can be cost neutral if designed carefully. Taking France as an example, the bonus-malus program ran a deficit in the early years, peaking with at over €500 million in 2009. Since 2014, the program has achieved a constant positive balance, even when financing the bonus for scrapping an older car between 2016 and 2018. Hence, the government appears to have managed the bonus-malus without loading the public budget with expenses since 2014.

As shown in France, if designed carefully and reviewed regularly considering market changes, bonus-malus schemes can help the transition to electric vehicles in a revenue-neutral way. The step design of the bonus-malus program in Singapore, in contrast to the progressive curve design used in France, Sweden, and New Zealand, may make it harder for the government to maintain a neutral budget. This is due to manufacturers being able to design vehicles to register type-approval CO 2 emissions just below the step function cut points to qualify for large rebates. When looking at how the programs can positively effect uptake overall, the tighter thresholds affecting most vehicles in Sweden have likely contributed to higher BEV registrations. Additionally, including used vehicles in a feebate scheme as in France, Singapore, and New Zealand can be of additional benefit to reach a broader consumer group such as low-income households.

Overall, feebates can be a crucial policy measure in the transition towards zero- and low-emission vehicles. For countries where the transition to zero-emission vehicles is in full progress, as in Sweden, it is time to think about the next phase, such as how to gradually phase out rebates or bonuses and how to deal with lost fuel tax revenues. But so far, most markets still have a long way to go. Feebates or bonus-malus programs can certainly be one good option to reach this point at a faster pace while helping to spur supply and consumer demand in these markets.",,[],['Sandra Wappelhorst']

Countries mull delaying new EU carbon market in search of climate deal,"European Union countries are considering a one-year delay to the launch of a new European carbon market for buildings and transport, pushing back the start to 2027, as they seek a compromise on more ambitious climate policies, draft documents show.

As the 27-country EU seeks to meet tougher emissions-cutting targets, it is negotiating a raft of laws to put a price on pollution - including an upgrade of its existing carbon market for industry and power plants, and a new scheme to impose CO2 costs on suppliers of fuels used in transport and buildings.

For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.

Negotiators from EU countries will this week consider launching the new market in 2027, according to a draft compromise proposal seen by Reuters. The European Commission, which drafts EU laws, had proposed 2026.

The policy intends to tackle rising transport emissions and the third of EU emissions generated by fossil fuel-guzzling buildings. But it has worried some countries, which - with an eye on recent soaring gas prices - fear it would raise citizens’ energy bills further.

Diplomats said the 2027 launch - which could change during the negotiations - should not undermine the EU’s climate targets, so long as other parts of the proposal were strengthened.

The delay aims to convince hesitant countries, and is earlier than other options countries had discussed, which Brussels had warned could thwart the EU’s green goals.

Revenues from the new carbon market will form a fund to support low-income households.

The proposal, drafted by France which currently chairs meetings of EU countries, would also gradually add shipping to the existing EU carbon market by 2027, a year later than initially planned.

It would maintain other changes to the current carbon market proposed by the Commission, including the rate at which the cap on CO2 permits in the scheme falls each year, and a 2035 phase-out of the free CO2 permits industries receive.

Diplomats will also discuss rules to make it easier to respond to CO2 price spikes, ahead of a meeting later this month where ministers will attempt to agree their stance on the policies, before countries and the EU parliament negotiate the final laws.

EU climate targets: how to decarbonise the steel industry,"Reinvesting in existing CO 2 -intensive assets risks creating stranded assets (having to close down assets before the end of their economic and technical lifetime). The recently published REPowerEU plan reiterated and strongly emphasised the need to accelerate decarbonisation in the EU. Replacing coal, oil and natural gas in industrial processes will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and support international technology leadership.

A new report by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre shows that the EU steel industry is mainly focussing on hydrogen-based steelmaking as a decarbonisation strategy.

Meanwhile the industry is exploring carbon capture technologies, notably in partnership with the chemical industry, as a way to capture and use CO 2 emissions for the production of chemicals.

The report also describes recent efforts by industry players to decarbonise their steel production, draws together information on pilot projects and industry announcements on the deployment of breakthrough steelmaking technologies (hydrogen-based Direct Reduced Iron [DRI] carbon capture technologies and electrolytic reduction of iron ore), and discusses the associated costs and the role of R&D.

Decarbonisation strategies

CO 2 emissions and energy use in European steel production have already been halved since 1960, and the sector aims to achieve further cuts of 80-95% by 2050[2], compared to 1990 levels. Since the conventional Blast Furnace - Basic Oxygen Furnace production route is highly CO 2 -intensive (usually with a carbon footprint of 1.6-2.0 tonnes of CO 2 per tonne of crude steel produced) and most EU steel mills are operating close to optimum efficiency, the industry is increasingly focussing on hydrogen-based steelmaking to decarbonise the sector.

Several projects announced across Europe aim to replace existing steel production processes with new steel plants based on the direct reduction of iron using hydrogen. The REPowerEU plan highlights that around 30% of the primary steel production in the EU is expected to be decarbonised by 2030 using renewable hydrogen.

The cost

In the short-to-medium term, making low-CO 2 steel is likely to be more expensive than current steel production costs. The future costs of hydrogen-based steel production are highly uncertain, since they depend on the future costs of renewable hydrogen and electricity.

The report gathers and compares the results of several external studies that show that with a strong decrease in the costs of renewable hydrogen and an increase in the price of CO 2 emissions, hydrogen-based steelmaking could become competitive with current steelmaking costs by 2050.

Instruments such as carbon contracts for difference (highlighted in the report) could reduce the risks of deploying low carbon technologies by hedging the uncertainty in future carbon costs.

The major investment needed to deploy low-CO 2 steelmaking plants will however need to go hand in hand with investment in the infrastructure required to enable these solutions (renewable electricity and transmission networks, hydrogen related infrastructure or CO 2 transport and storage infrastructure).

The role of R&D

The EU’s ultra-low CO 2 steelmaking (ULCOS) programme, co-funded by the Commission, was instrumental in the early development of decarbonisation technologies for the steel industry. ULCOS brought together 47 partners across the European steel industry and research landscape, and was crucial for assessing and developing low-CO 2 process routes, which were then adopted by industry.

The report presents several indicators showing that the EU industry was a global leader in the early-stage development of technologies. EU R&D programmes played an important supporting role in their early development, but major investments are still needed to support first-of-a-kind demonstration and commercial deployment.

The Clean Steel Partnership, formally launched in June 2021, aims to bring a range of breakthrough technologies for clean steel production up to large-scale demonstration by 2030. The partnership estimates R&D investment needs up to 2030 to be around €2.6 billion. The partnership will be funded under both Horizon Europe and the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, with the EU contributing €700 million towards this mechanism.

The European Commission’s Innovation Fund, financed by the auction revenues of the EU Emissions Trading System, is expected to play an important role in supporting the demonstration of first-of-a-kind low-CO 2 plants.

As part of the REPowerEU plan, the Commission will also roll out carbon contracts for difference under the Innovation Fund to support a full switch of existing hydrogen production in industrial processes from natural gas to renewables and the transition to hydrogen-based production processes in new industrial sectors such as steel-making.

State aid rules on Important Projects of Common European Interest can further boost the implementation of these pilot decarbonisation projects. The European Commission is also facilitating action on research and technology innovation in industry through initiatives bringing together Member States, industry and the research community, such as the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and the ERA Common Industrial Technologies Roadmaps.

A paradigm shift

The report describes the recent paradigm shift among major industry players – globally and especially in the EU – to decarbonise steel production.

The five biggest steelmakers in the world, as well as all the biggest EU steelmakers, have announced decarbonisation targets. In parallel, there is evidence of an emerging market that is willing to pay a green steel premium, as automotive companies are announcing they will use low-CO 2 steel in their vehicle manufacturing. By implementing additional regulatory initiatives to create green markets, such as setting green steel standards and green public procurement, the EU has the opportunity to be a frontrunner in the production of low-CO 2 steel.

Background

The steel sector generates over 330 000 direct jobs and 2.5 million indirect jobs, making it a key part of the EU economy. Steel production in the EU is dominated by a handful of countries. Germany produced 26% of all EU steel in 2020, followed by Italy (15%), France (8%) and Spain (8%). Just over half of all steel produced in the EU in 2020 (56%) was made via the primary route and 44% was made through the recycling route.

Fourteen countries in the EU have primary steelmaking capacities. The smallest such sites in the EU have crude steelmaking capacities of just above 1 million tonnes per year, while the largest sites have capacities of around 10 Mt/year. There are 24 such integrated steelmaking sites in the EU.

Many virtues of wetlands,"Climate change estimates for India indicate rising temperatures, sea-level, intensified rainfall and more catastrophic events. Conservation and wise use of wide diversity of inland and coastal wetlands is a powerful climate change response.

As per recent estimates, wetlands of at least 2.25 ha in size make up 4.86 per cent of country’s geographical area (15.98 million-hectares).

Wetlands assist in stabilisation CO2, CH4, N2O and Green House Gas (GHG) concentrations by minimising climate and land-use-mediated GHG releases and by boosting the potential to actively collect CO2 from the atmosphere and sequester carbon.

The coastal blue carbon soaked by mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses via photosynthesis and stored in wet anaerobic soils has received considerable attention recently in the context of climate change. Peatlands, considered to be one of the world’s largest carbon reserves, are sparse in India and require immediate attention.

Several wetlands can also be a net source of GHGs, and emissions are exacerbated by anthropogenic disturbances, particularly pollution and alteration in water regimes. A crucial predictor of coastal wetlands’ vulnerability is their ability to keep up with rising sea levels. Salt marshes and mangrove swamps are known to accumulate soils vertically.

However, the wetlands change atlas recently published by the Space Application Center indicates declining natural coastal wetlands (reducing from 3.69 million hectare to 3.62 million hectare in last decade).

Areas surrounded by urbanised wetlands are expected to lead to a coastal squeeze in the face of sea-level rise ultimately leading to wetland loss.

Extreme events

Degradation of wetlands diminishes landscapes capability to absorb and moderate floods, droughts, and storm surges.

Floods in the Kashmir Valley in September 2014 and Chennai in December 2015 illustrate how wetland degradation can threaten lives. Integrating wetland conservation and wise use into disaster risk reduction policies and programmes provides “cost-effective” and “no-regrets” options.

India’s emission pledges at the Glasgow summit include net-zero emissions by 2070, reducing carbon emissions by one billion tonnes and reducing the carbon intensity of the economy to less than 45 per cent. Including wetlands blue carbon can assist towards this goal, which is presently overlooked in absence of systematic wetland carbon inventories.

The Environment Ministry supports implementation of management action plans for over 250 wetlands under schemes such as National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems, Mangroves and Coral Reefs, and Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats. Towards her commitment under the Ramsar Convention, India has designated 49 Ramsar sites, and is likely to expand the list to 75 wetlands.

But, even so, the government’s efforts fall short of the rapid degradation of wetlands in virtually all parts of the country. Only a few States have systematically included wetlands within State Climate Action Plans.

Climate change and linked drivers and pressures are highly likely to increase vulnerability of wetlands. Avoidance of impacts to wetlands and associated carbon stocks and processes are likely to be the most effective management strategy for preventing increases in GHG emissions from wetlands.

A first step in this direction would be to include carbon storage and GHG emissions from wetlands within the national carbon stock and flux assessments. A detailed peatland inventory is also much needed.

Secondly, climate risks need to be factored in wetlands management. This can be done by strengthened wetland monitoring systems geared towards identification of climate risk indicators and trends thereof.

Wetlands are also exposed to the risk of maladaptation — the likelihood of adverse impacts on these ecosystems in response to adaptation actions in other sectors. For example, the construction of hydraulic structures to increase freshwater storage in upstream stretches, may further accentuate the risks of salinisation in downstream coastal wetlands.

It is also essential to ensure that conservation action is not led by the role of wetlands in carbon cycles alone, instead takes into account the full range of ecosystem services and biodiversity values of these ecosystems.

HS2 cuts CO2 emissions with the world’s first all-electric drilling rig,"HS2 cuts CO2 emissions with the world’s first all-electric drilling rig

‘First of its kind’ all-electric drilling rig has been enlisted at the HS2 construction site in Warwickshire, cutting 1,292kg of CO2 per day and reducing noise by 50 percent.





HS2 Ltd’s construction partner, Balfour Beatty VINCI Joint Venture (BBV), is currently trialling the world’s first all-electric, high-capacity drilling rig on a construction site in Warwickshire, as the Joint Venture steps up its plans to meet HS2 Ltd’s ambition for diesel-free construction sites.



Andrea Davidson, HS2’s Air Quality Manager, said: “We are proud to be working with our supply chain and leading manufacturers to drive a step-change in the UK construction industry, demonstrating the viability and benefits of emissions-free heavy electric plant.



“Being at the forefront of a ground-breaking trial like this is another step on our journey to achieving our target of all diesel-free construction sites by 2029, and net zero carbon from 2035 – helping HS2 to become the most sustainable infrastructure project ever delivered.”



The 100-tonne BAUER eBG33 drilling rig creates an overall reduction of 1,292kg CO2 per day compared to a traditionally powered rig – and also reduces noise by 50 percent. In terms of performance, the rig is able to carry out exactly the same tasks as a traditional rig.



This innovative new machine is being used by BBV’s deep foundations contractor SB3 (a Joint Venture between Bachy Soletanche & Balfour Beatty Ground Engineering). It works alongside a diesel-powered rig to construct large-diameter piles, with the aim of demonstrating that a heavy, electric-powered construction plant can perform the same tasks as traditional machines.



Tim Laemmle from BAUER Maschinen GmbH, the rig’s developers and manufacturers, said: “We’re thrilled to be leading the industry with this electric rig. It is great to be working with HS2, BBV and SB3, as the first UK specialist contractor to demonstrate the capabilities of the product. We’re fully committed to bringing emission-free equipment to the deep foundation sector. There is a strong desire to promote our new electrified equipment as a genuine, reliable alternative to fossil fuel-driven machinery.”



Chris Merridew, SB3 JV Board Director, concluded: “Our team was eager to support Bauer as the first end user of the electric rig and its new technology. It has the potential to be a massive game changer for the industry and the wider construction sector in our continued drive to reduce carbon, noise and emissions.”



The BAUER eBG33 replaces the diesel engine drive with a powerful electric drive. The environmental benefits include reduced exhaust and noise emissions, high energy efficiency, due to a modern three-phase asynchronous motor, and flexibility through an integrated frequency converter.



BAUER is also trialling different E-connection concepts and an innovative concept for set-up operation via an autonomous secondary drive, which is independent of the power supply.

Ørsted to establish CCS projects at 2 biomass power plants,"By Ørsted | June 14, 2022

ADVERTISEMENT

Ørsted is planning to establish carbon capture at its wood chip-fired Asnæs Power Station in Kalundborg on western Zealand and at the Avedøre Power Station’s straw-fired boiler in the Greater Copenhagen area. The technology and logistics for handling and storing carbon from the two CHP plants are in place, and if financial support is obtained from the current tender for carbon capture and storage, Ørsted can be ready to capture and store 400,000 metric tons of carbon as early as 2025, which is also the objective of the political agreement on carbon capture and storage (CCS).

“With carbon capture at the Asnæs and Avedøre CHP plants, we’ll be able to capture 400,000 metric tons of carbon from 2025, which can be stored in the North Sea. This will contribute significantly to realizing the politically decided climate target for 2025,” says Ole Thomsen, senior vice president, Ørsted.

Establishing carbon hubs

The two CHP plants boast the best possible infrastructure, as they are linked to the grid and the district heating system and have their own harbors. Thus, they can act as hubs for the handling and shipping of both carbon and green fuels. Ørsted’s CHP plants will not only serve as hubs for the capture and shipping of its own carbon, but also for shipping carbon produced by other players. In Kalundborg, Ørsted is, amongst others, in dialogue with Kalundborg Refinery about the possibility of capturing carbon from the oil refinery and piping it to Asnæs Power Station, before sailing it away for storage.

“Our carbon capture plans are based on our newest CHP plants which will be in operation for many years to come, and which run on sustainable straw and wood chips. The CHP plants are uniquely placed, as they have access to all the components which are needed for either capturing and shipping carbon or for using the carbon to produce green fuels, which can then be shipped from the CHP plants’ own harbors. And it’s already become evident how other companies with captured carbon can use our hubs as well. Kalundborg Refinery is the first potential partner, but there are several other players with carbon emissions where we also see a potential for collaboration,” says Thomsen. “The entire supply chain is already in place, so the first volumes can be shipped and stored from 2025.”

Niels Bech, director for business development at Kalundborg Refinery, says, “The potential CCS partnership with Ørsted fits well with Kalundborg Refinery’s ambitions for a green transition. With this project we will be able to reduce our CO2-emissions significantly already in 2025, and we look forward to collaborating on CCS and thereby contributing to this technology being developed on a commercial scale for the benefit of Danish companies and the climate.”

Asnæs Power Station and Kalundborg Refinery will focus on carbon capture and storage, while the straw-fired boiler at Avedøre Power Station has been designated for capturing and delivering some of the carbon to the initial phases of the Power-to-X project ‘Green Fuels for Denmark’ where the ambition is to develop green fuels for the shipping and aviation industries. Consequently, the straw-fired boiler at Avedøre Power Station will be able to deliver carbon for storage and for Power-to-X and to function as a hub for other players with carbon emissions in the Greater Copenhagen area.

Switching to primarily Danish biomass

Ørsted’s carbon capture plans are concentrated on the newest CHP plants with many years of operation left. They are fueled by sustainable straw and wood chips. Ørsted estimates that, in future, it will be possible to meet the need for sustainable biomass for the company’s CHP plants from straw and wood chips primarily from Denmark and neighboring countries in the Baltic region. Therefore, Ørsted has decided to reduce the use of imported wood chips from 2030, as the existing wood chip-fired boilers reach the end of their service lives, and the process of increasing the proportion of Danish wood chips at the wood chip-fired power stations has already been initiated. From the mid-2030s, Ørsted expects to primarily use Danish biomass as fuel for its boilers.

Biomass consumption in Denmark will decrease in line with the increasing electrification of heat generation. According to the Danish Energy Agency, Denmark will, however, continue to need a certain amount of sustainable biomass – in combination with heat pumps, electric boilers, and Power-to-X plants – to maintain the high level of reliability of supply that Danes are accustomed to. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain a supply chain of sustainable wood chips and straw.

“Our forecasts show that we’ll basically be able to meet our needs for biomass with straw and wood chips from Denmark and, to some extent, from neighboring countries in the Baltic region, as our wood chip-fired CHP plants reach the end of their service lives. We’ll still only source certified wood chips from production forests that supply materials for the wood and furniture industries because we need to ensure that our demand for Danish wood chips doesn’t result in less untouched forest in Denmark or have a negative impact on forest biodiversity,” says Thomsen.

Until the wood chip-fired CHP plants reach the end of their service lives, Ørsted will continue to only use certified wood chips that are produced from sawdust and other wood residues from sustainably managed forests.

“Foreign wood pellets and wood chips are still a good and climate-friendly energy source when coming from certified sustainably managed forests. However, it makes a lot of sense to primarily use biomass from areas which are closer to home and thus get as close as possible to the supply chains to reduce the need for transport,” concludes Thomsen.

Dirt First,"IN THE SPRING, the fields of flowers at Harborview Farms cause drivers to pull off the road to take pictures. ""It's unbelievable the amount of people who will compliment me on my flowers,"" Trey Hill says as we walk through a field of rapeseed. A few weeks earlier, Hill tells me, this was all corn.

Like his father before him, Hill is a commodity farmer. He grows corn, soy, and wheat on 10,000 acres in northern Maryland, chasing yields with genetically engineered seeds and herbicides. Unlike his father, Hill also has one foot in an entirely different world: regenerative agriculture.

Hill's introduction to the practice came in the early 2000s (though he didn't hear the phrase regenerative agriculture until a decade later). A group of environmentalists approached him and asked whether he would be willing to experiment with planting cover crops after the harvest to help stabilize the soil and keep fertilizer out of Chesapeake Bay. Hill thought it was a stupid idea. The Chesapeake was polluted—but by factories and industrial-scale poultry operations, not by Harborview. He was already measuring the levels of phosphorus and nitrogen in his soils and applying fertilizer only where and when he was supposed to. But the State of Maryland was willing to pay for the experiment, and Hill figured he had nothing to lose.

Two decades later, Hill is still putting in cover crops—the state pays farmers as much as $80 per acre to plant them. Much to his surprise, the practice has also brought him a lot of joy. ""It's kind of bringing farming for me . . ."" Hill pauses for a second here. ""Not bringing it back,"" he continues, hesitating. Harborview is still a conventional farm. But there's just something about cover cropping compared with the rigid science of growing for the commodity market. Hill experiments with different seed mixtures in different areas, checks in with fellow growers and researchers for advice, and loves the trial and error of it. ""When you start doing this, it's, 'Oh shit, not sure what's gonna happen,' right? 'But it's gonna be fun.'""

Hill and other cover croppers may soon have company. Regenerative agriculture—also called regenerative farming and now carbon farming in more climate-focused circles—has become very buzzy in recent years. In their most recent report, scientists with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that ""soil carbon sequestration in croplands and grasslands"" worldwide could store as much as 8.6 billion tons of CO2 annually—an amount equivalent to roughly 1.5 times the United States' annual emissions. In the early days of the Biden administration, Democratic Georgia representative David Scott, the chair of the House Agriculture Committee, opened a hearing on climate change with a clip from Kiss the Ground, a documentary in which Gisele Bündchen, Woody Harrelson, and soil scientist Ray Archuleta tell viewers that they can stop the climate crisis by supporting regenerative agriculture. ""There's so much bad news about our planet,"" Harrelson intones over footage of a desiccated landscape. ""This is a story of a simple solution. A way to heal our planet. The solution is right under our feet, and it's as old as dirt.""

A few months later, in his first address to Congress, President Joe Biden not only promised to tackle climate change but also enumerated exactly how the administration might do it. On the list was ""farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.""

Politically, regenerative agriculture is a rare creature—one of the few forms of carbon sequestration that have attracted significant bipartisan support. But while dirt may be old, the science of how to persuade it to store carbon isn't.

The term regenerative agriculture was popularized by publisher and organic-farming advocate Robert Rodale in the 1980s. Rodale did not get into specifics, merely saying that regenerative-farming methods enhance the ""land and soil biological production base."" Definitions have only proliferated since then. Some characterize regenerative agriculture by result (amount of carbon sequestered or level of soil fertility). Others see it as a set of processes, like planting cover crops, eliminating tillage, rotating crops, and integrating livestock to fertilize fields. When researchers at the University of Colorado surveyed 229 scientific papers that mentioned regenerative agriculture, they found that while use of the phrase had gained momentum since 2018, there was very little agreement as to what it meant, beyond vague goals like ""improve soil health,"" ""reduce or eliminate tillage,"" and ""integrate livestock.""

The study authors saw this lack of a common definition as a challenge for several reasons. It's tough for researchers to study something and test its proponents' claims if they can't agree on what it is first. Consumers get confused about what they're buying, and it's easier for a term with a vague definition to become watered down or corrupted, despite the ideals of the earliest practitioners. And finally, it's difficult to develop and advocate for laws and policies supporting something whose definition is so mutable.



IN 2018, HILL was approached by a Seattle-based carbon-trading company called Nori. Two years earlier, he had converted all of his acreage to no-till farming. Nori crunched some numbers using a model based on COMET (a tool developed by the US Department of Agriculture and Colorado State University to calculate greenhouse gas emissions), gauged Harborview's carbon-sequestration potential, and came up with an offer. If Hill signed up with the company and planted more cover crops, Nori would pay him $15 per ton of carbon sequestered and credit him retroactively for the carbon stored owing to his switch to no-till.

That first year, Hill made $115,000 for storing an estimated 8,000 metric tons of carbon. That's not a huge amount considering the extra work involved—it's less than he gets from the state for cover cropping. But it's enough of an incentive that Hill has been enrolling more acreage in Nori to increase the payout.

Nori is one of several outfits that are paying farmers to store carbon and then selling it as offsets to individuals and companies that want to brand themselves as sustainable. Some of these offset sellers are run by heavy hitters in the ag world: Bayer, Corteva, Farmers Business Network, and Truterra (the last is an offshoot of Land O'Lakes). The carbon-offset market tends to draw large farms like Harborview rather than small ones, since there's more of a payoff for the upfront paperwork and meticulous crop tracking when you have thousands of acres as opposed to a couple hundred. The price for carbon credits in the United States fluctuates, but $15 to $20 per ton of carbon sequestered is common.

Carbon markets first came to global attention during talks leading up to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The international treaty to lower greenhouse gas emissions allowed countries to invest in projects in developing countries to avert or sequester carbon emissions, gaining offsets in return. Kyoto didn't specify what the carbon market would look like, and trading never happened under the treaty. But in its wake, multiple private and public carbon markets appeared. In some of these, a private organization served as the intermediary, much like a stock exchange.

The credits bought and sold by Kyoto participants were verified by one of a handful of third-party organizations. Two requirements were particularly important to the verification process: permanence (a carbon offset needs to keep the removed carbon out of the atmosphere for a specific period of time, usually 100 years) and additionality (the carbon credits need to represent emissions reductions that would not have happened otherwise).

One of the privately operated carbon markets to emerge in the wake of Kyoto was the Chicago Climate Exchange, which launched in 2003 with offsets that included no-till farms. It folded in 2010, after it became clear that most investors were not interested in a voluntary market and were waiting for the federal government to step in. When climate legislation failed to go through the Senate, the market folded. But that hasn't stopped a new crop of carbon brokers from emerging in recent years. Last year, Microsoft purchased offsets for 100,000 tons of its carbon emissions from Truterra. PepsiCo announced that it would adopt regenerative-farming practices ""across 7 million acres""—including farms growing potatoes for Lay's and oats for Quaker—resulting in ""a net-reduction of at least 3 million tons of GHG emissions by 2030."" Cargill, which controls 18 percent of the domestic meat market, announced that it will reduce emissions from its beef supply chain by persuading its wheat, corn, and soy growers to adopt no-till and cover cropping. It estimated that this would sequester 1.7 million tons of carbon by 2030.

In May 2021, USDA leadership announced $10 million in funding to improve the way the department measures soil carbon sequestration on farms. One goal is ""strengthening"" COMET (the acronym stands for CarbOn Management and Emissions Tool), which was first developed for farmers as a way to qualify for state conservation grants.

The announcement came a few months before I spoke with Adam Chambers, the USDA climate scientist who designed COMET in partnership with Colorado State University. Chambers walked me through how it works, selecting a state, then a county, then a series of cover crops. ""If that's a nonleguminous, seasonal cover crop on an irrigated system, and then we put in 180 acres of cover crops, we sequester 29 tons in a given year,"" he told me. ""It's that simple.""

It did sound simple. But how did he know that 29 tons was an accurate estimate? The projections are extrapolated from a database of peer-reviewed long-range studies measuring carbon-sequestration efforts, Chambers told me.

But here's the catch: The science behind the studies that the database is built on is incredibly contentious.



IF YOU WANT to measure how much carbon is sequestered in a way that is considered authoritative for soil carbon markets, one method is to take several pounds of dirt (sometimes hundreds of pounds of dirt) out of a field and mail it to a lab that will blow it up to detect the carbon. Those lab numbers won't tell you about an entire field, though, says Hill, because carbon doesn't distribute itself evenly through a landscape. ""You could take a sample here,"" he says, pointing to an area of the field where the rapeseed is particularly dense. ""And then you see my cover crop didn't come up there, and you take a sample there. It's going to be completely different.""

Carbon levels in soil vary depending on where you sample horizontally. They also vary depending on how deep you sample vertically. Soil scientists once believed that carbon could become permanently locked into soils in the form of large, stable, carbon-rich molecules, but the consensus has shifted: All soil carbon breaks down eventually, just at different rates depending on the depth.

Carbon sequestered at lower depths won't stay there forever, but it can stick around for thousands of years. That persistence is why unplowed wild savannas and rainforests serve as massive carbon reserves. Scientists don't fully understand how these deeper carbon stores form. One explanation is that they're less subject to decomposition by the microbes that feed on carbon and breathe it back into the atmosphere as CO2.

Carbon in the top 30 centimeters (about 12 inches) of soil is far more fickle. Massive amounts of carbon go into and out of agricultural soils every year for all sorts of reasons. (Most no-till farmers still plow every one to three years, for example.) There's no consensus about whether it's possible to get that highly cyclical carbon to stay where it is. And in recent years, some research has cautioned that increasing global temperatures might reduce soil carbon sequestration. As temperatures increase, microbes in the soil tend to release carbon. The closer these microbes are to the soil's surface, the more carbon that escapes into the atmosphere.

Over a decade ago, a team of scientists at the University of Minnesota and the USDA Agricultural Research Service in St. Paul published an article in the journal Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment that pointed out that a significant number of studies making carbon-sequestration claims about no-till farming were based on samples collected from the top 30 centimeters. One 30-year comparison of no-till and tilled plots run by CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, found that shifting a plot from tillage to no-till did not increase the carbon sequestered by that soil significantly. John Kirkegaard, an agronomist at CSIRO, has a working theory that microbes near the soil's surface are nitrogen-hungry, just like plants. If there isn't an abundance of nitrogen for them to devour, they'll break down existing organic matter in the soil instead, releasing some of the carbon stored there in the process.

Applying nutrients in the form of manure, often by adding livestock, is a big part of regenerative agriculture. Hill uses manure from local poultry farms at Harborview but is limited in how much he can apply by state laws. Add too much nitrogen and it will leach into nearby waterways, throwing aquatic ecosystems out of balance. Not only that, but applying manure is associated with nitrous oxide emissions, another greenhouse gas pollutant.

While the science behind carbon farming is speculative, the emissions it aims to offset are far more certain. The US food system is responsible for about 10 percent of the country's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the EPA, and that percentage would be much larger if it weren't for the outsize energy use of other sectors.

Agriculture also uses a lot of land. All landscapes have a ""carbon opportunity cost,"" says Tim Searchinger, a researcher who studies food systems and climate change at Princeton University. Even the best managed cover crop can't match the carbon-storage capacity of a forest or prairie or wetland ecosystem, and so any area that is used for growing crops sacrifices some higher amount of potential carbon storage. That trade-off is necessary to make sure people are fed. But, he argues, we need to limit further farmland expansion to keep emissions from getting even higher.



THE REFRAIN THROUGHOUT Kiss the Ground is that regenerative agriculture is a solution to climate change because it's bringing livestock back onto the farm, where their manure can fertilize the soil and help it store carbon instead of polluting a waterway somewhere else. Or, as Gabe Brown, one farmer featured in the film, puts it, ""The problem isn't the animal. The problem is where the animals are at."" Brown raises livestock using a method called mob grazing—popular with many regenerative farmers—whereby animals are moved daily from one area to the next via a system of gates and fences to keep the fields from becoming overgrazed.

But for every farm and livestock operation to run this way, we'd have to do something extremely unpopular—something that Kiss the Ground never mentions. We'd have to eat less beef. A lot less. Even less than environmental groups like the World Resources Institute and Project Drawdown already recommend.

Denmark, Finland, and Iceland are updating their nutrition recommendations to encourage a more climate-friendly diet—one that includes less meat. The last time the US updated its dietary guidelines, a plan to add similar language was scuttled, thanks to meat and dairy industry influence. North Americans eat three times more beef than the global average. The US beef industry as a whole manages an inventory of 93.6 million cows and calves, and land for animal farming in the US already takes up more than 400 million acres. The US could not convert to regenerative grazing practices and produce the amount of meat we eat now without using more than twice as much land.

Even if you take livestock out of the equation, there's no question that cover crops, no-till, and crop rotation are good for soil health, says Deb O'Dell, a soil scientist and adjunct assistant professor at the University of Tennessee. The USDA already pays farmers to restore wetlands and to not farm landscapes that are important habitat for certain plant and animal species. But these programs don't always have the funding for everyone who wants to participate. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program, for example, can fund only about 25 percent of applicants. Expanding these programs would not be a stretch. Call it ""ecosystem services,"" O'Dell says. Consider it economic aid to rural areas struggling with poor water quality. Even if there are no climate benefits at all, holding on to your topsoil makes good sense.

Checking up on farmers to make sure they're following through on ecosystem services is also easier than monitoring soils. Satellite imagery, drones, and other remote sensing tools can identify farmers who burn or till their fields or fail to plant a cover crop.

Searchinger sees carbon farming as a distraction. ""If you're actually serious about solving climate change, the first thing you do is you start trying to restore your peatlands,"" he says. At the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, in North Carolina, one restored-peatlands project is storing 70 million pounds of carbon and 2.2 million pounds of nitrogen per year. ""There's no technical uncertainty,"" Searchinger says. ""So why aren't we doing it?""



IN FEBRUARY, THE USDA launched Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities—offering $1 billion in funding to organizations that develop systems to help farmers ""quantify, monitor, and verify"" reduced emissions from carbon sequestration.

In March, the House Agriculture Committee held another hearing on climate change, this one in anticipation of the 2023 farm bill, which will set agricultural policy for the next five years. There was the usual debate over whether agricultural emissions are a thing—basically an ""Is Climate Change Real 2.0."" (Spoiler: Yes.) Republican Pennsylvania representative Glenn Thompson and Joe Outlaw, an economist at Texas A&M University, worried that developing climate programs would create ""winners and losers,"" as though USDA policies don't already do that.

Alma Adams, a Democratic representative from North Carolina, was the only elected official present who mentioned the Paris climate accord. ""Unless there's a real systemic change,"" she said, ""we now know that emissions from agriculture will make it impossible to achieve the Paris Agreement of limiting global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius."" It was hard to say which possibility was more ominous—that carbon farming would progress to become a tool for greenwashing on a national scale or that the United States would continue to do nothing to rein in the sector that generates a 10th of its greenhouse gas emissions.

That greenwashing is already a reality, according to research by Sonali McDermid, Jennifer Jacquet, and Oliver Lazarus, three researchers at New York University. Out of the 35 largest global meat and dairy companies in the world, only six have made zero-emissions commitments. None of those companies are making substantial changes in the way they do business. Meat companies are feeling pressure to show some kind of action on climate, Jacquet says. Regenerative agriculture is a way to draw attention away from climate policies that would cut into profits, like eliminating USDA subsidies for livestock and the crops that are grown to feed them.

To Matthew Hayek, an environmental scientist at NYU, the way we talk about the agriculture industry is similar to conversations about the oil industry 25 years ago—directing attention away from the pollution it is causing by focusing on a new technology instead of old problems. ""We were talking about coal with carbon capture, and there was really amazing and promising research into carbon capture and sequestration,"" Hayek says of those early discussions about cutting carbon emissions. It wasn't enough. ""That research was critical. But it was never a silver bullet.""

The same could be said for regenerative agriculture. Cover cropping, crop rotation, and reduced tillage do store some carbon. That's why Project Drawdown includes it in the mix of its encyclopedic rundown of climate solutions. But it's important not to overhype it, says Chad Frischmann, Project Drawdown's head of research. ""We should be constructively critical of these solutions,"" he says. ""Always. Because some of these solutions may not be solutions tomorrow, right? And there may be new solutions that come along that we find that are even better.""

EU’s CO2 footprint continues to decrease - Products Eurostat News,"In 2019, the EU emitted around 3.1 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO 2 , less than 9% of the worldwide CO 2 emissions for that year. Consumption in the EU was responsible for 3.4 Gt of CO 2 emissions, representing 10% of global CO 2 emissions.

Using the FIGARO Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) model, Eurostat estimates the volume of CO 2 emitted in the rest of the world serving the EU consumption at 0.9 Gt, while around 2.5 Gt were emitted by the EU production system for EU consumption.

Source dataset: Eurostat estimates

On the other hand, almost 0.6 Gt CO 2 were emitted by the EU economy for the production of goods that were exported to the rest of the world. This means that in 2019, the emissions embodied in imported goods and services were higher than the emissions embodied in the EU’s exports, making the EU a net importer of embodied CO 2 emissions.

Compared with 2010, the balance has improved on EU’s side. While CO 2 emissions in the EU embodied in exported goods are estimated to be stable (0.6 Gt), CO 2 emissions generated outside the EU for its consumption decreased by about 8%, from almost 1.0 Gt in 2010 to 0.9 Gt in 2019. Thanks to a similar reduction of CO 2 emissions for goods and services produced in the EU for domestic consumption, the EU’s total CO 2 footprint decreased from 4.0 Gt in 2010 to 3.6 Gt in 2018 and then to 3.4 Gt in 2019. It’s important to note that at the same time, EU’s consumption of goods and services increased, which means that the EU production system managed to produce more goods and services with less CO 2 emitted.



Source dataset: Eurostat estimates



Most CO 2 emissions imported for EU consumption emitted in China, Russia and the United States

Around 0.9 Gt of global CO 2 emissions serving EU consumption originated from non-EU countries in 2019. China was the most important source of these CO 2 emissions, representing 27% of the total emissions in the rest of the world and reflecting its role as the EU’s main trading partner for imports. Russia accounted for 0.11 Gt CO 2 emissions (12%) followed by the United States (8%) and India (6%).

In absolute terms, imported emissions from these countries decreased between 2010 and 2019, except for those from India.

Moderate progress on SDG13 – climate action

Eurostat published yesterday the 2022 monitoring report on progress towards the SDGs in an EU context, which shows that over the last five years the climate action goal (SDG 13) has had moderate progress. This goal calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C – preferably to 1.5°C – compared with pre-industrial times.

German sustainability startup turning waste product into green hydrogen,"Cate Lawrence is an Australian tech journo living in Berlin. She focuses on all things mobility: ebikes, autonomous vehicles, VTOL, smart ci (show all) Cate Lawrence is an Australian tech journo living in Berlin. She focuses on all things mobility: ebikes, autonomous vehicles, VTOL, smart cities, and the future of alternative energy sources like electric batteries, solar, and hydrogen.

There are many great use cases of hydrogen fuel cells powering vehicles like trucks, buses, ships, trains, aircraft, and to a lesser extent, cars.

While hydrogen is a green substance in action — much like green electricity — it’s sourcing historically isn’t. In 2020, 96% of the hydrogen used was produced based on fossil energy sources. But now, a German company has found a way to convert waste into usable green hydrogen that can generate power.

Remind me how you make hydrogen?

Energy providers most commonly extract hydrogen from water using heat and chemical reactions. However, this is traditionally an energy-intensive process that, unless it includes the use of renewable energies, generates harmful greenhouse gas emissions.

Hi there, EV nerd! Subscribe now for a weekly recap of our favorite mobility stories

But German energy storage company H2-Industries announced the construction of Egypt’s first waste-to-hydrogen facilities and the world’s first project of its type.

The company is developing a project to convert organic waste from the Suez Canal Economic Zone into usable hydrogen. This includes plastic, agricultural waste, and sewage sludge

The company will transfer this hydrogen into a “carrier fluid” to transport and use to fill storage tanks much like diesel, but without the respective carbon emissions.

Then, energy providers can use waste heat from the H2-Industries’ process to generate power with steam turbines and generators.

Amazing stuff.

Huge price drops for green hydrogen production

According to the company, the project targets a production capacity of 300,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year. This means that the power plant can dispose of four million tonnes of municipal solid waste annually.

Importantly, one of the big wins for evolving green hydrogen is cost. Price is traditionally a massive barrier in advancing green hydrogen innovation.

The Suez Canal Project will produce green hydrogen at half the cost of current production technologies, taking the cost even lower than current levels for low-carbon and grey hydrogen production.

Furthermore, the CO2 emissions captured in the processing could create low-cost synthetic diesel (eDiesel) or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

In-vehicle hydrogen fuel cell tech

It’s fair to say that green hydrogeninnovation is concentrated currently in research and development than in commercial use cases.

But a project of this scale makes commercial viability closer to reality. Hopefully, other stakeholders in the space can use the project findings to drive their own sustainable green hydrogen projects further.

Without this (and the necessary hydrogen refueling stations), we’ll never get beyond research to real use cases.",,[],"['Cate Lawrence', 'Story By']"
"Office Building in Australia to Be Covered in ‘Solar Skin’ of More Than 1,000 Panels","An eight-story high-rise planned for West Melbourne, Australia will sport 1,182 solar panels on its facade, which, along with a rooftop solar array, will provide the building with nearly all of its power.

“These things are possible, and the fact that a building can harness the sunlight from its own skin — it sounds like something you dreamed of, or you saw in a cartoon,” architect Pete Kennon told The Guardian.

The “solar skin” will be supplied by Avancis, a German firm producing glass panels containing solar cells. From the outside, the panels will look like an ordinary facade, but they will generate 50 times as much power as the typical home rooftop solar array, eliminating an estimated 70 metric tons of CO2 emissions each year.

The $40 million office building will be the first in Australia to use such panels, though several projects in Europe have been built with the technology, including the world’s largest wooden skyscraper in Skellefteå, Sweden.

“It feels urgent to innovate our building technologies to more sustainable methods,” Kennnon told Fast Company. “Collecting solar is a natural trajectory on our large-scale projects, particularly in locations that have great access to sunlight.”

Hindustan Zinc Continues to Set the Bar High for the Pursuit of Zero Emissions,"Hindustan Zinc recognises today’s sobering reality about the environment, and it stands to play an important role in the pursuit of a healthier environment. The company is accelerating its efforts to raise environmental awareness and drive better action in this direction. In addition to its pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the company has embraced myriad other technology-driven and innovative initiatives aimed at the well-being of the environment.

Hindustan Zinc is acutely aware of the impact climate change has on the planet. Taking the same into consideration, the company has taken several initiatives to reduce the risk of climate change as a part of its sustainability development goals. One of their many environmentally conscious efforts includes keeping a close eye on the company’s carbon footprint along with efforts to reduce it. Furthermore, the company also prioritises sustainable policies and endeavours for the conservation of natural resources across its supply chain.

Pioneering a new era in mining operations

The continued environmental sustainability efforts have also led to the company teaming up with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) forums. Based on TCFD recommendations, Hindustan Zinc has aligned its reporting process with the global best practices for climate reporting. Driven by the belief that biodiversity conservation is also an important aspect of environment-conservation efforts at Hindustan Zinc.

The ‘Business Ambition for 1.5°C’ campaign is backed by a global coalition of UN leaders, business organizations, and NGOs. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which leads the campaign, drives ambitious climate action in the private sector by enabling companies to set science-based emission reduction targets.

Hindustan Zinc has also set up a long-term group captive renewable power development plan with a capacity of 200 MW. This Build Own Operate (BOO) project, will be based on Group Captive guidelines, with Hindustan Zinc contributing up to INR 350 crore. This project is expected to begin delivering electricity within 24 months of the Power Delivery Agreement (PDA) being signed.

Striving for an electric future

Electric vehicles (EVs) are a globally recognised means to alleviate dependence on petroleum products and reduce CO2 emissions. Therefore, Hindustan Zinc signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Epiroc Rock Drills AB, Normet Group Oy and Sandvik AB to introduce battery electric vehicles (BEV) in its underground mining operations. This makes Hindustan Zinc the first company in India to introduce battery-operated vehicles in underground mines. This partnership will allow Hindustan Zinc to replace diesel-powered equipment with electric vehicles, thus enabling safer and cleaner mining operations.

Along with the MoUs with leading equipment manufacturers the company has also deployed passenger EV vehicles, EV forklifts and EV light motor vehicles in its operations.

Sustain biodiversity throughout the life cycle.

Hindustan Zinc's commitment to the environment and sustainability is one of the company's core principles. For all its operations, the Organization has developed a one-of-a-kind and unique biodiversity management plan. The company is also a member of the IUCN Leader for Nature (LfN) India initiative, and it is committed to maintaining and restoring biodiversity.

To reduce its environmental footprint year after year, Hindustan Zinc makes every effort to conserve natural resources and deploy greener technology whenever possible. Hindustan Zinc is currently 2.41 times water positive and aims to enhance it to 5 times. The company is developing huge zero liquid discharge plants at all its smelters and mines thus reiterating its commitment to Zero Discharge from operations. All mining water pumped out of the mines will be treated and made available to their plants. Hindustan Zinc is currently investing approximately 400-500 crores in various water treatment plants, and it will continue upon the journey.",,[],[]

The 1977 White House climate memo that should have changed the world,"In 1977 Star Wars hit movie theaters, New York City had a blackout that lasted 25 hours, and the Apple II personal computer went up for sale. It was also the year that a remarkable one-page memo was circulated at the very highest levels of US government.

Years before the climate crisis was part of national discourse, this memo outlined what was known – and feared – about the crisis at the time. It was prescient in many ways. Did anyone listen?

By July 1977, President Jimmy Carter had only been in office for seven months, but he had already built a reputation for being focused on environmental issues. For one, by installing solar panels on the White House. He had also announced a national renewable energy plan .

“We must start now to develop the new, unconventional sources of energy we will rely on in the next century,” he said in an address to the nation outlining its main goals.

The climate memo arrived on his desk a few days after the Independence Day celebrations on July 4. It has the ominous title “Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change.”

One of the first thing that stands out is the stamp at the top, partially elided, saying THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN.

The memo’s author was Frank Press, Carter’s chief science adviser and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press was a tall, serious, geophysicist who had grown up poor in a Jewish family in Brooklyn, and was described as “brilliant” by his colleagues. Before working with the Carter administration, he had been director of the Seismological Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, and had consulted for federal agencies including the Navy and NASA.

“Carter had a great respect for Frank [Press] and for science,” said Stu Eizenstat, who served as Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser from 1977 to 1981.

Press starts the memo by laying out the science of the climate crisis as it was understood at the time.

Fossil fuel combustion has increased at an exponential rate over the last 100 years. As a result, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is now 12 percent above the pre-industrial revolution level and may grow to 1.5 to 2.0 times that level within 60 years. Because of the “greenhouse effect” of atmospheric CO2 the increased concentration will induce a global climatic warming of anywhere from 0.5 to 5°C.

These far-sighted assertions were in line with the climate science that originated the previous decade, when the US government funded major science agencies focused on space, atmospheric and ocean science. Research produced for President Lyndon B Johnson in 1965 found that billions of tons of “carbon dioxide is being added to the earth’s atmosphere by the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas”.

Press’s memo was on the mark. In 2021, for the first time ever, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 reached 420PPM, the halfway point to the doubling of pre-industrial CO2 levels that Press posited.

The potential effect on the environment of a climatic fluctuation of such rapidity could be catastrophic and calls for an impact assessment of unprecedented importance and difficulty. A rapid climatic change may result in large scale crop failures at a time when an increased world population taxes agriculture to the limits of productivity.

Press was right. We have indeed seen the catastrophic effects of a climatic fluctuation, in the form of increasingly severe weather events including droughts, heatwaves, and hurricanes of greater intensity. Meanwhile, in many parts of the world heating has already stemmed increases in agricultural productivity, and large-scale food production crises are thought to be possible.

The urgency of the problem derives from our inability to shift rapidly to non-fossil fuel sources once the climatic effects become evident not long after the year 2000; the situation could grow out of control before alternate energy sources and other remedial actions become effective.

This is correct. By the 2000s, the effects of the climate crisis had become apparent in some regions in the form of more deadly heat waves and stronger floods and droughts.

Natural dissipation of C02 would not occur for a millennium after fossil fuel combustion was markedly reduced.

This prediction by Press was actually debunked at least a decade ago. Scientists used to believe that some warming was “baked in”, but scientists have since found that as soon as CO2 emissions stop rising, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 levels off and slowly falls.

As you know this is not a new issue. What is new is the growing weight of scientific support which raises the CO2-climate impact from speculation to a serious hypothesis worthy of a response that is neither complacent nor panicky.

But there were other currents mitigating against the sort of response Press calls for. “​​The story of climate policy in the US, generally, is one missed opportunities and unjustifiable delay,” said Jack Lienke, author of the book Struggling for Air: Power Plants and the “War on Coal.”

Many other issues may have seemed more pressing, or simply better understood. As Lienke writes in Struggling for Air, “At a time when Americans were still dying somewhat regularly in acute, inversion-related pollution episodes, it is unsurprising that legislators were more concerned with the known harms of sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide than the uncertain, seemingly distant threat of climate change.”

The authoritative National Academy of Sciences has just alerted us that it will issue a public statement along these lines in a few weeks.

That public statement, released later that month, emphasized the importance of shifting away from fossil fuel energy and highlighted the urgency of starting to transition to new energy sources as soon as possible: “With the end of the oil age in sight, we must make long-term decisions as to future energy policies. One lesson we have been learning is that the time required for transition from one major source to another is several decades.”

So what happened? When Press’s memo made it to the president’s desk, Jim Schlesinger, America’s first secretary of energy, also attached his own note in response:

​​My view is that the policy implications of this issue are still too uncertain to warrant Presidential involvement and policy initiatives.

Carter seems to have heeded this warning, and did not make much progress on climate crisis mitigation during his presidency. Yet he did sign some significant pieces of environmental legislation, including initiating the first federal toxic waste cleanups and creating the first fuel economy standards.

A significant challenge facing Carter was his own contradictory energy aims. Despite his goal of encouraging alternative energy, he also felt there was a national security interest in boosting US oil production in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis.

“We realized our dependence on foreign oil was dangerous and, very importantly, alternative energy was in its infancy,” Eizenstat said. “So Carter was both doing conservation and still encouraging more domestic oil and gas as a way of reducing dependence on foreign oil,” said Eizenstat. “As with all policy, you have conflicting goals.”

Still, it seems possible that if Carter had been re-elected, the world might have been in a better position regarding climate impacts today. One of the first things Reagan did after winning the election in 1981 was take down the White House solar panels. Meanwhile, the fossil fuel industry – whose scientists were already studying the ways that fossil fuels were changing the climate – started spending tens of millions of dollars sowing doubt about climate science.

Did the Press memo accomplish anything at all? For one person it was in fact a “transformational moment” – this was Eizenstat himself. He says it was instrumental in his own future work on the climate crisis, including his decision in 1997 to serve as the United States’s principal negotiator for the Kyoto global warming protocols.

Those protocols set the stage for the first international effort to tackle climate policy on a global level. So even if Press’s memo had a muted impact at the time, his warning wasn’t entirely ignored.",,[],['Emma Pattee']
We must break the link between CO2 emissions and economic growth,"Article originally published on Curation

Its Economics Dashboard says, although energy efficiencies mean the CO2 intensity of GDP has almost halved since 1965, it has improved little since the 1990s because of China’s increased energy consumption.(Fitch Ratings)

Why does this matter?

Since global GDP is expected to continue rising by about 2.5%-3% across the next two decades its critical economies decouple the bond between economic growth and CO2 emissions to prevent the continued effects of climate change.

Weaknesses in current economic models

The use of economic growth as a primary measure of progress adopted by most developed nations has led to extreme inequalities of income combined with unprecedented destruction of the living world.

A recent study found that the majority of global ecological damage resulting from the overuse of natural resources is caused by Europe and the US. The study’s lead author said rich nations should stop focusing on GDP growth as a primary objective, instead prioritising wellbeing and decreasing inequality.

Earlier this year, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also discussed how “degrowth” strategies could be used to increase wellbeing.

What is degrowth?

The degrowth movement argues economies cannot keep growing without driving humanity into climate catastrophe. Degrowth strategies aim to reduce energy consumption by slowing down the growth of economies.

Sustainable degrowth, however, is not equivalent to a recession. Rather, it is about designing economies around meeting human needs instead of perpetual growth. One economic model which aims to do this is the Doughnut Model.

What are Doughnut Economics?

The Doughnut model aims to meet the needs of every individual without overshooting Earth’s ecological ceiling.

Representing this graphically, the “doughnut’s” inner ring is its social foundation which includes basics such as sufficient food and clean water. The outer ring, meanwhile, is the ecological ceiling which includes the nine planetary boundaries.

If we overshoot the doughnut’s boundaries it could lead to consequences, including biodiversity loss and greater air pollution. Unfortunately, we are already exceeding several planetary boundaries.

On the other hand, undershooting the doughnut’s boundary may mean we are unable to ensure people have access to education or essential healthcare.

Has there been adoption of Doughnut Economics?

Yes, Amsterdam has adopted the Doughnut model as framework to guide its social and economic recovery from the pandemic. Oxfam has published national doughnut reports on how far each country is from living within the doughnut’s boundaries.

Have any countries decoupled emissions and GDP growth?

Some have. In April, the IPCC said 18 countries have reduced emissions while growing their economies for at least a decade. One of these countries is the UK – while UK GDP increased by 70% between 1985 and 2016, CO2 emissions fell by 70.7%. This figure does not consider imported emissions, however.

Lateral thought

Encouraging nations to move away from GDP will not be an easy task, especially since perpetual GDP growth also promises higher tax revenue without higher tax rates. However, if we fail to make these changes to tackle the climate crisis GDP, will inevitably be hit by climate change. S&P Global has said that climate change could reduce global GDP by 4% by 2050.

If we continue to exceed the planetary boundaries, we will also suffer the economic consequences of doing so. The World Economic Forum has estimated that half the world’s GDP is highly dependent on nature – if natural systems collapse so could our financial systems.
