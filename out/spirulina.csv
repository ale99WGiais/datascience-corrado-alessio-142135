Why Spirulina Is A Superfood For All-Day Energy,"You may have seen spirulina in powder form or blended up into smoothies (especially those with a gorgeous dark green or bright blue hue). This sea vegetable comes from a type of bacteria called cyanobacterium, which is often referred to as blue-green algae. According to Whitten, ""Spirulina is No. 1 on the list,"" when naming the best foods for your energy levels.

This plant is chock-full of essential vitamins and minerals. In just 1 tablespoon of spirulina, there's 11% of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin B1 (thiamin), 15% of the RDA of vitamin B2 (riboflavin), 21% of the RDA of copper, and 11% of the RDA of iron.

Not to mention, there's been significant research on spirulina's role in performance, specifically physical activity and energy levels. This makes sense, given that spirulina also contains significant amounts of magnesium (which supports muscle and nerve function) and potassium (which aids in muscle contraction).*

Spirulina is also an incredible source of plant-based protein—it's between 55 and 70% protein, in fact. This algae is a particularly great addition to a vegan diet because it's high in vitamin B12, which tends to be harder to find in vegan dishes. A lack of B12 can result in a dip in energy levels, so it's essential for everyone to get their fill.*",,[],[]
Now smoked salmon could be made from spirulina,"If Israeli startup SimpliiGood succeeds in its quest to make smoked “salmon” from nothing but micronutrient-rich spirulina, no fish will be caught, killed and shipped multiple miles to top your bagel.

We know what you’re thinking: how could blue-green algae possibly stand in for smoked salmon in look, taste and texture?

Never fear. SimpliiGood parent company AlgaeCore Technologies already grows and harvests the sea plant to make spirulina-centered food products including vegan burgers and chicken nuggets, popsicles and ice cream, crackers and beverages.

The unique smoked salmon analog, expected to hit the market by the end of 2023, will join this portfolio of products marketed in Israel to food producers and directly to consumers.

SimpliiGood’s texturization platform forms salmon-like chunks from spirulina with the same mouthfeel as the animal form, containing 40% complete protein. The product gets its orange, salmon-like hue through a process that isolates the beta carotene pigment naturally present in spirulina.

International food conglomerate IFF-DuPont’s FoodNxt food-tech innovation lab, based in Israel, is teaming up SimpliiGood and the Israel Innovation Authority to get the product on the market. IFF-DuPont will contribute the faux salmon’s flavor and aroma attributes.

“Our spirulina can act as a complete replacement for animal-based protein or be easily integrated into existing food products as an added-value ingredient, as it has a neutral flavor and maintains its full nutritional value,” said Lior Shalev, CEO and cofounder of AlgaeCore.

“This project marks an exciting milestone in our company’s product line expansion as we enter the fish substitute market,” said Shalev.

The fish sector is the one of the newest to be disrupted by plant-based or cultivated alternatives, in reaction to overfishing and toxins such as mercury, fossil fuels and industrial waste that find their way into fish flesh.

Israeli company Plantish is working toward commercializing a vegan version of whole-cut salmon filet, one of the world’s most popular fish products.

Shalev points out that spirulina is one of the most nutrient-dense plant-based forms of protein on the planet, providing whole protein, antioxidants, chlorophyll, vitamins and minerals (including B12 and iron).

While the relatively young spirulina market is dominated by dried and powdered forms of the ingredient, SimpliiGood cultivates and markets a specific strain of fresh spirulina that boasts 90% nutrient bioavailability.

The spirulina grows in greenhouse-enclosed ponds in Israel’s sunny southern desert region, and 98% of the water used in the process is recycled. Fifty tons of spirulina is produced there each year, with a harvest every 24 hours.

“The spirulina SimpliiGood cultivates is one of the most efficient converters of sun energy into protein,” explained Shalev.",,[],[]

Brightside: Spirulina Experiments,"Brightside: Spirulina Experiments

SALISBURY, Md. – Parkside High School horticulture production management students are learning to grow an ancient plant that just might be one of the ways to solve world hunger. “It creates a buzz, it creates some excitement for the students you know we’re not just sitting around at our desks doing worksheets,” says CTE Horticulture Instructor, Jerry Kelley.

As the population grows, so does the need to feed everyone. Well, a little algae plant could be part of the solution, and high school students are putting the theory to the test. “So what we’re doing here, we’re teaching them about spirulina, how to grow it what works, and the whole scientific process,” says Tom Cropper, a Phycologist with Pelaton Pharms.

Spirulina is a blue-green algae that’s turning into a growing business for agriculturalists. It has three times more protein than beef and chicken, the benefits of a full serving of fruits and vegetables, environmentally safe, river and bay friendly, and even carbon capturing. Cropper tells us, it’s a making huge waves in the farming industry. “As protein gets more expensive, beef, chicken, whatever, this becomes a better option.”

Cropper says he’s working with this algae in hopes of converting hazardous empty chicken houses into spirulina factories. By bringing a typically southern grown crop to the Eastern Shore, he’s getting young minds involved to experiment. “They’re growing their crops all year long and doing the best they can to have the best growth going on for their plans,” says Kelley.

Students at Parkside High school are getting hands-on experience with spirulina, learning to grow it, care for it, and passing their knowledge on to local growers. “My favorite part overall was putting it together, having to figure out what will work best,” says Allison Tribeck, a senior at Parkside High School. She adds, “It can help mostly to prevent world hunger things like that by you being able to get such a small concentrated dose and that can just be your nutrients for the day.”

Part of this ongoing experiment is a partnership with UMES extension, which imagined this program. Melinda Schwarz, a Food and Safety specialist with the University of Maryland Eastern Shore Extension says, the work Parkside was already doing with horticulture was the perfect fit for this idea. “They can see how that applies to what they’re learning here and maybe they can go in that direction and help produce food for the growing population in the world,” says Schwarz.

Instructors and program coordinators say the work they’re doing now is building for the future, and will hopefully launch a broad spectrum of other research they can do next year. “It’s a great place to consider your future in the direction of agriculture and food science and horticulture and food production,” says Schwarz. Kelley adds, “The students get a sense that the community cares about what they’re doing and what they’re learning and that’s a great sense of satisfaction for them.”

Tribeck also tells us, that the experience with this revolutionary algae truly adds to not only her high school experience but taught her a life lesson too. “I came into horticulture and it was something I had to think about and I actually had to try in. It wasn’t just memorizing things or the lesson that I could forget after the test or in the next unit, that is what I like so much about it.” She adds, “Even if you think that it might sound a little crazy or weird, just go for it. It’s a lot of trial and error but if you fail the first time, just try again.”

Students and instructors at Parkside say they’re excited to keep experimenting and hope to learn more from this ancient algae.

Cropper says he’s also developing different recipes with the spirulina, which 47 ABC was invited to try. On a national level, Cropper tells us that scientists are growing the algae to take to Mars eventually, so research for this is crucial.",,[],[]

5 Genius Ways to Stop Sneezing This Allergy Season,"If you're one of the 19.2 million Americans who experience hay fever each year, you know how symptoms like a runny nose and dry, itchy eyes can make for weeks (or even months) of misery. Many people with seasonal allergies point to pollen as their top trigger, and grass pollen levels are about to hit their peak in much of the country. What can you do to prepare for the allergy onslaught, besides hiding indoors and stocking up on ultra-soft tissues and eye drops? Practice the following habits to make this season enjoyable instead of irritating.

1. Nosh Some Shallots

You might shed a few tears when you slice and dice them, but onions could actually help your eyes stay dry during the rest of allergy season. In a study published in the Asian Pacific Journal of Allergy and Immunology, people who ate 3 grams of shallots (about a teaspoon, chopped) and took an oral antihistamine daily had less ocular symptoms (like watery, itchy, red eyes) than people who took the allergy meds alone. The reason? Shallots (and other onions) are rich in quercetin. ""This antioxidant helps stabilize mast cells, which are the part of the immune system that release histamine and trigger allergy symptoms,"" says Robin Foroutan, M.S., RDN, an integrative and functional dietitian based in New York City. Start adding more shallots to your meals with Olive Oil-Poached Carrots & Shallots.

2. Try Spirulina

Allergy sufferers who consumed 2 grams of spirulina per day (about one serving or less of many spirulina powder products) for two months had less nasal runniness and congestion, a better sense of smell and improved quality of life compared to people who took a daily over-the-counter antihistamine, researchers from Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran found. Spirulina eaters rated their sleep, work life and social activity higher than those who took allergy meds instead. That's because this blue-green algae might help your immune system produce less pro-inflammatory proteins while stimulating an anti-inflammatory protein called interleukin-10, the researchers say. Foroutan suggests stirring some spirulina powder into your smoothie or matcha latte. You can't go wrong with this Mermaid Smoothie Bowl. (It's blue, too!)

3. Get Your Vitamin D Levels Checked

Vitamin D deficiency is common. Correcting it could help your allergy medicine work better, according to research published in European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology. Vitamin D-deficient people who took weekly high-dose D supplements and daily antihistamine allergy medicine had more improvement in their allergy symptoms after eight weeks than people who stuck with allergy meds alone. ""Vitamin D helps to balance, support and modulate the immune system,"" says Foroutan. That's helpful, since allergies are essentially an overreaction of the immune system.

It's hard to get all the vitamin D you need from your diet, says Foroutan, but you also don't want to take a higher dose of a supplement than necessary. For a personalized recommendation, ask your doctor to check your blood levels of vitamin D, ideally twice a year, she suggests. You'll find out whether you're falling short on vitamin D, and if you are, your doctor can recommend how much D to add to your diet via supplement.

4. Practice Yoga

Hit the mat to help your nose. Allergy sufferers who practiced yoga three times per week for eight weeks had less nasal congestion, sneezing and runny nose than they did before and compared to a sedentary control group, found a 2022 study. Because yoga is a mind-body exercise that relaxes breathing muscles, it stimulates receptors in your lungs and airways to help you breathe easier. In addition, the common yogic practice of breathing through your nostrils is thought to improve airflow between your nose and sinuses. Plus, yoga has been shown to increase antioxidant activity in the body to bolster your defenses against inflammation.

5. Wear a Mask

People with allergies who masked up during the COVID-19 pandemic reported 16% less sneezing and 14% less nasal runniness than they did pre-pandemic, according to research in the American Journal of Otolaryngology. Plus, the percentage of people with moderate or severe allergy-related nasal or eye symptoms dropped by almost half when they wore face masks; symptoms got milder or disappeared for many. That's likely because surgical and N95 masks keep you from breathing in tree and grass pollen particles, common seasonal allergy triggers.

"4 Health Benefits of Spirulina—Plus, When You Should Avoid It","Spirulina, the blue-green algae you'll likely find in a powdered form that used to only be available in health food stores, is now proliferating supermarkets everywhere. Though it's been used as a food source for hundreds of years in cultures around the globe, it's only now becoming a health item du jour in the states. Here's what you need to know about spirulina, its health benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your diet.

History of Spirulina

Spirulina, or Arthrospira, is an algae that's been used across cultures for centuries. According to WebMD, the Aztecs used spirulina to treat various diseases, and perhaps used it as a supplement for the kingdom's messengers to sustain themselves on their marathon runs. Spirulina is used in much the same way today, and has even made its way to space as a dietary supplement for astronauts on NASA missions.

Now, it appears everyone wants to get their hands on this stuff. According to KBV Research, the global spirulina market is expected to reach $651 million by 2025. Spirulina can bloom and grow naturally in alkaline lakes around the world. However, companies are now also lab-growing this algae, which has an earthy, seaweed-like taste, in massive tubes to ensure there's enough supply for everyone.

Spirulina Nutrition Benefits

Emmie Satrazemis, RD, a board-certified sports nutritionist, registered dietitian, and nutrition director at Trifecta, believes spirulina deserves a spot in many a diet. As she points out, the naturally vegan food is packed with nutrients.

Should People Add More Spirulina to Their Diets?

Schlottman points out that there are countless benefits to adding spirulina to your daily diet. ""Some of the most notable and important benefits include antioxidant protection, improved vision health, increased energy levels, low blood sugar regulation, and immune system strengthening/boosting,"" he explains. ""Spirulina is also a great source of protein for vegetarians and vegans.""

And the list goes on. Spirulina could also play a significant role in staving off malnutrition. According to a 2016 study published in Maternal and Pediatric Nutrition, malnourished children who received spirulina saw significantly more improvement in weight and height gain than children who only received regular supplements.

RELATED: What to Know Before Going Plant-Based, According to an RD



To get all these potential benefits, Satrazemis suggests the easiest route: ""Add a scoop of spirulina to your morning smoothie or in other recipes for a small boost.""

Reasons to Avoid Spirulina

There are some people who should avoid spirulina. According to Schlottman, ""Those with anemia or low blood levels may want to stay away from it because of its high iron content. It can also cause nausea in those without a healthy stomach. People on certain medications might need to avoid spirulina as well, so be sure to talk with your doctor before adding spirulina to your daily diet.""



Per Live Science, those with certain autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis may want to avoid spirulina, as it could worsen symptoms. Spirulina may also weaken the effect of immunosuppressants. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also avoid spirulina, as there is a lack of safety information regarding expectant and nursing moms ingesting it.

When to Buy Spirulina and How to Store It

Spirulina is available in many forms, including capsules and powders. It's also baked into other items such as bars, blended into smoothies, and can even act as a topper to popcorn. Spirulina can be found in grocery stores around the world, throughout the year.

It's best to store spirulina tablets and powder in the refrigerator. Though it doesn't technically go ""bad"", its nutritional qualities will degrade over time. Thus, it's best to consume spirulina within a few months of opening it.

Spirulina Recipes

As you may have guessed, if you're looking to incorporate some spirulina to your diet, you can add the nutritious algae to just about anything. Keep reading for some healthy recipes that could benefit from a dash of spirulina!

This powerful plant boasts high levels of nutrients like protein, vitamins, and iron–in fact, just 1 tablespoon contains 11% of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin B1 (thiamin), 15% of the RDA of vitamin B2 (riboflavin), 21% of the RDA of copper, and 11% of the RDA of iron.

Plus: ""There is incredible research on spirulina,"" Whitten adds, specifically ""on performance, in terms of physical activity and energy levels. Of course, that's not all the blue-green algae can do: See here for all of spirulina's impressive health benefits.*",,[],[]
"Spirulina: Uses, Benefits, Side Effects, Dosage, Precautions","Spirulina is a blue-green algae from the genus Arthrospira (""arthro"" roughly meaning ""joint,"" and ""spira"" meaning ""spiral""). It's been used by the Aztecs in Mexico and people living in the Lake Chad area in Africa for centuries. Spirulina's usually cultivated from bodies of water like lakes or farmed in ponds.

Spirulina contains several nutrients, including fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, and K), fatty acids (DHA, EPA), beta carotene and minerals. It's also a source of protein, but it lacks high enough levels of some of the amino acids that your body needs to function at its best (unless you have a medical condition where you need to avoid specific amino acids, like phenylketonuria or ""PKU""). Since spirulina comes from bacteria (specifically ""cyanobacteria""), it may be considered a protein source for vegans.

It's also important to note that the B12 in spirulina is in a different form as ""pseudovitamin B12"" than the type typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs, especially if you follow a vegetarian or vegan way of eating, which can be low in B12. Lower levels of B12 are also found in adults over the age of 60. And why's B12 important? Because your body needs B12 to make red blood cells, it's also crucial for brain and nerve cell development. Not getting enough B12 can cause tiredness, memory loss, depression, and even different types of anemia.

This article takes a closer look at the potential uses of spirulina and the risks associated with its use.

Dietary supplements are not regulated in the United States, meaning the FDA does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement that has been tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn’t mean that they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about any potential interactions with other supplements or medications.

Uses of Spirulina

Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare provider, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD/RDN), or pharmacist. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease.



Spirulina has fat-soluble vitamins (like A, E, and K), beta carotene and minerals, protein, and phycocyanins (pigments that produce a blue color and have shown antioxidant effects). Phycocyanins have been used as a dye in many industries, including pharmacy, culinary, and even cosmetics.

Scientists have studied, but not necessarily proven, spirulina's impact on different areas of health, including but not limited to:

We'll explore what the science says about spirulina's effectiveness for these health outcomes.



Antioxidant capacity

According to a meta-analysis (a collection of research studies) of nine studies with a total of 415 people, spirulina increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The studies used anywhere from one to eight grams of spirulina per day, a pretty extensive range. Many of the studies had a relatively small number of people, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much. The strength of the effects was not earth-shattering and was generally more substantial when people took five grams of spirulina per day or more.

The conclusion? Getting antioxidants from the foods that we eat can help reduce some of the inflammation in our bodies. To amp up antioxidants in your diet, try including a variety of the most nutrient-dense foods that you can source and afford - and they don't have to be organic - like whole grains, fruit, and vegetables to help increase your body's antioxidant capacity and reduce inflammation in your body. Just don't rely on spirulina alone.

Blood pressure

Scientists did a meta-analysis (a collection of several research studies on a topic) of five randomized controlled trials that included 230 people to check spirulina's effects on blood pressure. The people in the different studies took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina a day. The lengths of the studies were anywhere from two to 12 weeks, and many of the studies were pretty small, meaning they might not be able to tell us very much.

When the data was pooled (put together) and analyzed from these studies, the scientists said that spirulina lowered systolic blood pressure by about 4.59 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure 7.02 millimeters of mercury. Systolic pressure (top number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. Diastolic pressure (bottom number) measures the pressure your arteries experience between each heartbeat. The biggest blood pressure-lowering in the studies was seen in people who had high blood pressure already.

The scientists also said more high-quality studies are needed before we can start recommending that everyone with high blood pressure needs to start eating spirulina.

Blood sugar control

Have you ever gotten a jittery feeling after eating sugary food? That usually means your blood sugar's spiking. And this situation can be dire for people coping with conditions like type I or type II diabetes, disordered eating including diabulimia, and more.

Over time, blood sugar spikes that are left uncontrolled can actually lead to damage to your body. Worst case, in certain conditions like diabetes, that can look like having to surgically remove parts of your body (amputation), heart attacks, kidney failure, or stroke, which can lead to paralysis of parts of your body. While spirulina really would not likely be able to correct severe damage from uncontrolled blood sugar over time by itself, it has lowered blood sugar levels in human studies. And why? It could be its protein and fiber content, or perhaps it is phycocyanin's ability to help with inflammation. Scientists are still figuring it out.

Fourteen studies with 510 people with metabolic syndrome–a collection of symptoms like high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (""good cholesterol""), and high waist circumference, which altogether can create more severe health problems–were included in a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on blood sugar and other outcomes. And a lot of those studies didn't have many people in them, meaning they had lower statistical power. People took anywhere from 1 to 8 grams of spirulina per day. Blood sugar and insulin levels were reduced in some of the studies after taking specific amounts of spirulina. More high-quality studies are needed before healthcare providers can recommend spirulina for lowering blood sugar and insulin levels.

Generally, working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN), particularly a Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist (CDCES), can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. RDs/RDNs can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to avoid spikes in your blood sugar, which could help you feel better. Remember, managing blood sugar can be challenging, and you don't have to do it alone!

Cancer

Unfortunately, very few well-conducted human studies have looked at spirulina's effects on cancer. There've been several studies in test tube cells or in animals that aren't humans. However, more well-constructed studies looking at its effects on humans are needed.



Cholesterol levels

Scientists conducted a meta-analysis of spirulina's effects on cholesterol levels that had seven controlled trials for a total of 522 total people. They found that spirulina reduced: total cholesterol (by 46.76 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)), low-density lipoprotein (LDL by 41.32 milligrams per deciliter), and triglycerides (by 44.23 milligrams per deciliter). It also increased the ""good"" cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL by 6.06 milligrams per deciliter). Again, why did spirulina do this? We're not sure, but scientists think it may be due to its nutritional profile (fiber, fatty acids like DHA and EPA), its antioxidant capacity, or a combination of these.



While healthcare providers cannot recommend spirulina for lowering your cholesterol, they can suggest working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) to help you explore your eating patterns, movement, and more. Registered dietitian nutritionists can help you build your toolkit and your capacity. Again, you're not alone!

Liver health

Spirulina has been studied for its effects on liver health in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the study was very small (only 13 people), so we can't draw any conclusions about spirulina for NAFLD until larger and better studies are done.

Metabolic syndrome

Scientists have studied spirulina's effects on metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome happens when you have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist (excess abdominal fat). Metabolic syndrome can wreak havoc with your health and increases your odds of heart attack, stroke, and type two diabetes. One of metabolic syndrome's main causes is thought to be obesity. Obesity, however, can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass.

One spirulina meta-analysis pulled together data from 18 studies. It suggested that spirulina could help lower high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, which are all parts of metabolic syndrome. It's important to note that while spirulina may impact these outcomes, the most essential issue would be working on your current way of eating, your movement (exercise), and other equally important issues like addressing your emotional health. Spirulina can't solve these serious issues.

Consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and perhaps one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. In addition, they can help you build your toolkit and your capacity to help you feel better. Sometimes it can be challenging to give yourself permission to ask for and accept help. But you've got this. And you don't have to go at it alone.

Obesity

In a meta-analysis of five studies, scientists looked at spirulina's effects on weight management in people coping with obesity. Spirulina did decrease weight in people with obesity by 4.55 pounds and in people who were overweight by 2.82 pounds. However, clinically speaking, this is not enough to make a solid recommendation for use of spirulina for obesity treatment.

As mentioned previously, it's important to note that obesity can also be connected to a host of other social, economic, and environmental causes (determinants of health). Furthermore, its definition is based on a metric that's thought to be flawed (Body Mass Index, or BMI). It's important to note that BMI does not necessarily consider important body composition factors like frame size and muscle mass. And BMI does not give the complete picture of an individual's well-being. Consider requesting a body composition test (for example, skin-fold measurements or a DEXA Body Composition scan) from your healthcare provider in addition to other parameters that they may measure.

As mentioned above, consider working with a team that includes a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) and, ideally, one that's a Board Certified Specialist in Obesity and Weight Management (CSOWM). CSOWM RDs/RDNs can help you explore your eating, movement, medication habits, and more. They can help you build your toolkit and your capacity, and help you feel better. You've got this.



What Are the Side Effects of Spirulina?

An allergic reaction may be possible in those allergic to spirulina. Allergic reactions would include rash or swelling. Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience side effects and call your healthcare provider.



Common Side Effects

Spirulina is generally safe, but some people have reported the following with its use:

Allergy

Headache

Muscle pain

Sweating

Trouble sleeping



Severe Side Effects

While severe side effects from spirulina are rare, be aware that the following have occurred:

Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

(severe allergic reaction) Throat swelling

Immediately stop using spirulina if you begin to experience severe side effects and call your healthcare provider.

Precautions

People with phenylketonuria (inability to process the amino acid phenylalanine) and individuals with other amino acid disorders, for example, classical homocystinuria (HCU), or maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), may need to avoid spirulina due to its high protein and thus amino acid content.



The safety of spirulina in pregnant or nursing people has not been established. Speak with your healthcare provider before using spirulina if you're pregnant, plan to get pregnant or if you're breastfeeding.

Please don't give children supplements–including spirulina–without discussing this with their pediatrician first.

Spirulina can sometimes be contaminated with things like lead or other heavy metals (it grows in lakes, after all) or even toxins.



Dosage: How Much Spirulina Should I Take?

Always speak with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement to ensure that the supplement and dosage are appropriate for your individual needs.



Manufacturer recommendations might vary. As a general guideline though, don't use more than what's listed on your product's label. There's no recommended ""effective"" dosage of spirulina. Avoid spirulina if you're allergic or sensitive to it or any of its ingredients. Studies have used from one to 10 grams a day for up to six months to 19 grams of spirulina a day for up two months, with a relatively good safety profile in people with different conditions.



Again, please do not give supplements to children without first discussing this with their pediatrician.

What Happens If I Take Too Much Spirulina?

An upper limit or recommended intake is lacking for spirulina. Taking upwards of 40 grams per day for an unknown period of time has been noted. If you believe that you've taken too much spirulina, contact your healthcare provider for information.



Interactions

Blood thinners: While there are only about 0.26 micrograms of vitamin K in each gram of spirulina, taking far larger amounts could theoretically impact the blood-thinning effects of some medicines like Jantoven (warfarin).

Immunomodulators: Little evidence exists to support avoiding the use of spirulina with immunosuppressive drugs or drugs that change the way that the immune system works (immunomodulators).

It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included. Please review this supplement label with your healthcare provider to discuss any potential interactions with foods, other supplements, and medications.



How to Store Spirulina

Store spirulina in a cool, dry place. Keep spirulina away from direct sunlight. Discard as indicated by the ""use by"" date on the packaging. Keep away from children and pets.



Similar Supplements

Chlorella (a green algae supplement) is somewhat similar to spirulina.

Frequently Asked Questions Is spirulina the same as chlorella? No, chlorella and spirulina are different species of algae, but they're both supplements.

What antioxidants does spirulina have? Spirulina has phycocyanins.

If I'm a vegan, can I get all my protein and B12 needs from spirulina? While spirulina has most of the amino acids that your body needs, it doesn't have enough of some of them. Try to eat a balanced, varied diet to meet your unique protein needs. The B12 in spirulina–pseudovitamin B12–is in a different form than the type that's typically absorbable by your body. You'll likely need to look elsewhere for your B12 needs.

Sources of Spirulina & What to Look For

Blue-green algae species used in spirulina supplements are typically Spirulina maxima, Spirulina platensis, or Aphanizomenon flos-aquae.



Just because a remedy is thought to be ""natural"" does not mean that it is safe. Some ""wild-crafted"" spirulina products may have been grown in water contaminated with heavy metals (mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium) or other pollutants. Opt for supplements produced in labs and certified by third-party authorities like the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF International.



As with all supplements, it's essential to talk with your healthcare provider before using spirulina to decide if it's right for you.



Spirulina Supplements

Spirulina is often sold as a powder. It's also available in capsule, tablet, and liquid form.",,[],"['Regina C. Windsor', 'Mph', 'Learn About Our', 'Editorial Process']"
I'm a Doctor and Beg You Never Take These Vitamins — Eat This Not That,"Vitamins are a big business! While the billion dollar industry offers consumers a wide range of products promising a variety of things like weight loss, shiny hair, clear skin and overall good health, some vitamins aren't as safe as you think. Yes, there are benefits to taking vitamins, but there's also a lot of risk. ""There are several vitamins that many people take without thinking twice, but that can be quite harmful,"" Dr. Tomi Mitchell, a Board-Certified Family Physician with Holistic Wellness Strategies tells us. Read on to see which ones to stay away from and why–and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had COVID.

1 What To Know Before Taking Vitamins

Dr. Mitchell says, ""There are countless vitamin supplements on the market, and it can be hard to know which ones are worth taking and which ones are not. As a doctor, I often see patients with negative side effects from taking too many supplements or taking the wrong ones. Here are a few things that people should know before taking vitamin supplements. First of all, not all vitamins are created equal. Some vitamins, like vitamin C, are water soluble and will be excreted by the body if you take too much. I like to tell my patients that if they take too much Vitamin C, they might end up with ""expensive urine."" However, other vitamins, like vitamin A, are fat soluble and can build up in your body to toxic levels if you're not careful. It's essential to research each vitamin before you start taking it to know how much is safe for you to take. Secondly, even if you are taking the right vitamins in the right amounts, they may not have the intended effect. This is because many vitamins need to be taken with other nutrients to be properly absorbed by the body. For example, calcium needs magnesium to be absorbed properly. So, if you're only taking calcium supplements, you may not be getting all the benefits that you could be.""

2 Adverse Side Effects Of Taking Vitamins

Dr. Mitchell shares, ""While supplements are often advertised as a quick and easy way to improve your health, they can have quite a few adverse side effects. They can interact with other medications you are taking, which can either make the medications less effective or cause dangerous side effects. Additionally, supplements can cause problems if you have any underlying medical conditions. For example, if you have high blood pressure, taking a caffeine supplement could cause your blood pressure to spike. And if you have kidney disease, taking a supplement that contains iron could lead to further damage to your kidneys. So before you start taking any supplements, it's essential to talk to your doctor to make sure they are safe.""

3 Don't Replace A Healthy Diet With Vitamins

""Though not a direct negative consequence of taking supplements, it is something worth mentioning,"" Dr. Mitchell states. ""It's no secret that a balanced diet is key to maintaining good health. However, even with the best intentions, it can be challenging to get all the nutrients our bodies need from diet alone. This is where supplements can come in handy, providing an extra boost of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. However, it's important to remember that supplements are not meant to be used as a replacement for healthy eating. Taking supplements can lead to poor dietary choices. Some people mistakenly believe that if they take a multivitamin, they can afford to indulge in an unhealthy diet. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. Supplements are intended to supplement a healthy diet, not replace it. So, if you're considering taking supplements, make sure you're also eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. You will only be getting the nutrients your body needs to stay healthy and strong.""

4 Ephedra

Dr. Mitchell explains, ""Ephedra is a plant, also known as ma huang, and is a stimulant that has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine. Its leaves and stems are typically dried and made into teas or powders, which are thought to help with a variety of ailments, including colds, flu, and weight loss. In recent years, ephedra has gained popularity as a dietary supplement, as it is believed to boost energy levels and promote weight loss. However, there is little scientific evidence to support these claims, and the plant has been linked to several serious side effects. Ephedra can cause high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and seizure-like activity, and can interact with other medications, making them less effective. For these reasons, people should think twice before taking ephedra-containing supplements.""

5 Vitamin A

According to Dr. Mitchell, ""Vitamin A is an essential vitamin that the body needs to stay healthy. It can be found in many foods, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, and dark leafy greens. Vitamin A is essential for many things, such as vision, immune function, and skin health. However, too much vitamin A can be toxic. Symptoms of toxicity include liver damage, bone loss, and congenital disabilities. In severe cases, it can lead to coma and death. Therefore, it is essential to talk to a doctor before taking any supplement that contains vitamin A. Too much of a good thing can sometimes be harmful.""

6 St. John's Wort

""Saint John's Wort is a perennial herb with yellow flowers that bloom in the summertime,"" Dr. Mitchell says. ""The plant is native to Europe and Asia but can now be found growing throughout the world. For centuries, Saint John's Wort has been used for its medicinal properties. It has become a popular herbal supplement taken by people hoping to improve their mood or relieve stress in recent years. However, Saint John's Wort can have serious side effects, and people should be cautious before taking it. The herb can interact with other medications, making them less effective. It can also cause photosensitivity, making the skin more sensitive to sunlight. Saint John's Wort can lead to mania or psychosis in rare cases. As a result, it is essential to speak with a healthcare provider before taking Saint John's wort or any other herbal supplement.""

7 Kava Kava

Dr. Mitchell explains, ""Kava Kava is a plant that is native to the Pacific Islands and has been used for centuries by islanders for its medicinal properties. The active ingredient in kava kava is kavalactones, which have sedative, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects. In recent years, kava kava has become popular as a natural treatment for anxiety and stress. However, there are some potential risks associated with taking kava kava. Kava kava can cause liver damage and interact with prescription medications. There have also been reports of people experiencing psychotic symptoms after taking kava kava. As a result, it is essential to speak with a healthcare provider before taking this supplement. People with liver disease or taking medications should avoid kava kava entirely. For others, it may be best to moderate their intake or take it only occasionally. This herb can cause liver damage and should be avoided by people with liver conditions or taking medications that affect the liver.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

8 Spirulina

Dr. Mitchell says, ""Though it might look like something out of a sci-fi movie, spirulina is a type of blue-green algae that humans have consumed for centuries. Recently, however, it has gained popularity as a ""superfood"" due to its high concentration of nutrients. Though spirulina does have some health benefits, there are also some potential risks associated with its consumption. Spirulina is a very efficient adsorbent of heavy metals (mercury and lead) and other toxins. If the algae are grown in water that contains high levels of these contaminants, they will be concentrated in the final product. Additionally, spirulina supplements have been linked to gastrointestinal problems such as nausea and diarrhea. As a result, people should think twice before adding spirulina to their diet. Though it might offer some health benefits, the potential risks may outweigh the rewards.""",,[],"['Emilia Paluszek', 'Heather Newgen', 'Published On June']"
Ways To Grow Spirulina At Home And Why You Should ASAP,"What Is Spirulina?

For centuries, the blue-green microalgae known as Spirulina has been consumed for their health benefits. Today, it’s a popular supplement commonly endorsed as the “miracle from the sea.” Although, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) claims there isn’t enough scientific evidence to determine that Spirulina products are effective. Regardless, the organisms are considered a potent superfood because they contain a high concentration of nutritional contents, including antioxidants, protein, and numerous vitamins and minerals.

Spirulina grows naturally in salty lakes and oceans in subtropical climates. It’s been harvested since Aztec times, from Central Mexico’s Lake Texcoco, and in west-central Africa, from Lake Chad. The people collect the algae and turn it into dry cakes.

At one point, scientists classified Spirulina as a plant because of its photosynthetic ability and richness in plant pigments. However, a new understanding of its physiology, genetics, and biochemical properties gained using modern technology led scientists to place it in the Bacteria kingdom as the Cyanobacteria species, classified in the genus Spirulina. Several species exist, with Spirulina fusiformis, Spirulina maxima, and Spirulina platensis being the most extensively studied due to their high nutritional and potentially therapeutic values.

Spirulina is also being studied to capture carbon. It absorbs carbon like other algae and plants as a part of its photosynthesis, making it a more sustainable option to create protein and other nutrients.

Spirulina is easy to harvest because it grows in microscopic spirals that tend to stick together. It has a relatively mild taste, albeit its bold color. Actually, the blue-green is so vivid that manufacturers use Spirulina merely as a color additive in packaged foods like gum and candy.

Ways To Grow Spirulina Yourself

Algae can absorb toxins from the environment, so the fresh, home-grown version could be the healthiest option. Indoors you can control the conditions and ensure the environment is safe, producing only the most acceptable algae for optimal wellness. Furthermore, fresh, live Spirulina is far more nutritious than its dried counterpart.

The two ways you can go about doing this are: you can make a growing system from scratch, or you can buy one ready-to-go, like British startup Canopi’s Bloom system. Either way, you’ll be able to grow the immune-boosting and cholesterol-lowering superfood in the comforts of your home, toxins-free!

The Bloom System

Bloom consists of two dishwasher-safe and BPA-free polypropylene “pods” docked onto a powered countertop base. Included are nutrient tablets (which also keep the water at the optimum pH for growth) and a live spirulina culture to get you started. All you have to do is place the culture, one of the tablets, and water in one or both of the pods. The base delivers proper light and temperature levels to the Spirulina throughout its growth cycle.

Five days later, the Spirulina is ready for harvesting! The system even has a built-in sensor that detects algae density in the water, which reacts when the density reaches a sufficient level and notifies you via an accompanying app.

Harvesting is just as simple. An integrated air pump pushes the contents in the pod through a fine filter, separating the spirulina concentrate from the water. Each harvest will give you one 5-gram serving, which you can blend into a smoothie, add to foods, or mix into a glass of drinking water.

Home-Made System

Growing Spirulina is easy. You don’t need soil, and it can be grown indoors, so seasonal changes won’t be an issue. Plus, after the simple harvesting process, you can eat it immediately, keep it in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks, or store it in the freezer.

All you’ll need is algae culture, nutrient solution, sunlight, water, a thermometer, and a tank (preferably a transparent one like a typical aquarium).

To make maintenance even easier, you’ll also need the optional air pump, hose, and pH strips. The former will oxygenate the water and stir the contents for you, helping the algae grow faster. The latter will let you know if the waters are at the preferred alkaline conditions for the Spirulina – which is higher than usual. The algae grow best in water, with a pH between 8 and 10.

Lastly, you’ll need a fine cloth to strain the algae from the water when it’s time to harvest.

Make sure you order ‘live’ spirulina cultures.

The nutrient solution can be purchased in pre-mixed bags and should contain sodium bicarbonate, potassium nitrate, magnesium sulfate, Calcium chloride, citric acid, iron sulfate, ammonium sulfate, salt, and urea.

Place the tank next to a window, preferably south-facing, for maximum sunlight exposure.

Fill the tank with non-chlorinated, filtered water. Avoid using tap water because it’s usually not pure enough and contains chlorine.

Keep a digital thermometer handy to ensure the tank conditions are an optimal 95°F (35°C). Spirulina thrives in water at this temperature but dies if it’s too hot or cold or doesn’t grow well.

If you didn’t get the air pump, you’d have to gently stir the water at least twice a week to get oxygen and sunlight to all the Spirulina cells.

If you notice your culture looking thin, use a pH strip to check the alkalinity of the water. The minerals in the nutrient solution should take care of the pH for you, but if the level is off, there are ways to fix it. Add a tiny bit of baking soda into the medium at a time to make the water more basic but not shock the organisms.

You’ll also need to use the pH strips when it’s time for harvesting. When the level has been at 10 for 24 hours, the Spirulina is ready to be consumed. It takes between 3 – 6 weeks to reach this point. When the medium is dark green and thick, the Spirulina should be ready; so, whip out the pH strips and check that water!

To harvest, scoop the Spirulina out onto the fine cloth and press the excess water out. Then, rinse the algae and repeat. The ready-to-eat results will look like dark green mush.

Eating Spirulina

Try to avoid cooking the Spirulina because heat reduces its nutritional value. You can add it to basically anything, sweet or savory because it’s nearly tasteless and odorless. Interestingly, powdered Spirulina can have a strong taste or odor, but fresh Spirulina typically goes unnoticed.

Nutritional Content and Health Benefits

According to the NIH, Spirulina supporters say it can be used to treat various heart, metabolic, and eclectic health issues, including high cholesterol, weight loss, diabetes, Lou Gehrig’s disease, allergies, and premenstrual symptoms.

Others recommend it as an aid for mental and emotional disorders, including stress, depression, anxiety, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. There are even claims that consuming a mixture of Spirulina and zinc can help clear the body of arsenic in those whose drinking water has high levels.

Spirulina contains additional nutrients not found in the average daily vitamin. According to the FDA, it has significant amounts of B vitamins, calcium, copper, essential fatty acids, iron, magnesium, niacin, and potassium. Furthermore, it provides more protein than most vegetables – 60-70% of its dry weight is protein.

In addition, its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are substantial. According to a 2014 study, 3 grams provide more antioxidants and exhibit more anti-inflammatory activity than five servings of fruits and vegetables.

Spirulina can also be used in animal feeds to reduce the effect of animal farming on the climate. CO2 emissions can be used to create spirulina.

Spirulina Studies

A 2016 study involving 87 malnourished and anemic children from Gaza under age 5 found that the children who received Spirulina saw significantly more improvements in height and weight gain, iron and ferritin levels, and hemoglobin volume than those who received standard vitamin and mineral supplements.

Spirulina may help athletes by reducing muscle fatigue. According to a 2010 study, it contains various compounds with antioxidant properties, including beta-carotene, phenolic compounds, phycocyanins, and tocopherols, which aid in the recovery of exercise-induced oxidative stress.

One 2008 study involving 78 adults, ages 60 and 87, tested Spirulina’s lipid-lowering effects. After 16 weeks, the volunteers who took 8 grams of Spirulina supplements daily showed significant reductions in cholesterol.

These are just a few, but many other studies exist. However, many more also still need to be conducted to verify the benefits of Spirulina supplementation.

Is Spirulina Good For Everyone?

Spirulina may not be suitable for everyone. For example, individuals with certain autoimmune conditions, the genetic condition phenylketonuria, and those on immunosuppressants shouldn’t eat/drink Spirulina or take Spirulina supplements. It could worsen symptoms or weaken the effects of immunosuppressants because it enhances the immune system.

In addition, Spirulina could interfere with blood thinners and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory pain medications, so individuals on drugs that do those things shouldn’t consume Spirulina.

Algae (both microalgae and macroalgae) produce several valuable compounds that are drawing the attention of the cosmetic industry. Algal compounds can be used in anti-aging creams, sun protection products, and skin-whitening agents. Microalgae are conventional producers of high-value bioactive products. Various organic beauty products and natural cosmetics are being made available globally. Another new development is the sustainability of the products. When introducing new products, cosmetics manufacturers have increasingly emphasized that they are produced non-harmful to the environment.

The current trend in cosmetics is developing products that meet the consumers' demand by providing multiple benefits with little or no effort.

The skincare industry uses chlorella extract because its compounds contain anti-aging, refreshing, regenerating, emollient, and anti-irritant properties. It has an active role in the cosmetic industry as the pigments/metabolites produced by these organisms enrich the beauty products.

The Impact of COVID-19 on the Algae Products Market for Cosmetics

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely hit many economies around the world. Government measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, such as nationwide lockdowns and quarantines, impacted many industries, including the personal care and cosmetic industry. Social distancing, self-isolation, and nationwide lockdowns have led to the closure of many establishments in many countries.

Story continues

The cosmetic industry is a multibillion-dollar industry that took a financial hit in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail businesses were closed, and in-store shopping, as well as salons and beauty boutiques, were shut down. Working from home, physical distancing, and mandatory wearing of the mask were some of the factors that led to reduced use of cosmetics, thereby impacting the cosmetic industry.

In the algae industry, a major slowdown in algae product sales was witnessed in the first quarter of 2020 due to disruptions in logistics & transportation. The market also witnessed disturbances in the complete value chain, from raw materials supply to production, packaging, and distribution of the final algal products. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this market were felt in China starting in 2020 (China is one of the largest producers and exporters of algae biomass & ingredients for the cosmetic industry in the world). In China, factors such as factory closures, seaweed and other microalgae processing facilities operating at reduced capacities, and restrictions on the import & export of algae biomass strongly impacted the global algae products market for cosmetics in 2020. Moreover, the pandemic also affected this market in many countries, including the U.S., India, Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, the U.K., and Spain. Due to the countrywide lockdown in India, many commercial algae production and processing facilities were shut down or operated at reduced capacities, leading to substantial losses in domestic algae production.

The algae industry in Southeast Asia also faced challenges due to the growing severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the distribution of fresh algae and its biomass within and across markets in the Asia-Pacific region. In Indonesia, the price of exported Cottonii seaweed, used for producing carrageenan (largely used in the cosmetic industry), declined by almost 50% since trade with China, the country's biggest export market.

Therefore, the global algae products market for cosmetics in 2020 and 2021 was affected worldwide by a complete halt in the transportation & logistics industry and scarcity of raw materials. The production of algae had reduced due to lockdowns in many countries.

Key Findings in the Algae Products Market for Cosmetics Study

The global algae products market for cosmetics is segmented by type (carotenoids {beta carotene, astaxanthin, lutein, and other carotenoids}, lipids, hydrocolloids {carrageenan, agar, alginate, and other hydrocolloids}, algal protein, and others), source (seaweed {red seaweed, brown seaweed, and green seaweed}, chlorella, spirulina, dunaliella salina, haematococcus pluvialis, nannochloropsis, and other sources), form (dry and liquid), and geography (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East & Africa). The study also evaluates industry competitors and analyses the market at regional and country levels.

Based on type, in 2022, the carotenoids segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the global algae products market for cosmetics. The large market share of this segment is attributed to the rising acceptance of algal carotenoids such as beta carotene, astaxanthin, and lutein in cosmetic products.

Spirulina Benefits,"In the endurance sport community, spirulina has become a trendy addition to the postworkout smoothie for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Blue green algae, or “spirulina,” was a common item within the health food industry long before it became a “superfood” for its purported health and nutrition benefits.

Here, we’ll dive into to what spirulina is and whether there’s enough evidence to back up the claims behind algae supplements for cyclists.

What are the nutritional benefits of spirulina?

Spirulina is a cyanobacteria derived from blue green algae and then dried to be used in pill or powder form. (Sometimes spirulina is combined with a plant-based protein powder in small amounts).

Spirulina supplements claim to be rich in protein and micronutrients—such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron—and boast antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but you would need to take a lot more than the amount being used in research to reap the nutrient benefits.

For reference, 1 tablespoon (or 7 grams) of spirulina is about the amount used in most studies. This small amount of spirulina contains the following:

20 calories

1.7 g carbs

4 g protein

95 mg potassium

74 mg sodium

8.5 mg calcium

14 mg magnesium

2 mg iron

Perhaps overlooked, spirulina is also high in vitamin K and beta carotene.

As with all supplements Tom Gurney, Ph.D., a sport science researcher at Kingston University in London suggests “checking the ingredient label and whether the supplement is independently batch tested for purity and quality.”

Why is spirulina good for you in general?

The anti-inflammatory properties are primarily associated with phycocyanobilin, the blue-green pigment found in spirulina, which containing antioxidant properties. This rich antioxidant may help decrease inflammation in your body and help with exercise recovery. However, the use of high antioxidant or anti-inflammatory products during the base phase of training use is questionable as it may interfere with training adaptations, according to sports dietitian Namrita Kumar, Ph.D., R.D.N. That’s because, during the base phase of training, the inflammatory response is important for training adaptations to occur. Thus, the use of high antioxidant products may be better utilized during the racing season for rapid recovery purposes.

Can spirulina help with cycling performance specifically?

While initial studies have examined health benefits of spirulina—for instance, reductions in risk for factors for heart disease and improved immunity—more recent work has examined the potential benefits for exercise performance.

A recent study published in the journal Applied Physiology Nutrition and Metabolism examined spirulina supplementation (6 grams per day) for 21 days on various cycling intensities. The study authors found a significantly lower heart rate and blood lactate levels during low intensity cycling sessions after supplementation with spirulina.

“Increases in hemoglobin and improvements in power output were also observed after supplementation with spirulina,” says Gurney, who was the lead author of the study.

While these results seem promising, Gurney cautions it’s important to remember that this area is still very new and in its early stages. However, there may be a potential reason for these observed improvements.

“Although speculative, the high iron content and bioavailability [a measure of how much a substance is able to access your body’s circulation and reach the target area] of spirulina may explain the increases in hemoglobin found in these studies,” he says.

It’s no doubt that hemoglobin—the protein that transports oxygen from the lungs to the muscles during exercise—is important for endurance performance.

“If there are significant changes to hematological markers, such as hemoglobin, supplementation should be advised under supervision by an R.D.N. or physician to ensure safety and avoidance of any interactions or contraindications [situations where a drug or procedure should not be used because it may be harmful to the person],” says Kumar.

Is there an optimal dosage that provides benefits?

The majority of the studies examining athletic performance have used 6 grams of spirulina per day, and studies examining health benefits have ranged from 2 to 8 grams per day. More research is needed to determine the optimal dosage, how long the supplement should be taken, and timing of delivery of spirulina.

“The trend at the moment seems to suggest that a loading period—rather than taking it quickly before exercise—is required before any benefits are seen,” Gurney says. “However, our previous work demonstrated that loading with 6 grams per day of spirulina for one week was beneficial for arm cranking [in the study]—or upper-body exercise [in general]—while the more recent study used a loading protocol of 6 grams per day of spirulina for three weeks.”

The bottom line

Before you buy into the hype, more research is needed to determine how and whether spirulina improves exercise performance in cyclists.

“While it’s tempting to rely on ‘superfoods’ like spirulina for performance benefits, we don’t really have enough information yet to recommend supplementation,” says Kumar.

However, if you are set on giving spirulina a try in your smoothie bowl, be sure to choose a product that is third-party tested.

How spirulina could help make smoothies with a kick,"The blue-green alga spirulina, a popular dietary supplement, could help bioengineers to produce therapeutic proteins such as antibodies1.

Often taken as an antioxidant, spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) is already mass-produced at farms and sold as a powder that can be mixed into smoothies and other beverages. James Roberts at Lumen Bioscience in Seattle, Washington, and his colleagues wondered whether spirulina could replace the yeast and bacteria commonly used to manufacture therapeutic proteins.

The team altered spirulina’s DNA by inserting a gene for an antibody against a component of the bacterium campylobacter (Campylobacter jejuni), a common cause of food poisoning and infant death in low-income countries. Mice that were infected with campylobacter and fed the engineered spirulina were protected from disease. The researchers also fed the spirulina to healthy human volunteers, who showed no negative reactions.

Spirulina could be useful for delivering therapeutics in low-income countries, the researchers say, because it can be dried into an edible powder, does not need to be refrigerated and can be consumed in large amounts. The authors are developing ‘cocktails’ of ten or more therapeutic proteins produced by the microbes.",,[],[]

This Fish-Free Smoked Salmon is Made from Spirulina,"While many people enjoy the taste of smoked salmon, not everyone agrees with the netting of wild fish or the farming of captive fish. However, there’s good news for those people: a novel algae-based smoked salmon replacement is in the works. A collaboration between Israeli startup SimpliiGood and IFF-Dupont is currently developing the product. The substitute, which resembles actual smoked salmon, is made out of “100% pure, fresh, minimally processed spirulina.”

Spirulina is a common cyanobacterium also called blue-green algae. It’s already widely used as a food ingredient and health supplement due to its high nutritional content and claims of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and brain-protective effects. According to SimpliiGood, the salmon substitute is 40% complete protein.

The algae are grown in several ponds in greenhouses located in Israel’s southern desert. About 50 tons (45 tonnes) of spirulina are harvested every year, and 98% of the water needed to cultivate the algae is recycled.

Spirulina is an excellent source of:

Protein

Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)

Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)

Vitamin B3 (Niacin)

Iron

Copper

In addition, spirulina may improve your blood lipid levels, reduce blood pressure, suppress oxidation, and lower blood sugar levels.

Raw spirulina is processed to take on the aroma and flavor of actual smoked salmon using a proprietary procedure developed by IFF-Dupont. Meanwhile, SimpliiGood’s technology gives it a salmon-like color, texture, and mouthfeel, with the hue created by extracting a beta carotene pigment that’s found naturally in algae. However, fresh, live Spirulina is far more nutritious than its dried counterpart.

According to the partners, a final product should be on the market by the last quarter of next year. Then, possibly, other spirulina-based fish alternatives will emerge.",,[],"['Luana Steffen', 'I Am An Artist Who Enjoys Sharing Interesting Information', 'Creative Thinking With The World To Inspire People.']"
A new idea for refining biocrude,"Credit: Bao et al, Frontiers of Chemical Science and Engineering (2022). DOI: 10.1007/s11705-021-2126-y

The high content of nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs) in biocrude obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae is one of the most concerning issues on the applications and environment. The biocrude obtained by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) needs further refining optimization, and the high concentration of nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds such as quinoline, pyridine, etc., will poison the catalyst used in the refining process, so that the deactivation of the catalyst will cause great difficulties in refining the biocrude. Moreover, NOCs and sulfides have a competitive relationship in the desulfurization process of biocrude, which inhibits the desulfurization effect. Although there have been many studies on tackling nitrogen-related problems and analyzing reaction mechanisms for some key reactions, there is still no complete and systematic investigation on the overall nitrogen pathway during HTL process.

Yuanyuan Shao, an associated professor from the School of Chemical Engineering and Technology at Tianjin University, and colleagues proposed to investigate the nitrogen distribution in different products and analyze the effects of reaction conditions on nitrogen distribution to explore its reaction pathway. Their study was published online in Frontiers of Chemical Science and Engineering on March 7, 2022.

""In this project, we used Chlorella sp. and Spirulina sp. as feedstock. The effects of reaction temperature, residence time and solid loading rate on the yield, nitrogen recovery and chemical compositions of biocrude were comprehensively investigated,"" said Prof. Shao. ""We also analyzed the nitrogen distribution in the aqueous phase, and a brief reaction map during the whole process was the highlight of this research.""

""We found that there were three main forms of NOCs, including nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds, amides, and amines. And there was a certain transformation relationship between them; the proportion of distribution in different products mainly depends on the reaction conditions,"" said Tianyi Bao, the first author of the paper, a Ph.D. student from the School of Chemical Engineering and Technology at Tianjin University. ""Even though the chemical compositions of the two microalgae which both belonged to high-protein low-lipid microalgae were similar, the contents and distribution of nitrogen in biocrude and aqueous phase were quite different.""

Actually, the representative of amino acids in Chlorella sp. and Spirulina sp. protein are leucine and arginine, respectively. In terms of chemical structure, leucine is a neutral amino acid while arginine is a basic amino acid. ""We inferred that more nitrogen in basic amino acids was inclined to go into the aqueous phase and existed in the forms of water-soluble NOCs,"" said Tianyi Bao. This result demonstrates that the selection of microalgae, especially the analysis of the internal protein structure, is also one of the focuses of future research.

Anti-inflammatory benefits of spirulina are boosting popularity of the supplement,"Long before it was proclaimed a modern-day superfood, spirulina is said to have been cultivated and consumed by the Aztecs.

Spirulina is a microscopic, cyanobacterium, with a blue-green pigment, whose name originates from its spiral shape. It’s naturally found growing in mineral-rich freshwater lakes or ponds, typically in Mexico, America, Central Africa and Asia.

There are many species, but Spirulina maxima and Spirulina platensis are frequently utilized in commercially available products.

Dried spirulina is available in powders, flakes or capsules with high protein and amino acid content, polyunsaturated fatty acids (gamma-linolenic), bioactives (phycocyanobilin, carotenoids), minerals (calcium, magnesium, selenium, iron, zinc) and B-vitamins.

Its use in food products is growing in popularity mostly in cereal products, snack foods, beverages and as a meat substitute.

Perhaps the most established benefits are improvements in risk factors for cardiovascular disease associated with the antioxidant, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities of spirulina.

A 2020 review also suggested that spirulina helped improve with weight loss, elevated blood lipids and obesity.

Like other blue-green algae, spirulina has the potential for contamination with bacterial toxins and can absorb heavy metals or pesticides. So it’s important to purchase spirulina from a trusted source.

There is no standard dose of spirulina, but 10 grams a day was reported to be safe for up to six months in healthy individuals.

Side effects can include headache, diarrhea and nausea. People with autoimmune diseases should avoid spirulina since it can modulate the immune system. Spirulina contains the amino acid phenylalanine, so people with phenylketonuria should not consume it.

There’s only limited data regarding potential interactions with medications or other dietary supplements, but spirulina might interfere with immune-suppressing drugs or those that slow blood clotting. Consult with your doctor before adding spirulina to your diet.

The secrets of spirulina- The New Indian Express,"By Express News Service

An algae that has its origins in the Moroccan islands and Mexico, spirulina is the wonder food that once sustained the Aztecs and Mesoamericans. Today, it is available in many parts of the world. Surprisingly, it seems to have found a sweet spot in the Indian cuisine as well, says Varsha Pramod, registered dietician and senior research fellow at JBAS College for Women.

""More than 40 dishes in India can be incorporated with the spirulina powder and the taste and texture are still good,"" she says.

Spirulina is a rich source of protein (76 per cent), particularly for a vegetarian-vegan diet. ""If a vegetarian wants to consume a high-protein diet without any supplements, spirulina is a great source. Given that the carbohydrate (6 per cent) and lipid component (2 per cent) is low, it is an excellent choice for weight watchers and health enthusiasts. Also, it has 4-6 per cent of fibre. This again offers weight loss and cardiac benefits,"" she notes.

Spirulina is also a rich source of B complex vitamins and vitamin A, which is usually not found in high quantities in vegetarian food. It has a number of minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium - all of which are very good for bone health - and selenium that is good for many diseases.

""This contains a very high dose of anti-oxidants. It has been found that even just four grams of the powder can give a very high antioxidant capacity. This helps in increasing immunity,"" she elaborates.

Given that you need only small quantities of this algae in your diet, it is quite easy to incorporate. ""In abroad, there is a culture of having spirulina in water as an early morning drink. You can go for the powder, capsule or tablet form. Even with cooking, there is not much of nutrient loss. You can even add it to your meat dishes, especially seafood. It can greatly enhance the taste, texture of the food; its bright green colour also adds to it,"" she says.

Spirulina's high potassium content may make it unsuitable for people with kidney problems or on dialysis. Pregnant and lactating women, those with autoimmune disorders or on immunosuppressants should not consume.

Accumulating Body Flab as You Age? Help Stop It With This,"Accumulating Body Flab as You Age? Help Stop It With This

This article was previously published April 8, 2019, and has been updated with new information.

In 2018, James DiNicolantonio, co-author of my book, “Superfuel,” published a groundbreaking paper,1 “Antioxidant Bilirubin Works in Multiple Ways to Reduce Risk for Obesity and Its Health Complications.”

Bilirubin is a breakdown product of red blood cells (heme) and the chemical responsible for the yellow color of bruises, urine and jaundice.

In that paper, DiNicolantonio explains how bilirubin inhibits NADPH oxidase (typically abbreviated as NOX) — a metabolic enzyme activated in a large number of pathological conditions that generates a great deal of oxidative stress — and how phycocyanobilin found in spirulina can exert similar effects.

The reason for this is because the phycocyanobilin found in spirulina is rapidly reduced to phycocyanorubin, a close homolog of bilirubin, in mammalian cells.2,3 In a follow-up paper4 published March 2019, DiNicolantonio, et.al, propose that elevated bilirubin might aid weight control by preventing the development of leptin resistance, and discuss evidence suggesting spirulina may be an effective way to combat leptin resistance as well.

Bilirubin Can Play a Role in Chronic Disease

When a newborn baby gets jaundice, he is placed under “bili lights” in the hospital nursery to prevent brain damage (kernicterus), should his bilirubin levels become too high. The blue lights break down the bilirubin so it can be excreted. However, at appropriate levels, bilirubin has a strong free radial scavenging effect.

Until recently, scientists were unaware that bilirubin may actually have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and atheroprotective properties, and there is a growing body of scientific and clinical evidence to support this.

From an evolutionary/biological perspective, it also makes sense that nature would have created a way for your body to break down heme,5 which can be toxic if it accumulates. The way bilirubin is thought to provide these health benefits is through its ability to inhibit NOX.

In fact, NOX overactivity appears to play a significant role in a wide range of health conditions, including but not limited to vascular diseases and vascular complications of other diseases (diabetes, kidney failure, blindness and heart disease, for example), insulin resistance, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, cancer, glaucoma, pulmonary fibrosis and erectile dysfunction.

It follows then that preventing many chronic diseases would require finding a means of inhibiting or modulating NOX. Bilirubin is believed to assist with this modulating effect.

People with Gilbert Syndrome comprise 3 to 7% of the population6,7 and illustrate this phenomenon quite nicely, as they are genetically predisposed to chronically elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin.

These individuals, having two to three times as much bilirubin as the rest of us after a 24-hour fast,8 enjoy a greatly reduced risk for coronary artery disease, hypertension, carotid atherosclerosis and overall mortality, and this protection is thought to be related to their high bilirubin levels.9

Spirulina — An Effective NADPH Oxidase Inhibitor

Since phycocyanobilin is a very close relative of bilirubin — and spirulina is a great source of phycocyanobilin — spirulina has enormous clinical potential due to its NOX inhibiting effect. This is why phycocyanobilin has been the focus of a large amount of research.

Phycobilin extracts have been shown to inhibit NOX activity in human aortic endothelium, aortic smooth muscle and renal cell cultures. And bilirubin protects against diabetic nephropathy via downregulation of NOX in rats.

As DiNicolantonio’s 2018 paper10 explains, bilirubin reduces the risk for obesity and related health problems through a number of mechanisms, but primarily by inhibiting NOX complexes.

Downregulating NOX activity — which can be done with spirulina, thanks to its bilirubin-mimicking phycocyanobilin — could therefore have “profound implications for preservation of metabolic and vascular health.” As further explained by the authors:

“Expression of inducible form of heme oxygenase, HO-1, can be boosted by oxidative stress — often derived from NADPH oxidase [NOX] activity; the resultant production of bilirubin feeds back to quell this oxidative stress …

[Phycocyanobilin, which is covalently attached to phycocyanin] is readily converted by biliverdin reductase to the bilirubin analogue phycocyanorubin, which appears to share bilirubin’s ability to inhibit NADPH oxidase [NOX] complexes. Arguably, this may largely explain the versatile antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of oral spirulina … in rodent studies …

A recent cross-sectional epidemiological study evaluating subjects with [Gilbert Syndrome] has discovered that [Gilbert Syndrome] is associated with a reduced tendency to gain body fat in later life … A reasonable deduction is that chronically elevated free unconjugated bilirubin — and perhaps an upregulation in intracellular bilirubin generation — somehow opposes age-related gain in body fat.

Of related interest is a study showing that intraperitoneal administration of bilirubin — administered daily for 14 days — inhibits weight gain in rats fed a diet high in fats and sugar. Bilirubin injections were also found to prevent deterioration of glucose tolerance …

A credible case can be made that the favorable impact of elevated bilirubin on risk for undesirable weight gain reflects preservation of hypothalamic leptin sensitivity …

Activation of NADPH oxidase [NOX] is a key mediator of proinflammatory microglial activation; hence, elevated bilirubin might be expected to support effective leptin function in the arcuate nucleus, thereby aiding appetite control.

Oxidative stress in adipocytes, stemming largely from NADPH oxidase [NOX] activity, appears to play a key role in the induction of insulin resistance and the skewing of adipokine and cytokine production in hypertrophied adipocytes.

Hence, bilirubin and heme oxygenase activity could be expected to aid maintenance of adipocyte insulin sensitivity. Indeed, plasma levels of unconjugated bilirubin have been found to correlate inversely with risk for metabolic syndrome and diabetes in prospective epidemiological studies, as confirmed in a recent meta-analysis.

In both cross-sectional and prospective studies, higher plasma bilirubin levels are associated with better insulin sensitivity and decreased risk for metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes — independent of BMI … A direct protective effect of bilirubin on adipocyte function may be largely responsible for this phenomenon.”

Leptin Resistance: A Hallmark of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes

In order for you to significantly gain weight, you must first become leptin resistant. Leptin is a hormone that helps you regulate your appetite. When your leptin levels rise, it signals your body that you’re full, so you’ll stop eating.

However, as you become increasingly resistant to the effects of leptin, you end up eating more. The question then is: what drives this basic process? Why do you become leptin resistant in the first place?

Research by Dr. Richard Johnson — head of nephrology at the University of Colorado who has published more than 500 medical papers and written a number of books on obesity — clearly shows that refined sugar (in particular fructose) is exceptionally effective at causing leptin resistance in animals and blocks the burning of fat.

Most overweight Americans have some degree of insulin and leptin resistance. This also includes people with diabetes, and many individuals with high blood pressure or high cholesterol. If you fall into this category, it would be prudent for you to restrict fructose to about 15 to 25 grams per day from all sources.

In his most recent paper,11 DiNicolantonio and his co-authors hypothesize that spirulina supplementation may also be an effective treatment for leptin resistance.

Bilirubin Protects Against Weight Gain

As mentioned earlier, people with Gilbert Syndrome are genetically predisposed to chronically elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin. This not only appears to protect them from heart disease and overall mortality, but also prevents body fat accumulation, especially during later years, and hypothalamic leptin resistance is one known condition that promotes weight gain as you grow older.12

Research has shown that leptin injections have no effect on obesity. “Studies in rodents with diet-induced obesity suggest that this phenomenon reflects a loss of leptin responsiveness that is specific to the arcuate nucleus,” DiNicolantonio notes.13

Research also suggests that diet-induced obesity is related to the activation of microglia (glial cells that function as scavengers) in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH).14 Again, NOX plays an important role. Activation of microglia also leads to the production of toxic oxidants such as peroxynitrite and other proinflammatory cytokines.

As noted by DiNicolantonio, “Hence, it is straightforward to propose that bilirubin may have the ability to downregulate microglial activation by diminishing NADPH oxidase activation.” That said, bilirubin does not appear to be able to influence leptin activity until or unless leptin resistance has actually developed.

Spirulina May Combat Leptin Resistance by Mimicking Bilirubin

Now, while raising your bilirubin level could potentially protect you from obesity and diabetes, it’s not a useful nutraceutical in and of itself, and this is where spirulina comes in, as the phycocyanobilin found in spirulina is very similar to bilirubin. DiNicolantonio sums it up as follows:15

“If the hypothesis presented here is correct, the far lower body fat in older subjects with Gilbert Syndrome reflects the ability of bilirubin to suppress the activation and proliferation of microglia in the MBH.

The extent to which this expansion of activated microglia — and the associated impact on the function of leptin-responsive neurons — can be reversed by elevation of bilirubin (or administration of phycocyanobilin) in patients who have already developed obesity with leptin resistance remains to be seen.

Particularly because microglial mass increases, it may be rash to assume that this syndrome is fully reversible. If phycocyanobilin does prove to have utility for controlling hypothalamic inflammation, its greatest impact on obesity will likely be achieved by long-term administration in a preventive mode.

In any case, studies evaluating the impact of bilirubin or phycocyanobilin administration on the development of hypothalamic leptin resistance in fat-fed rodents appear to be warranted … Two studies have been published very recently in which inclusion of spirulina in the diet has been shown to inhibit gain in body weight and fat in rats fed a high-fat diet; these appear to be the first studies to have evaluated spirulina’s impact in this regard.

Although neither of these studies focused on leptin function, the fact that markers of adipose tissue browning were higher in rats receiving spirulina is consistent with effective leptin function in these rats.

Moreover, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial has also emerged, in which spirulina supplementation (at only 2 grams daily) was found to potentiate loss of body fat, body weight, waist circumference and BMI in overweight subjects placed on a calorie-restricted diet; reductions in triglycerides and C reactive protein were also greater in the spirulina group.

Bilirubin mimesis [imitation or mimicry] may represent one example of a more general strategy for preventing or reversing inappropriate weight gain: counteracting hypothalamic leptin resistance or upregulating hypothalamic leptin signaling.”

Spirulina Types, Dosing and Potential Adverse Reactions

There are many types of spirulina on the market, so do your homework before making a purchase. Since spirulina grown in an uncontrolled environment has the potential to become contaminated with heavy metals and other toxins, it is important to choose organic spirulina from a reputable source.

Spirulina comes in capsules, tablets, powders and flakes. Dosing depends on what you plan to use it for and to whom it is given. A general starting dose for adults is typically around 3 grams. For disease prevention, you may work your way up to 20 grams per day. The adult maintenance dose is typically around 10 grams a day.

Remember to increase your intake of spring water or filtered water when taking spirulina to help it absorb into your system. Also be aware that spirulina is a potent detoxifier, so depending on your toxic burden, you may or may not experience a detox reaction. For that reason, it is best to start with a small dose and work your way up.

Though there are no known side effects associated with spirulina, your body may react to it based on your current state of health. Some of the most prominent reactions you may experience include:

Slight fever — The high protein content in spirulina increases metabolism, which may elevate body temperature Dark green stool — Spirulina can remove accumulated waste products in your colon, which may cause darker stool. Also, spirulina is high in chlorophyll, which turns your stool green Gas — Buildup of gas may indicate that your digestive system is not functioning properly Excitability — Your body is converting protein into heat energy, which may cause temporary feelings of restlessness Breakouts and/or itchy skin — This is caused by the colon cleansing process and is a temporary reaction Sleepiness — This is caused by the detoxification process and may indicate your body is exhausted and needs more rest

Also keep in mind that while spirulina is entirely natural and generally considered a healthy food, there are some important contraindications you need to be aware of. Avoid spirulina if you are:16

Severely allergic to seafood

Allergic to iodine

Pregnant

Nursing

If you have hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), consult your health care provider before taking spirulina. Also avoid taking spirulina if you are currently running a fever, as it may raise it further. Also, do not take spirulina if you have an autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, or if you a metabolic condition called phenylketonuria (PKU).

Chlorella — An Alternative if You Can’t Tolerate Spirulina

Chlorella is another form of algae that is sometimes confused with spirulina. The fundamental difference between spirulina and chlorella is that spirulina does not possess the hard cell wall that makes chlorella closer to a plant than algae. Note, however, that chlorella does not have the phycocyanobilin so it will not inhibit NOX and increase NADPH.

Chlorella is an excellent way to detoxify your body from mercury, a common problem if you have amalgam dental fillings, have received a thimerosal-containing vaccine or regularly eat contaminated fish. It is also one of nature’s highest source of chlorophyll, which has many biological benefits.

Spirulina is unable to remove heavy metals, as it lacks a cell membrane. It can, however, protect your liver against the toxic effects of heavy metals, and help eliminate other toxins, including arsenic. If for whatever reason you cannot tolerate spirulina, chlorella could be a viable alternative to obtain some of its benefits described above.

Many spirulina supplements come in capsule or tablet form, while others come in powder form. The form doesn’t influence the product’s effectiveness so that you can make any choice according to your preference.

Quantities and amounts

Always be mindful of the number of capsules or tablets per serving, as well as per container. This step also applies to products in powder form. All those features affect the overall product value.

Value for your money

At times, the price can be an indication of quality or, in the case of supplements, potency; if it is very low compared to other brands, the dosages may not be enough or include unproven components. On the other hand, if it is too expensive, it should have the correct amounts of essential ingredients.

GMO-free

An essential factor, the supplement must not contain any genetically modified organism.

Presence of metallic compounds and allergens

Spirulina is naturally grown or cultivated. As such, there should be no heavy metals present. Although some have substantial iron amounts incorporated in the supplement, this is not dangerous as iron is even introduced into baby formulations during infancy.

Another vital indication is the absence of allergens like gluten, egg, lactose, soy, corn, and others.

FDA/cGMP certifications and approvals

It is crucial to discern that a product contains safe and high-quality ingredients. One perfect way to find out is by checking if the products are made in cGMP/FDA approved or certified facilities and processes. There are other third-party certifications and seals for other essential matters about ingredients and components. Some of these are the Halal and Kosher certifications, the Ecocert, USDA, EU Organic, Naturland, and others.

In instances when you don’t have acquaintances that have tried the product before, you can check out websites like iherb.com or Amazon, as well as other online sites associated with health and wellness campaigns.

Who Should Purchase Spirulina supplements?

Individuals with allergies

Research and studies have shown that spirulina could moderate immune function, advancing the allergic rhinitis symptoms via an unknown technique.

Individuals with cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes

Clinical experiments have identified cholesterol- and glucose-lowering effects of spirulina.

People in a state of malnutrition

Because it is densely packed with essential nutrients, spirulina is a high-value nutritional supplement. That is especially important in individuals who are HIV-positive and are malnourished at the same time.

People who are exposed to high arsenic content in drinking water

A critical study has indicated that spirulina could be used to treat individuals with protracted arsenic poisoning caused by contaminated drinking water.

Individuals who have weak immune systems

Spirulina holds immunity-enhancing effects, which can be useful in fighting cancers and viral infections. Moreover, spirulina may have direct antiviral activity.

There is no conclusive evidence that currently indicates the use of spirulina as individual therapy, or to replace conventional treatment for each of the indications mentioned earlier. We recommend consulting your doctor before altering your treatment program.

How Do I Choose a Good Spirulina Supplement?

Effective spirulina supplements should be manufactured by respectable companies that rigorously abide by good manufacturing practices (GMP). They must be essentially free of microcystins and heavy metal contamination.

Furthermore, they should not contain any GMO or genetically modified organisms and should be free of allergens such as gluten, egg, lactose, soy, corn, etc.

The mode or form of dosage is also of import in selecting the best spirulina supplement for your needs. Most come either in pill/tablet/capsule or pure powder form. Whichever type you choose does not affect the potency or effectivity of the product in any way.

Price is also an indication of potency and effectiveness. Most of the spirulina brands have comparable price ranges, thus giving you a guide at a reasonable cost. Anything grossly too low or too expensive is suspect and should be considered with care before purchasing.

Other pluses would be certifications or seals of approval by reputable organizations within the health and wellness communities, quality circles, and standardization institutions. Examples of such are Halal, Kosher, Eurocert, USDA, among others.

Lastly, it wouldn’t hurt to check out the feedback from other users. You may have acquaintances that are familiar with some of the brands. Otherwise, hundreds of reviews, health and wellness websites and online shopping sites (like Amazon, iHerb, etc.) feature lots of user feedback. Most of these are excellent sources of information, not just for prospective buyers, but also for the manufacturers themselves as an alternative feedback system.

With all that in mind, you can now start your deliberation in choosing the best option that will suit your needs and preferences. For additional information to help you in your selection, please continue reading on the following sections on spirulina’s benefits, possible side effects, dosage recommendation, frequently-asked questions, and our final summary with suggestions.

What Are Spirulina’s Benefits?

Spirulina, cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, is popularly referred to as a “superfood.” It has become the theme of about a thousand highly acclaimed scientific papers, and a vast number of research findings. Some principal spirulina applications include:

Nutrient-filled

Spirulina is a microorganism that is highly rich in nutrients. One tablespoon of pure spirulina powder contains typically 4 grams of protein, vast amounts of copper, magnesium, iron, vitamin B complex, and more. Spirulina is considered by many as the best nutritious food on earth gram-for-gram. Due to this, spirulina is mixed with several energy bars, health supplements, and superfood blends. In other words, spirulina functions as the best source of amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and various nutrients essential to the normal function of our bodies.

Anti-inflammatory & antioxidant

Spirulina is known to have powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The foremost active complex in it is phycocyanin. Interestingly the very compound provides spirulina its distinctive hue. Phycocyanin has powerful anti-inflammatory properties, and also defends from oxidative damage triggered by radical elements. Oxidation-related stress can amplify the danger of several health issues, such as cancer, causing several experts to consider that antioxidants similar to those present in spirulina can aid in reducing the danger of cancer acquisition.

Cholesterol

Spirulina, in many instances, is believed to possess a beneficial influence on cholesterol quantities, theoretically reducing triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. It is also useful in increasing (HDL) “good” cholesterol levels while decreasing “bad” cholesterol. So, spirulina can aid in lowering a number of threat aspects for heart diseases and various severe health issues.

Cancer

Spirulina was able to reveal some potential in averting the growth of cancer, mostly oral cancers. One research in India monitored a group of 87 people having pre-cancerous lesions inside their mouths. One year after continuous spirulina administration, 45% of the participants indicated full degeneration of cancerous-like lesions, as opposed to only 7% in the control population. Spirulina has presented substantial potential in dealing with oral cancers, although some scientists think it could have the capacity for a wide variety of cancers. Further research is necessary.

Blood pressure

Certain pieces of evidence indicate that spirulina can aid in lowering blood pressure. That effect is due to spirulina’s influence on the production of nitric oxide, which assists blood vessels, causing them to relax and dilate. Additional research is required.

Exercise

Spirulina can aid in boosting exercise endurance and performance. Oxidative harmful effects towards the muscles are brought about by exercise, thereby contributing to muscle weakness. The antioxidant activity of spirulina is believed to negate particular oxidative damage, enabling athletes to function longer without getting exhausted.

Blood sugar

Many animal studies show spirulina being a promising instrument in managing glucose levels in blood and diabetes indications. Spirulina mostly beat prescription medications for diabetes in some instances. Clinical confirmations in the human trial are incomplete, but a minor study discovered a substantial drop of blood sugar amounts in patients with diabetes (type-2). Further research is required.

Generally, spirulina is exceptionally nutritious and possesses a plethora of latent health advantages. It is a scarce food that is deserving of being called “superfood.” The amount of nutrient contained is sufficient to contemplate spirulina consumption, not to mention its potential for considerable health benefits.

Side Effects of Spirulina

In 2011, the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), through its Dietary Supplements Information Expert Committee (DSI-EC), appointed spirulina a ‘class A’ safety rating, signifying that the existing scientific evidence does not pose a severe health risk.

On its own, spirulina is mostly safe to consume and has no side effects. However, problems can occur if the spirulina gets contaminated with heavy metals and other toxic pollutants. Arsenic, mercury, or lead poisoning could come from inadvertently consuming contaminated spirulina. One other potential spirulina contaminant is microcystin, a toxin that can damage livers.

Most of the spirulina supplements suggest the avoidance of intake for pregnant women and nursing mothers. Also important is keeping the product away from children and minors. Of course, the best recommendation is to consult your doctor before consuming any of the supplement brands.

Recommended dosage

Spirulina supplements usually come in either dried powder form or capsules/tablets. Capsules are more expedient to take, but the powder can be mixed into bread, salads, smoothies, or used as seasonings in various foods. The option of form and method of consumption depends on personal choice, and whatever is utilized would yield the same results.

The typical spirulina dosage is from 2.8 to 3.0 grams per day. That’s about 5-6 tablets (500mg) or a teaspoon of powder a day. Of course, that is subject to the recommendation of a health specialist or a physician.

FAQs

What is Spirulina?

Spirulina is the popular name for two microorganism species: Arthrospira maxima and Arthrospira platensis. While it is often referred to as blue-green algae, the spirulina being used in several dietary supplements theoretically belongs to the group Cyanobacteria, a type of non-infectious bacteria that is named after its bluish hue.

Which spirulina species is used frequently?

Of the two spirulina species, the most commonly used in nutritional supplements is the spirulina platensis.

Where is spirulina found?

Spirulina is usually seen naturally propagating in tropical regions and by the lakes as biomass or microorganism. It is usually cultivated and utilized as a whole food by itself, or processed into powder as dietary supplements. The Aztecs were the first to utilize it as a customary food source.

Why is spirulina called a “superfood?”

Spirulina contains substantial amounts of essential amino acids, vital fatty acids, glycolipids, minerals, polysaccharides, proteins, and vitamins. Protein takes up nearly 70% of spirulina’s dry weight, which is about thrice as much as beef protein! Spirulina provides about 290 calories/100 grams of the “superfood” that it has been considered a strategic player in the discussion to focus on food scarcity and security concerns.

What nutrients does spirulina have?

The most excellent spirulina supplements provide amino acids, iron (including other minerals), protein, vitamins, and beneficial lipids such as gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Some spirulina supplements are also reinforced with additional minerals and nutrients, augmenting the benefits of full dried spirulina or its extract.

Does spirulina have special uses?

Also, because of its exceptionally high nutritional value and straightforwardness of cultivation, NASA scientists have suggested that spirulina be grown and utilized as a food source by astronauts while on missions in space!

Recap

We have shown you the benefits of the spirulina “superfood” and its subsequent supplement derivatives. Due to the organism’s almost extraordinary nutritional value, hundreds of supplements are available in the market. And choosing the best option for your specific needs and requirements can be a challenge.

We hope that providing you with the proper guide indicating the features and particulars to be considered has helped you in searching for the optimal brand.

As a summary, we reiterate the need to check if the supplement brand you are considering has the necessary features, ingredients, certifications (USDA, non-GMO certs, Halal, Kosher, etc.). It must be manufactured in GMP-certified facilities and processes; it should be allergen-free (Gluten-free), and must not contain any heavy metals or contaminants. You should also verify its potency concerning the product’s value for your money.

Finally, we emphasize the importance of consulting with your doctor prior to consuming the available supplements, especially if you are pre-diagnosed with a medical condition.

Good luck, and we hope you thoroughly enjoy the benefits of your choice of the best spirulina supplement!",,[],"['Ash', 'Ace', 'Ash Is A Certified Personal Trainer Through The American Council On Exercise', 'Ace . She Holds B.A. In Biology Rutgers', 'M.S. In Exercise Science', 'Kinesiology']"
The best vegan sources of protein to include in your diet,"If you’ve just decided to go vegan, you’re probably wondering where to find the best vegan sources of protein. No wonder – for most people, switching to a plant-based lifestyle means completely overhauling their dietary habits. Without meat, dairy and eggs, many people may struggle to structure their diet in a way that helps them to meet their protein requirements.

So do you need to eat meat to get protein? In short, no – but it does require more planning and preparation. This is because protein is present in many different plants, but the quality may not always be comparable to that found in animal-based foods. Meat, dairy and eggs contain enough of all the essential amino acids – the building blocks of protein molecules that we are unable to produce ourselves. Most vegan sources of protein tend to lack one or more of these important components.

Of course, investing in the best vegan protein powder is one way to ensure you’re getting a full amino acid profile. Another option is to include more complete, or almost complete, plant-based protein sources in your diet. Here are eight of the best vegan sources of protein to help you meet your requirements while enjoying a plant-based lifestyle.

Also, check our 7-day plant-based diet meal plan for more ideas how to cook without animal-based foods!

1. Tofu and tempeh

Soy and soy-based products, such as tofu and tempeh, are one of the most common staples in plant-based kitchens around the world. Not only do they work well with a variety of dishes, they’re easy to prepare and a rich source of complete protein. What’s more, soybean products contain many important nutrients.

According to a review published in Nutrients (opens in new tab), tofu and tempeh are excellent sources of calcium , manganese and selenium , as well as highly bioactive compounds called isoflavones. Isoflavones are polyphenols that may mimic the effects of female reproductive hormones. Despite concerns that these compounds may negatively affect men’s health, available evidence (opens in new tab) suggests this is not the case. In fact, quite the opposite – multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that a high intake of soy and soy products may lead to a vastly reduced risk of dying from breast, gastric, colorectal, prostate and lung cancers, as well as cardiovascular diseases. Many of these effects have been attributed to isoflavones.

According to a review published in Molecules (opens in new tab), these polyphenols also have the potential to reduce blood pressure, regulate blood sugar levels, lower cholesterol levels and combat inflammation.

Add tofu and tempeh to salads, stir fries and one pot dishes. Also, use instead of meat alternatives, beans, peas and lentils.

Protein:

3 oz (85g) serving of tofu contains 8g of protein

3 oz serving (85g) of tempeh contains 11g of protein

2. Seitan

Seitan is a plant-based meat substitute made out of wheat gluten and as such, it’s often referred to as ‘wheat meat’ or ‘wheat gluten’.

Unlike similar soy-based products, it closely resembles the look and texture of cooked animal flesh. Apart from its distinctive chicken-like flavor, seitan is famous for its exceptionally high protein content.

However, despite being one of the richest vegan sources of protein available on the market, it’s worth mentioning that seitan is relatively low in the essential amino acid lysine, unless the wheat used for its production was fortified with this ingredient.

When it comes to nutritional value, seitan is low in fats and carbohydrates, and fairly high in selenium, iron , calcium, and phosphorus . It’s a great addition to any plant-based diet, but owing to its high gluten content, seitan can't be eaten by individuals suffering from celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.

Seitan is a great alternative to cooked meat. It can be pan-fried, sautéed or grilled, and added to soups, salads and stews.

Protein:

3 oz (85g) of seitan contains 64g of protein

3. Quinoa

Quinoa (pronounced keen-waa) is a highly versatile and easy to prepare pseudo grain from South America, and has a mild, nutty flavor that easily complements many dishes. This grain is particularly valued by people suffering from celiac disease as it doesn’t contain gluten.

Whilst a cup of cooked quinoa provides less than 10g of protein (slightly lower than other plant-based proteins) it is a popular food staple among vegans and vegetarians because it boasts a complete amino acid profile. It also has a particularly high lysine content.

But that’s not the only health benefit associated with this plant. According to a review published in the Molecules (opens in new tab) journal, quinoa is a rich source of biologically active compounds that have strong antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. What’s more, multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that regular consumption of quinoa provides protection against multiple different cardiovascular, metabolic, and degenerative diseases. It may also have a beneficial effect on the functioning of the immune system and menopause symptoms.

Quinoa works well for quick, one pan recipes or as an alternative to rice, pasta or porridge.

Protein:

One cup of cooked quinoa contains approximately 8g of protein

4. Buckwheat

Buckwheat is another gluten-free pseudo-cereal that provides good quality protein. Similar to quinoa, it contains a significant amount of the essential amino acid lysine. It’s also a great source of phosphorus, manganese, copper, magnesium and iron, as well as containing a wide array of biologically active compounds like flavonoids and beta-glucans.

What’s more, multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that regular consumption of buckwheat grain can help to regulate cholesterol levels, combat systemic inflammation and lower blood pressure, as well as reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease and several different types of cancer.

The most common way to eat buckwheat is in the form of soba noodles. These grains can also be cooked similarly to oatmeal, or ground into a flour and used in baking, particularly for pancakes and other breakfast dishes.

Protein:

One cup (168g) of cooked buckwheat oats provides approximately 6g of protein

5. Chia seeds

Chia seeds first rose to prominence as a unique cooking aid. The dietary fibers in chia seeds are able to rapidly soak up water and create a jelly-like texture, making them a great ingredient in baked goods, puddings and desserts.

First and foremost, however, they’re an excellent vegan source of protein, providing a significant amount of all essential amino acids. Chia seeds also contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary fibers, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus and potassium.

Owing to their great nutritional value, chia seeds may be highly beneficial for our health. According to a review published in Molecules (opens in new tab), regular consumption of chia seeds can reduce the risk of developing neurodegenerative and liver diseases, as well as hypertension, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular problems. Multiple studies have also shown that they can help with losing weight, reducing waist circumference and improving endurance in long-distance runners.

Chia seeds can be used to make puddings, desserts and pectin-free jams. They’re also commonly used as an egg substitute in vegan baking, and work well as a topping for oatmeal, salads or smoothies.

Protein:

Two tablespoons (28g) of chia seeds provide 4g of protein

6. Hemp seeds

Hemp seeds are the small, edible fruits of the Cannabis sativa plant. If that raises your eyebrows, don’t worry – hemp seeds only contain traces of THC , the psychoactive ingredient that this recreational drug is known for. According to a review published in Nutrients (opens in new tab), the amount of THC in hemp-based foods is below the threshold of 0.3%, making it suitable for consumption.

There are definitely benefits to including more hemp seeds in your diet. These little pips not only have a pleasant, nutty taste and work well with a range of different dishes, they’re also very nutritious. Hemp seeds provide a whooping 32g of protein per 100g. They’re also rich in antioxidants and polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid (omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid ( omega-3 ), as well as iron, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and zinc. According to a review published in the Cancers (opens in new tab) journal, due to their strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, cannabinoids in hemp seeds can suppress and prevent tumor cells from developing and spreading further in the body.

Hemp seeds can be sprinkled over yogurts or salads, added to smoothies, or included in homemade granola and energy bars.

Protein:

Three tablespoons (30g) of raw, hulled hemp seeds contain 10g of protein

7. Spirulina algae

The last few years have seen a steep rise in studies exploring the nutritional value and health benefits associated with marine algae. According to a review published in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture (opens in new tab), spirulina is one of the richest complete protein sources of microbial origin, almost on par with meat and soybeans. It also delivers a significant amount of B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, copper and iron, as well as multiple bioactive compounds, including phenolics, phycocyanins, and polysaccharides.

Multiple studies (opens in new tab) have shown that spirulina algae exhibits strong antioxidant, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, and may play an active role in preventing heart disease, hypertension, degenerative conditions, exercise-induced muscle damage and infectious diseases.

There’s even some emerging evidence (opens in new tab) that these algae can reduce mental fatigue, protect the brain vessels from damage and contribute to cognitive function.

Spirulina is mostly sold in the form of a powder with a characteristic green hue. This can be added to smoothies, granola bars, soups and salads. It can also be purchased as tablets.

Protein:

1 tablespoon (7 g) of dried spirulina provides 4g of protein

8. Beans, peas and lentils

Pulses (beans, peas and lentils) are not considered complete protein sources as they tend to contain fairly small amounts of two important essential amino acids – methionine and cysteine. However, since pulses are otherwise rich protein sources and deliver the bulk of this macronutrient in most plant-based diets, they deserve a mention.

According to a review published in the Journal of Medicinal Food (opens in new tab), pulses provide a hefty dose of dietary fiber , iron, zinc, folate, calcium and magnesium, as well as a wide range of phytochemicals with strong antioxidant and antimutagenic properties. Due to their low glycemic index, they may also help you to lose weight and keep your blood sugar under control.

Beans and lentils play an important role in regulating blood pressure, blood lipid profile and blood glucose metabolism, as well as reducing systemic inflammation and protecting against cardiovascular diseases. Although, some sensitive individuals may find pulses hard to digest.

Cooked pulses work great with most salads, soups and plant-based main meals, particularly stews and curries.

Protein:

A cup (200g) of boiled pulses provides anywhere from 15g (kidney beans, lentils and black beans) up to 39g (edamame beans and chickpeas) of protein",,[],['Anna Gora']
"Meet Bloom, a Machine That Aims to Make Growing Spirulina at Home as Easy as Brewing Coffee","Spirulina is a blue-green algae considered a “superfood” due to its nutrient density, and it contains iron, B vitamins, and Vitamin E. A start-up called Canopi launched an Indiegogo campaign for its countertop machine named Bloom, which enables people to cultivate spirulina in their own kitchens.

Canopi aims to make growing spirulina with its system is just as easy as brewing coffee. Once the user adds water, a nutrient tablet, and living spirulina culture to the Bloom’s two growing pods, the machine optimizes light, heat, and airflow to create a perfect environment for spirulina to bloom.

With Bloom’s mobile app, users can track the growth of the spirulina, and be notifed once it is ready to harvest. After day five, users can simply press a button on the machine to turn the liquid spirulina into a paste. This paste can then be used in smoothies, soups, dressings, sauces, water, or even frozen into cubes for later.

The double pods provide a total of 10 grams of spriulina every five days (the recommended serving size is 5 grams), which equates to 14 servings per month. The Early Bird pre-order price for Bloom is £174 GBP (~$237 USD), and it comes with three months worth of nutrients.

Bloom: Home-Grown Superfood, The Smart Way

Watch this video on YouTube

In 2018, we covered a company called Spirugrow that had launched a campaign on Kickstarter for its at-home spirulina growing machine. This machine was bulky and costs €471 ($549 USD). Spirugrow, as The Spoon predicted, failed. Rob Russell, one of the creators of Bloom, said that the company learned from Spirugrow’s mistakes, and used this to inform its own machine design. Bloom is cheaper, smaller, and appears to be more streamlined compared to Spirugrow.

Of course that’s if and when they deliver the product. While Canopi has finished the Bloom design, they still need to go through testing and ramp up manufacturing. As readers of The Spoon know, manufacturing is usually the most challenging phase for young hardware startups.

Finally, although Bloom seems like an overall better design and concept compared to Spirugrow, it still begs the question: is there enough demand for homegrown spirulina? According to its Indiegogo campaign, there might be. Bloom has raised $116,987 USD of its $20,462 target, exceeding its goal by 571 percent. There are four days left in the campaign, and preorders for Bloom are still available.

"Lumen Bioscience: Spirulina-based platform enables rapid, low-cost development of oral biologics","Researchers at Lumen Bioscience report in Nature Biotechnology​ genetic engineering methods to highly express bioactive proteins in spirulina using what they say are large-scale cultivation and processing methods appropriate for biopharmaceutical manufacturing.

The company describes it as a rapid, low-cost drug development approach to orally delivering biologics.

Previous attempts to convert Spirulina, a photosynthetic cyanobacterium​, into a biomanufacturing platform have proven futile, said the Lumen team.

The paper ​​also summarizes preclinical and early-stage clinical testing of Lumen’s orally delivered spirulina-expressed antibody targeting campylobacter.

Beyond campylobacter, the spirulina-based technology offers promising treatment options for conditions such as C. difficile​, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain metabolic diseases, said Lumen CEO and cofounder, Brian Finrow.

The challenge​

It took outside intervention, however, for the company to realize the benefits of focusing its spirulina platform on such targets, he told us.

It was a prompt from the Gates Foundation, which is located just across the lake from Lumen’s facility in Seattle, that initiated the company’s current R&D programs and strategy: “The Gates Foundation team approached us ten weeks after we incorporated and introduced us to this idea of directly delivering monoclonal antibodies and other protein therapeutics to diseased tissue and particularly to the GI tract.” ​

The non-profit organization maintained that delivering antibody drugs orally to prevent and treat highly prevalent gastrointestinal diseases rather than by injection would make them safer. However, orally delivered antibodies require repeat dosing, and antibodies made with traditional technologies such as CHO cell fermentation, which typically cost $100-$200 per gram, are too expensive to manufacture in the quantities necessary for oral delivery.

Looking at injectables, very little of the antibody, when delivered that way, actually goes to the site of the disease, in the mucosal epithelium, said Finrow. “You have to overwhelm the system with a huge dose,”​ he added.

“The Gates Foundation educated us that if you come from the top down, as we do, by eating the antibody, you can achieve much higher concentrations at the site of the disease and, therefore, get a much better effect. And you sidestep the systemic exposure you get with injected antibodies. In other words, not only can you make a more effective drug for ​highly prevalent diseases​, such as ​C. difficile​ infection,​ but it is also a safer drug.”​

The challenge though is manufacturing huge quantities of antibodies – metric tons - for oral delivery at a miniscule cost. “You are never going to get there with sterile fermentation.”​

So how does spirulina come into play?

""Well, it is the only microbe that is farmed at commercial scale for human consumption. Most importantly, it grows under unusual conditions, very high temperature, very high salinity, and very high pH. It is very nutritious, that facet is very well established, as is its safety profile. That makes it possible for us to make extraordinarily inexpensive, and very large volumes of therapeutic protein, in a system that is safe enough to eat, and that means we can bypass all of the purification steps necessary for a traditional approach. It allows us to finally realize the long-held Gates Foundation’s goal of orally delivering antibody drugs or protein therapeutics,”​ said Finrow.

The process​

The entire manufacturing process is done indoors at Lumen’s integrated Seattle lab and cGMP plant, which has been operational since 2018.

A gene encoding the therapeutic molecule - an antibody, for example - is introduced into the spirulina chromosome. When that strain of spirulina is grown, the cell manufactures the therapeutic protein and stores it away inside the cell.

The production system requires only water, salt, CO2, and light, thereby making it rapid and scalable, said the company.

Harvesting is done by spray-drying the biomass into a powder comprised of spirulina cells, each one ﬁlled with a therapeutic protein ‘payload’. This powder can be packed into dose-speciﬁc capsules, which don't require refrigeration and are shelf-stable at room temperature, it explained.

While the cells do not survive the drying process, the cell membrane protects the therapeutic proteins during transit through the stomach when orally delivered and releases them in the small intestine where they can bind to and neutralize their disease targets, said the firm.

Prophylaxis using the spirulina platform could be affordable, even in the developing world. The fact that the antigen-binding domains and other biologics in dry spirulina powder are shelf stable without refrigeration could facilitate distribution, especially into regions lacking high-quality infrastructure and is another reason why the Gates Foundation is interested in Lumen’s technology, said the CEO.

Disease programs​

Lumen is currently applying the technology to a growing list of highly prevalent diseases.

Its oldest program is Gates Foundation led – it is a single antibody directed at preventing infection by the most common strain of C. jejuni​, which is a major cause of traveler’s diarrhea in Southeast Asia. It is currently undergoing a Phase 2 clinical trial in Baltimore.

BARDA’s CARB-X program is funding the development of a second-generation version of that product, to create a low-cost, edible antibody drug cocktail that blocks infection by two of the main causes of travelers’ diarrhea: enterotoxigenic E. coli​ and campylobacter.​

In terms of additional programs, LMN-201, a complex biologic cocktail for prevention of C. difficile infection, is being run in collaboration with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Rockefeller University. It has completed Phase 1 and is set to enter Phase 2 studies in the summer. “We have cleared the IND.”​

LMN-301 is an antibody cocktail designed for topical delivery. The initial program is directed at the GI manifestations of Covid-19 and is funded by the US Defense Health Agency. It is moving into Phase 2 clinical trials in Brazil this summer. “We have also funding from the Gates Foundation to reformulate that for airway delivery, to prevent or nip infection in the bud after exposure.”​

Another complex biologic cocktail is targeted at treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. And, in collaboration with Novo Nordisk, Lumen is developing orally delivered biologics against GI targets relevant to cardiometabolic disease.",,[],['Jane Byrne']

State researchers extract biomaterial from microalgae for dementia treatment,"[Gettyimages Bank]

SEOUL -- South Korea's state research body has used spirulina, which is a biomass of blue-green algae, to extract a biomaterial that can significantly improve the cognitive functions of dementia patients. Related technology was transferred to a private company for commercial production.As an ecologically sound, nutrient-rich dietary supplement, spirulina is being investigated to address food security and malnutrition. It has been used as a raw material for healthy functional foods with immune and anti-inflammatory functions. Spirulina produces vitamin B6 which generates the body's chemical messengers called ""neurotransmitters.""The Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST) has extracted ""SM70EE,"" the biomaterial that was found to be effective in protecting nerve cells in the brain. The biomaterial can increase cognitive abilities by up to 50 percent compared to existing extracts.In pre-clinical trials, the cognitive function of mice accumulated with dementia-related substances called ""amyloid-beta"" can be improved by about 40 to 90 percent, according to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.The ministry said that 180 people aged 70 and older who regularly consumed SM70EE for three months demonstrated clear improvement in cognitive abilities such as visual memory and vocabulary by up to 50 percent, compared to those who did not consume it.""Through this study, we confirmed the efficacy of marine microalgae in improving dementia,"" Jeong Jae-gwan, a ministry official, said in a statement on May 25. The ministry said that various products using SM70EE can be released to improve cognitive functions.Dementia is a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die. Patients often suffer from memory decline. According to the health ministry, the number of dementia patients in South Korea is projected to reach about 3.3 million by 2060. Data from Statistics Korea, a state-run statistical information service, showed that South Korea would become the world's most aged society by 2067.",,[],['Kim Joo-Heon Reporter']
This Dog Food Company Is Using Unusual Ingredients To Create Healthier Treats For Your Pup & The Environment,"I’m sure many pet parents can relate to the feeling of wanting to give your dog the best of everything – and that includes the food we feed them. But honestly, when perusing the pet food aisle of the grocery store, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the options. How do we know what is the most nutritious choice for our pups? My rescued German Shepherd will eat just about anything, but what should she actually be eating on a daily basis?

If considered its own country, the pet population in the U.S. would rank fifth in global meat consumption — not great for the environment. Now, canines need plenty of protein in their diet, which is why most dog foods contain some type of meat, whether that be chicken, salmon, lamb, or beef. I assumed those were pretty much the only options, but Chippin, a woman-owned dog food company, offers kibble, treats, and meal toppers made from alternative sources of protein that I had never even considered — silver carp, spirulina, and crickets. (That’s right, crickets.) If the mere thought of your dog chowing down on insects makes you a little squeamish, I promise that once you’ve read about how good they are for your pup — and the planet — you’ll be on board.

Science-Backed Superfood Proteins For Dogs

Haley Russell, founder of Chippin, was inspired to create nutrient-rich dog food that promotes a long, happy life for your pet. Chippin’s silver carp jerky is an anti-allergen treat that’s packed with Omega-3s and all 10 essential amino acids to support a healthy skin and coat.

Another one of Chippin’s rockstar ingredients? Spirulina. The protein-packed blue-green algae helps reduces inflammation, boosts your dog’s immune system, and acta as a probiotic to support gut health. Combined with kale, flaxseed, and carrot, Chippin’s vegan spirulina treats are a great way to sneak some extra veggies into your pup’s diet.

Chippin offers a tantalizing cricket-based jerky with prebiotic benefits as well. Beloved by dogs of all ages — from puppies to seniors — Chippin’s chewy jerky treats make great high-value rewards during a training session — or just because.

Are crickets safe for dogs to eat?

Yes! Crickets are naturally rich in Omega-3s, which support the heart, skin, joints, and coat. Crickets are also more digestible than chicken, so your dog’s body can absorb more nutrients. Chippin has several cricket treats available, including a smokehouse BBQ-flavored formula that’s blended with pumpkin and carrots to support vision, as well as an antioxidant-rich option with bananas and blueberries to boost gut health. You can also spice up your dog’s mealtime with a nutrient-rich cricket food topper, which is fortified with apple cider vinegar, sweet potato, and pumpkin — a powerful blend that supports digestion.

Dog Food That’s Good For The Planet

OK, so now that you’ve got the scoop on alternative protein, it’s time to talk about eco-sustainability. All of Chippin’s products are designed with the environment in mind, starting with the ingredients they use. According to the company’s website, one-third of fish stocks are overfished, which is why Chippin sources their silver carp from Kentucky Lake, right off the Ohio River, where there is an overpopulation of the top-feeding fish.

Plus, each bag of Chippin’s alternative-protein treats saves at least 40 gallons of water compared to traditional treats and consumes 80% fewer resources. Not to mention, Chippin is a certified plastic neutral company, which means that they remove as much plastic as they use throughout their entire supply chain.

Bundles For Puppies, Seniors & Low-Fat Diets

Ready to try out Chippin’s alternative protein products for yourself? Luckily, they give you the option to find the treats that will suit your canine friend by bundling them together according to their specific benefits.

From Iceland — New Type Of Spirulina Produced By MýSköpun,"Photo by Arnar/Vísir

According to Vísir, a small innovation company called MýSköpun is producing a new type of spirulina algae found in hot springs around Lake Mývatn. It is said to be the most nutritious spirulina in the world.

Icelanders give books to their loved ones on Christmas Eve, a charming festive tradition which you can adopt wherever you are in the world. Browse the wonderful Icelandic books in our bookstore , and see what literary joy you might like to spread this Christmas.

“We are working with spirulina algae, which was found in the hot springs in Mývatn,” says Júlía Katrín Björke, the CEO of MýSköpun.

She adds that the product is grown inside special tubes designed to optimize algae growth. “It’s like a floating greenhouse. We start by giving the algae food and water and make sure it has access to air and carbon dioxide,” Júlía Katrín explains.

When the spirulina is ready, the product is filtered into powder and used as a supplement. “This is the most nutritious algae that can be grown,” Júlía Katrín reveals, adding that it includes 60-70% protein and a perfect combination of amino acids, minerals and antioxidants.

The company hopes it will be able to showcase the growth process for tourists in the future. “People are excited to see this type of algae brewing while learning a bit about geothermal energy and its utilisation here in Iceland,” Júlía Katrín says.",,[],"['Reetta Huhta', 'Asha Edmondson', 'Emma Ledbetter', 'Andie Sophia Fontaine', 'The Reykjavík Grapevine', 'Arnar Vísir']"
"Bloom system lets users grow their own spirulina ""superfood""","When ingested, nutrient-rich spirulina blue-green algae is claimed to offer antioxidant, immune-boosting and cholesterol-lowering effects – among other things. And while it's typically consumed in powdered form, the Bloom system lets you grow the stuff in your own kitchen.

Bloom is manufactured by British startup Canopi, which claims that fresh, live spirulina is much more nutritious than its dried and powdered counterpart. The company adds that fresh algae doesn't have the ""swampy"" taste of powdered spirulina, plus consumers won't have to worry about the possibility that it was grown elsewhere in contaminated ponds.

The system incorporates two dishwasher-safe, BPA-free polypropylene ""pods,"" which are docked onto a powered countertop base. It also comes with a starter pack of 14 nutrient tablets, along with a live spirulina culture to initially get things going – that culture is sent from the US for North American customers, and from the UK for European customers.

Users start by placing the culture, some water and one of the tablets in one or both of the pods, depending on how many servings of the algae they want to grow at once. The tablet provides the nutrients that the spirulina needs to grow, plus it keeps the water at the optimum pH. The base, meanwhile, maintains the proper light levels and temperature throughout the growth cycle.

After five days, the spirulina should reportedly be ready for harvesting. If the user forgets, a sensor in the system will detect that the algae density in the water has reached a sufficient level, and send a notification via an accompanying app.

Each Bloom pod produces one 5-gram serving of spirulina concentrate Canopi

An integrated air pump is then used to push the contents of the pod though a fine filter, separating a goopy spirulina concentrate from the rest of the water. That concentrate makes up a single 5-gram serving, which can be mixed into a glass of drinking water, blended into a smoothie, or added to foods. That said, a bit of the spirulina has to be set aside, to ""seed"" the next batch.

Should you be interested, Bloom is presently the subject of an Indiegogo campaign. Assuming it reaches production, a pledge of £149 (about US$203) will get you a system – the planned retail price is £249 ($339). Replacement 14-packs of the tablets will go for $8 each.

`

1 She Hydrates

Montana understands the importance of hydration. To get herself to drink more water, she adds lemon to the mix. ""Stay hydrated,"" she captioned a recent photo on Instagram of a pitcher filled with water and lemon slices. ""I drink two litres of water per day,"" she told Women's Health.

2 She Doesn't Diet

Montana doesn't diet. ""I never follow a food plan as such because I don't think they're very good,"" she told Women's Health. ""We all have busy lives, with pressures, why would you want to do that to yourself too? I wouldn't stick to it and I'd end up being disappointed with myself. I just eat healthy when I can. And if I want a burger from time to time I will.""

3 She Eats Healthy

Montana maintains a healthy diet. She tries to eat whole grains, lean protein, and fruits and veggies, keeping sweets to a minimum. ""For the past year, I've found it hard to cut out sugar. But now I've started to use agave honey in my porridge and tea. I've got such a sweet tooth, though, so it's tough cutting out the pic n mix,"" she told Women's Health.

4 She Avoids Refined Carbs at Dinner

Montana is all about balance. However, she does have a few rules. ""You need a balance and I needed a burger. I don't tend to exclude foods but I try not to have refined carbs for dinner. And I try to stick to it between five and seven fruit and veg portions a day. It's quite easy for me as I'll have it with my porridge or in a shake,"" she told Women's Health. df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec

5 She Won't Cut Carbs

Montana maintains that carbohydrates are an essential part of her diet. 'I need carbs in my life as I work really long days and I don't wake up that energized if I cut out carbs,"" she told Women's Health.

6 She Snacks

Montana is all about snacking. ""I am always eating throughout the day as there is nothing worse than going to events or doing shoots and you're hungry. I lose concentration. If I'm doing a workout I will make some swaps like instead of eating something like a rice cake I'll have a protein shake with spirulina and wheatgrass,"" she explained to Women's Health. ""I find nutrition really interesting so have enjoyed researching it over the years.""

7 She Doesn't Drink a Lot of Alcohol

You won't find Montana indulging in a lot of alcoholic beverages. ""Although I'm tee-total at the moment and not drinking makes me feel so much better. I don't even like the way drinking makes me feel, I'm considering giving it up permanently,"" she told Women's Health.",,[],['Leah Groth']
Lumen publishes details of spirulina biomanufacturing platform,"Lumen publishes details of spirulina biomanufacturing platform

2 SHARES

Posted: 24 March 2022 | Hannah Balfour (European Pharmaceutical Review) |

In a new paper, Lumen Bioscience detailed how spirulina can be genetically engineered for to rapidly produce large quantities of biologic drugs.

Lumen Bioscience has published details of the genetic engineering methods it uses to highly express bioactive proteins in spirulina using large-scale cultivation and processing methods appropriate for biopharmaceutical manufacturing. The biomanufacturing platform offers a way to rapidly produce mass quantities of biologic drugs for common diseases that currently lack effective treatments.

The paper published in Nature Biotechnology also details favourable pre-clinical and early-stage clinical testing of these manufactured, orally delivered neutralising antibodies against campylobacter, a major cause of infant mortality in the developing world and a growing antibiotic resistance threat. LMN-101 is now proceeding through Phase II trials and BARDA’s CARB-X programme is funding development of a second-generation version of this product.

“Genetic engineering has transformed the manufacturing of biological products over the past 50 years, yet plant-based biopharmaceutical production has remained an elusive challenge,” commented Dr Jim Roberts, lead author and co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Lumen Bioscience. “Spirulina-based biomanufacturing combines the safety of food-based biotechnology with genetic engineering methods to produce biopharmaceuticals that may address medical needs that current drug-development tools have failed to solve.”

Spirulina, a photosynthetic cyanobacterium, is a highly nutritious food and the only microorganism commercially farmed worldwide as a food. However, previous attempts to convert this safe, scalable food source into a biomanufacturing platform have proven futile. In the new paper, Lumen researchers detail methods for the constitutive and stable expression of protein therapeutics in spirulina, with productivities and potencies tens to hundreds of fold higher than achievable in other food-based platforms. These advances in scalability and potency make orally delivered biologics commercially feasible for the first time.

“Delivering therapeutic amounts of protein biologics to the intestine presents an enormous challenge, and for this reason targets in the [gastrointestinal] GI tract have long been considered almost undruggable,” Roberts added. “The spirulina platform elegantly addresses this challenge. It can be used to produce and deliver the enormous quantities of ingestible biotherapeutics that will be needed to both prevent and treat GI diseases. Preventing and treating diarrhoeal disease, the example reported in today’s paper, offers an excellent case study: these highly prevalent diseases have devastating impacts in the developing world, but traditional drug-making tools have failed to generate a solution despite decades of heavy investment. The approach described in today’s publication offers new hope to the individuals exposed to these diseases.”

Beyond campylobacter, Lumen is currently applying the technology to other highly prevalent diseases, including Clostridium difficile infection, COVID-19, inflammatory bowel disease and cardiometabolic disease.",,[],[]
Gavan sings the spirulina blues for hot and cold drinks,"Gavan said the technology delivers an entirely natural, pure blue that provides high performance and high stability.

Derived from spirulina, the new natural blue holds up under high-heat processing and in low pH, enabling full pasteurization. The platform allows for a full spectrum of stable shades of blue. The new coloring formulation is suitable for hot beverages such as tea and coffee as well as functional drinks and sport drinks. Such products typically require specific production parameters, including infusion in boiling water or an acidic medium.

Vivid blue foods and beverages are eye-catching, however, consumers increasingly want to avoid the artificial additives that is sometimes associated with vivid colors. Gavan said finding an all-around solution to the natural blue problem has been a challenge.

""Both synthetic blue dyes and plant-based blue coloring have regulatory, stability, intensity, or price challenges,""​ said Yael Leader, head of product for Gavan.

""The main barrier to creating food formulations with natural colors is stability—the ability to overcome formulation challenges and ensure vibrant and consistent true blue throughout the product's shelf life.""​

The ""blue challenge"" is even more evident in beverages. Delivering a heat-stable, naturally derived, vibrant blue for products with low pH is tricky, Gavan said. Any heat treatment might impact the color irreversibly, and any shift in the pH can impair color stability and influence the shade of blue.

""A growing trend in beverages is fortified drinks with high amount of vitamins and minerals,""​ Leader said.

""These ingredients can react with the pigment and accelerate the color-degradation process, cause fading, or create a complex binding of pigments and minerals that can deposit sedimentation in the final application.""​

Phycocyanin is a pigment-protein complex found in blue-green algae that naturally produces a pure blue. Gavan utilizes its technology to extract phycocyanin from spirulina and produce a stable, natural blue colorant. Blue is one of the three primary colors and as such, it opens a window to producing other high-in-demand colors—anywhere from non-chlorophyll green to purple shades. These varieties also are highly stable and vivid.

Gavan's non-GMO technology extracts and optimizes the colorant gently, without damaging the source, and enables the extraction of multiple compounds from the whole spirulina, without waste. The technology protects the colorant from fading, even at pH as low as 3.0 or when pasteurized at 90°C for 30 seconds. In addition, the platform's control over particle size offers improved stability throughout the final product's shelf life.

""Gavan's proprietary technology enables us to transform spirulina or other plant-based compounds and sources into easy-to-use, water-dispersible food colorings suitable for hot and cold beverages,""​ said Itai Cohen, CEO and co-founder of Gavan.

""Gavan's blue can replace artificial coloring and opens options for acidic beverages to be colored with any blue shades. It has no impact on flavor, and maintains a clear, clean label. Our advanced platform can revolutionize plant-based products across multiple categories.""​

Gavan's team developed ecofriendly technology to protect the natural compounds in spirulina and other plants while maintaining their complex functionality and purity.

Long-time collaborators Uri Jeremias, a veteran of the restaurant industry who brought his culinary knowledge to the ingredient industry, and Allen Hazan, with experience in designing processes and products, created the new technology after meeting Cohen, an entrepreneur with passion for sustainability and Baruch Dach, a marine biotechnologist and inventor.",,[],['Jim Cornall']

Shopping for CBD Gummies & Other CBD Edibles

When you’re searching for the best CBD products, whether it’s CBD gummies, CBD tablets, CBD capsules, CBD vape pens, CBD vape oil, CBD oil tinctures, or some other CBD oil product, there are a few factors you should always consider before you make a purchase.

First, make sure the CBD product you’re purchasing contains CBD derived from organic hemp plants. Hemp is a powerful phytoremediator, meaning that it sucks up pretty much everything in the soil that surrounds it. If that soil contains pesticides or other harmful chemicals, those toxins will end up in the CBD oil and, ultimately, in your CBD product. So, insist on organic CBD.

Second, CBD oil can be extracted from the hemp plant in a few different ways. Cheaper CBD brands will sometimes soak the hemp in solvents in order to help extract the oil. This can leave behind potentially harmful residues in your CBD. Carbon dioxide is a clean, safe and effective way to extract CBD, so look for companies that employ CO2 oil extraction methods.

Third, the purity and potency of your CBD products can be verified by a lab report generated by a third-party laboratory. All reputable CBD companies will provide such a report for all of their products. If your CBD products don’t come with a third-party lab report, look for products that do.

It’s also important to look at the other ingredients in your CBD edibles. Make sure your CBD brand of choice uses natural ingredients, without artificial additives, flavours, or colours.

Full Spectrum CBD vs Broad Spectrum CBD vs CBD Isolate

You’ll notice on the various product descriptions above that we say things like, “broad spectrum CBD gummies” or “CBD isolate gummies.” This is referring to the type of CBD (cannabidiol) oil in your product.

We classify CBD in three categories: full spectrum CBD, broad spectrum CBD, and CBD isolate. Full spectrum refers to the CBD oil exactly as it is extracted from the hemp plant, containing all of the plant’s cannabinoids (including CBD and trace amounts of THC), terpenes, and flavonoids. As full spectrum oil can potentially contain up to 0.3% THC and the legal THC threshold in the UK is less than 0.2% THC, real full spectrum products that are legally compliant are difficult to find in the UK. Some of the products marked full spectrum on UK shelves are actually broad spectrum.

Broad spectrum oil is the same CBD oil as full spectrum, but with the THC filtered out. Broad spectrum oil is still incredibly robust and, for many, the CBD oil of choice for UK CBD aficionados.

CBD isolate is CBD with all other hemp content filtered out, making it 99% pure CBD. Because CBD isolate has no smell or flavour, you’ll sometimes see it used in products like CBD vape oil or CBD bath products, where the added scents or flavours are the star of the show.

Understanding what each type of CBD oil is and the varying properties of each CBD spectrum can help you more accurately find a CBD product to fit your needs.

Could Spirulina be the next super-nutraceutical to be widely grown in indoor vertical farms?,"Image above: Algae production using a geothermal energy source. Image credit: Algaennovation, Iceland.

Who fancies some blue food? Really?

The theory of food colour confusion may originate from us being strongly aroused by foods on the red spectrum. Research published in Nature recently showed that we are more attracted to red coloured foods as they appear to signal better nutrition with higher calories in comparison to blue or green foods. Trichromatic vision evolved in humans as a response to improve foraging and may explain why we rely more on sight than scent when locating the most nutritious foods and fruits that are ripe and ready to eat. This is surprising to us as ‘leafy green’ farmers when we readily assume a green colour relates to health but the Nature study was more assigned to calorific colour arousal. Although our brains may not easily accept the blue colour as natural, our bodies will probably thank us if we do as blue-green algae also known as cyanobacteria has some of the best health benefits. Superfoods: Yogurt with blue Spirulina, Scottish Damsens, Blueberries and Sloes.

One particular cyanobacteria has been studied extensively over the years

Spirulina grows naturally in alkaline waters and was recognised and farmed by ancient civilisations for its medicinal qualities. The Aztecs of Mexico have a long historical relationship with Spirulina. They farmed Spirulina in large lakes, then harvested and air dried the algae to form a hard edible ‘cake’. This was often mixed with other foods and used as an energy source as these ancient people recognised it as an important functional food.

Massive health benefits that many people have still to discover

People who move beyond the colour tend to use blue-green algae for supercharging the immune system, controlling muscle spasms, detoxing heavy metals, eliminating candida, improving memory and increasing energy levels to improve exercise performance. It may also lower cholesterol and blood sugar, acting to prevent heart disease, heal wounds and improve digestion. Pretty impressive qualities for this single celled life form billions of years old.

There are two main species of the blue green algae Spirulina, Arthrospira platensis and Arthrospira maxima. As the image demonstrates, they are made up of single cells containing chlorophyll filled vesicles that react to light and photosynthesize like plants. Cultivation of commercial algae usually starts the life cycle in lab culture tubes, doubling quickly under controlled conditions. This helps to eliminate contaminants. Spirulina is the largest single celled blue green algae and it forms spirals visible to the human eye which bunch together to allow a quick harvest and is now cultivated worldwide as a nutritional supplement.

Spirulina is high in iron, calcium, magnesium, copper, beta-carotene and B-vitamins.

Apart from the high content of protein, Spirulina contains B vitamins, particularly B12 and provitamin A (β-carotenes), and minerals, especially iron. It is also rich in phenolic acids, tocopherols and γ-linolenic acid. Spirulina does not have a cellulose cell wall so it is more easily digested. Most people selling dried Spirulina suggest 1-8g per day to boost the immune system but be careful as too much can have negative effects so it’s best to start with the lowest dose.

Some suggest Spirulina has the power to tackle world wide problems like malnutrition. The UN and WHO recommend Spirulina for it’s extremely high nutritional value and sustainability. It has even been called the ‘world’s most sustainable food’ with the potential to end world hunger. The Pole Pole Foundation in the Congo were finalists in the Earthshot Prize recently. They are leading the way to teach communities in developing countries how to grow Spirulina as a supplement to prevent childhood malnutrition.

Could Spirulina be an alternative vegan protein source?

Would you drink blue milk? Many vegans are looking for alternative sources of protein. Spirulina might even be a protein source of the future and a substitute for cow’s milk. Spirulina platensis stands out for being one of the richest protein sources of microbial origin having similar protein levels when compared to meat and soybeans. Not to be confused with regular green Spirulina in its basic form, blue Spirulina is an extract of the active ingredient phycocyanin in its purest form. This concentrates the dried extract with higher levels of antioxidants without so much of the fishy taste of fresh Spirulina. But if you don’t mind using fresh Spirulina (it’s fishy so it’s much better to mix with stronger flavours) it will provide protein that is quickly and easily absorbed in the body compared to animal proteins which is a bonus as it contains many essential amino acids that the body cannot synthesize alone and are essential for tissue renewal.

Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory

Fresh Spirulina is high in antioxidants, especially phycocyanin, the pigment which causes the blue green colour. Phycocyanin can promote blood cell regeneration, improve lymphocyte activity and improve the lymphatic system. Studies have shown this antioxidant scavenges and fights the free radicals that cause oxidative damage.

Spirulina is known to be alkalizing to the body which boosts beneficial microflora in the gut. Liver function is improved and this greatly increases detoxification levels in the body. Fresh Spirulina contains chlorophyll and phycocyanin both of which help to remove toxins such as heavy metals and other pollutants from the blood. One remarkable study in children who lived close to Chernobyl after the nuclear disaster in 1986 found that giving them a small 5g dose of Spirulina a day could reduce radionuclide rates by half in less than two months.

Spirulina has Cancer fighting benefits

Spirulina has been hailed as an anticancer superfood, but reading further into peer reviewed literature is important as there are some extrapolated and conflicting reports from doing a simple google search. So here we only present peer reviewed data. From our research low dose Spirulina has anti-proliferation effects on stomach cancer cells, human leukaemia cells and B lymphoma cells, inhibiting carcinogenesis.

Eating Spirulina daily may lead to increased energy levels

Fresh Spirulina is particularly good for energy owing to its high nutrient density. Since the algae has no cell wall to break down, digestion of all those nutrients is fast and efficient. It can make a difference to energy levels quickly after consumption. Fresh Spirulina contains constituents such as polysaccharides (Rhamnose and Glycogen) and essential fats that are absorbed easily by cells and theoretically aid energy release. More studies are needed to be truly conclusive though but with low toxicity levels in the body, it’s well worth your own trials.

Spirulina enhances energy performance because it unlocks sugar from our cells. If you are suffering from memory loss, this bacteria added daily to your routine appears to have significant effects. It does this by protecting the brain from free-radical damage by increasing the activity of two enzymes: catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which fight free radicals and make the brain more resistant to aging.

But It’s not all good news

Spirulina may exacerbate autoimmune reactions in some people who are susceptible. As such it may worsen symptoms of multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions linked to overactive immune systems. It’s also not recommended for pregnant women or children or people on blood thinners like warfarin. Be cautious where you purchase Spirulina, as it may be contaminated if not bought from a quality source, leading to additional side effects.

Bioavailability: Should it be dried or is live culture better?

Image credit: Ecoduna, Austria If you search for Spirulina online you are mainly going to encounter powdered products. There is nothing wrong with these as most research was conducted on using powdered forms which still showed positive results. However some reports suggest fresh Spirulina has up to 95% bioavailability. This means that 95% of the nutrients including essential amino acids, all the B vitamins and antioxidants are absorbed straight into your bloodstream increasing potency by 45% compared with powder.

How difficult is it to cultivate and commercialize?

Spirulina cultivation requires sufficient aeration, agitation and proper light intensity for enhanced biomass yield, cell productivity, specific growth rate and protein content. Biomass yield has the potential to reach up to 12g/l biomass in a closed reactor system. Urea seems to be a promising alternative source of low-cost nitrogen for Spirulina cultures and addition of mechanised aeration will significantly increase yields.

But what about algal blooms? Are they the same Cyanobacteria?

Spirulina itself is non toxic but other forms of blue green algae including Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, grown and harvested in the wild, is often contaminated and leads to toxic conditions when out of control.

Blue-green algae occurs naturally in lochs, ponds, reservoirs, rivers and the sea. This summer in Scotland it became a real issue. When the conditions are right, blue green algae will create massive blooms so large they can be captured by satellite imaging from space. Blooms are accelerated by leaching of fertilisers, with nitrogen and phosphorus runoff into the water course which becomes detrimental to other life forms by blocking oxygen and releasing toxic microcystins.

So it’s a logical step to grow these in a controlled environment and if market conditions continue to accelerate consumer demand for functional foods then growing these super algae in CEA could be highly profitable for farmers.

Image credit: Earthrise The largest US producer of Spirulina is based in California and they produce on an open 108 acre site, exporting to over 20 countries worldwide. There are disadvantages of open ponds as they do not reach high biomass productivity due to the difficulty of maintaining the optimum temperature and so they are restricted to tropical and subtropical regions. This is mitigated to some extent with large paddles constantly moving the ponds.

Despite this hefty competition, CEA could be the perfect vehicle for growing a crop that has incredible health properties, sequesters CO2 and can be grown in tubing to eliminate contamination. With LED lights and agitation, enhanced yields could be harvested year round.

This could be particularly useful between the shoulder winter months to increase profits and farm skills where wholesale prices have the potential to return profits of up to $15/Kg . A rough estimate of 12g/L biomass can be achieved with a photobioreactor system incorporating PPFD 166 μmol photons m−2 s−1 with potential doubling every 2-6 days depending on the algal species chosen. Based on this, and assuming you harvest 50% at each doubling time, a microfarm running 100L tanks could harvest 0.6Kg every 2 days, giving a total annual yield of 106.2Kg and a potential maximum annual return of $1593. Scaling up production will make more economic sense. Optimizing and automating additional technology (LED lighting, CO2 enhancement and state of the art infrastructure as seen with Algaennovation) may boost production but this must be carefully managed to balance a return on investment.

Learning and applying new ideas – food, fuel & carbon trap

Image courtesy of Energy Futures living laboratory project, Lille France We like to get people talking about the future diversity of CEA. This helps drive innovation and creates wider jobs and skills. At the same time we aim to help you better understand the science and health prospects of plants that could be grown in CEA. Of all the ideas out there, maybe our favourite is the idea of an algae curtain. Glow in the dark tubes of algae obscure prying eyes from your space while producing your own superfood or fuel. Could plants literally fuel plants in a completely carbon neutral circular economy? Biodiesel produced using algae contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and highly biodegradable. This could have potential in offsetting CEA energy outputs and algae fuel cells could make home farms more economically sustainable in the future. There are so many applications for algae, some are even using it to extract CO2 from brewing. Whatever reason you have for growing Spirulina and others (chlorella) there is no doubt about this being classed as a superfood.

Closer to home we like the way CEA farmers are looking to diversify their product range and kudos to On the Grow farms in Rockwall, Texas, growing spirulina alongside their microgreens. They grow in demijohn bottles adjusting the salinity to 2 and pH 10.5-11, harvesting and topping up fresh water every day. In order to maintain high pH and avoid fluctuations, high amounts of sodium bicarbonate must always be included in the culture medium to buffer the solution. The water needs aeration and temperature needs to be tightly regulated to 80F. LED lights will speed up production and your farm will literally bloom. Image credit: On The Grow Farms, Texas

Spirulina first rose to fame as a potential space food. Maybe in space our brains are altered by gravity to be more accepting of blue food. Or maybe we will discover a whole new superfood bacterial species on Mars or deep in the ocean. So who’s got a spare shelf in their vertical farm for this blue superfood and space age protein milk shake? Janet Colston PhD is pharmacologist with an interest in growing ‘functional’ foods that have additional phytonutrients and display medicinal qualities that are beneficial to human health. She grows these using a range of techniques including plant tissue micropropagation and controlled environmental agriculture to ensure the highest quality control.

Toxic To-Go Containers Linked to Liver Disease,"Fluorinated chemicals known as polyfluoroalkyl or perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFASs), which include PFOA and PFOS, can be found in most Americans.1 The widely used chemicals have been added to industry and consumer products since the 1940s, but while PFOA and PFOS have been phased out in the U.S. due to their toxic properties, other PFAS are still in use.

Because the chemicals break down very slowly in the environment, they’ve been dubbed “forever chemicals,” and there’s concern that exposure to these toxins may be a significant contributor to liver disease, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).2

Liver Disease Is a Public Health Epidemic

NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in developed countries,3 characterized by a buildup of excess fat in your liver that is not related to heavy alcohol use. Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, weight and smoking all play important roles in exacerbating (as well as reducing) your chances of developing some form of liver disease.

While alcohol consumption certainly doesn’t help liver health, the rise in NAFLD is likely related more so to increased intake of toxic industrially processed seed oils, often referred to as vegetable oils, along with exposure to environmental chemicals, including PFAS.

Globally, about 25% of people are affected by NAFLD. In the U.S., prevalence is expected to rise to 100.9 million, or about one-third of adults, by 2030. Without proper treatment, NAFLD can lead to serious liver problems including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.4

Exposure to PFAS Linked to Liver Disease

PFAS are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that accumulate in body tissues, such as the liver, and are known to accelerate metabolic changes that lead to fatty liver. “This bioaccumulation,” researchers wrote in Environmental Health Perspectives, “coupled with the long half-lives of many PFAS, leads to concern about the potential for PFAS to disrupt liver homeostasis should they continue to accumulate in human tissue even if industrial use is abated.”5

The researchers, from the Keck School of Medicine of USC, conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, yielding 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies. Four types of PFAS — PFOS, PFOA, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) — accounted for most known human exposure.

The study compared PFAS exposure to indicators of liver injury including serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), NAFLD, NASH or steatosis, a buildup of fat in the liver. Meta-analysis from the human studies showed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA, PFOS and PFNA.

In addition, exposure to PFOA was also linked to higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels — two widely used markers of liver disease — in humans. Rodents were also affected, with those exposed to PFAS tending to have higher ALT levels and steatosis.6 “There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies,” the researchers concluded.7

While it’s unknown exactly how PFAS may be damage the liver, its hepatotoxicity may be due to a combination of the following:8

Promotion of liver inflammation and triglyceride accumulation

Altered lipid metabolism

Reduced bioavailability of choline, triggering steatosis due to choline deficiency. Choline, an essential nutrient, supports normal liver function and liver health, helping it to maintain membrane integrity and manage cholesterol metabolism, including low density lipoproteins and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), helping to move fat out of your liver 9

They pointed out that newer PFAS, which have been used to replace the “legacy” PFAS that were phased out of use in the early 2000s, have similar chemical structure and properties, and therefore likely have similarly toxic effects.

Also unknown are what effects these ubiquitous chemicals have after combined exposures, as well as risks of exposure to the most vulnerable populations — infants, including in utero, and children. “This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PFAS, mixtures and early life exposures,” they explained.10

“We see that the prevalence of NAFLD in humans is increasing but the explanations are unclear,” said study author Sarah Rock in a news release. “Though the human research connecting PFAS to liver disease is limited, there is much evidence in animal research showing hepatotoxicity of PFAS.

A challenge for PFAS researchers is that humans are exposed to mixtures of hundreds if not thousands of these chemicals. Mixture analyses is one potential tool for addressing this complexity in the future.”11 Study author Elizabeth Costello added:12

“This research clearly shows that PFAS need to be taken seriously as a human health concern because even after they are phased out, they persist in the environment. There is enough evidence, we believe, to demonstrate a need to clean up sources of exposure to PFAS and to prevent future exposures.”

PFAS Pose a Significant Risk to Human Health

It’s not only the liver that suffers from exposure to PFAS. In May 2015, more than 200 scientists from 40 countries signed the Madrid Statement, which warns about the harms of PFAS chemicals and documents the following potential health effects of exposure:13

Liver toxicity Disruption of lipid metabolism, and the immune and endocrine systems Adverse neurobehavioral effects Neonatal toxicity and death Tumors in multiple organ systems Testicular and kidney cancers Liver malfunction Hypothyroidism High cholesterol Ulcerative colitis Reduced birth weight and size Obesity Decreased immune response to vaccines Reduced hormone levels and delayed puberty

Exposure to high levels of PFAS is also known to affect the immune system, and evidence from both human and animal studies shows that such exposure reduces antibody responses to vaccines and may also reduce your resistance to infectious disease.14 The U.S. EPA also acknowledges that PFAS exposure is harmful and states that peer-reviewed scientific studies have shown exposure to PFAS may cause:15

Reproductive effects such as decreased fertility or increased high blood pressure in pregnant women Developmental effects or delays in children, including low birth weight, accelerated puberty, bone variations or behavioral changes Increased risk of some cancers, including prostate, kidney and testicular cancers Reduced ability of the body’s immune system to fight infections, including reduced vaccine response Interference with the body’s natural hormones Increased cholesterol levels and/or risk of obesity

Food Packaging Is an Overlooked Source of Exposure

If you’re wondering how you may be exposed to these toxic chemicals, food packaging is a common culprit, particularly for fast food and processed foods. Grease-resistant to-go containers, papers and wrappers often contain PFAS. This includes fast food containers and wrappers, microwave popcorn bags, pizza boxes and candy wrappers.16 Even foods from health food stores like Whole Foods may be packaged in containers loaded with PFAS.

In fact, a 2018 study released by consumer watchdog groups Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families and Toxic-Free Future revealed that Whole Foods Market was the biggest offender in their analysis of paper products coming in contact with food. They found high levels of fluorine — a sign that the packaging contains PFAS — in five of the 17 items tested, four of which were containers in the salad and hot food bar.17

In another study, about one-third of the approximately 400 fast food wrappers and containers tested were found to contain fluorine, which suggests perfluorinated chemicals were used to give the paper a slick surface, making it oil- and grease-resistant. “We found that 46% of food contact papers and 20% of paperboard samples contained detectable fluorine,” the researchers explained.18

Since the chemicals migrate into food and contaminate compost piles and landfills after disposal, the use of PFAS leads to unnecessary long-term exposure to harmful chemicals for humans, wildlife and the environment, especially since PFAS-free packaging options are widely available.

How Else Are You Exposed to PFAS?

PFAS can be found in water, soil, air and food. They are in your home, including in household products like stain- and water-repellant fabrics, cleaning products, nonstick cookware and paint — and likely in your drinking water.

According to a 2016 Harvard study, 16.5 million Americans have detectable levels of at least one kind of PFAS in their drinking water, and about 6 million Americans are drinking water that contains PFAS at or above the EPA safety level.19 The highest concentration levels of PFAS were found in watersheds near industrial sites, military fire training areas and wastewater treatment plants. Private wells have also been found to be contaminated.

PFAS have no taste or smell, so it’s wise for virtually everyone to filter their water with a high-quality carbon filtration system. To be certain you’re getting the purest water you can, filter the water both at the point of entry and at the point of use.

You can also be exposed to PFAS by eating seafood caught in water contaminated with the chemicals, by swallowing contaminated soil or dust and by using PFAS-containing personal care products, which include shampoo, dental floss, nail polish, eye makeup and more.20

Given these chemicals’ pervasive and persistent use, everyone would be well served by following the Madrid Statement’s recommendation to avoid products containing, or manufactured using, PFAS, which include most that are stain-resistant, waterproof or nonstick. To further reduce your exposure, the Environmental Working Group recommends avoiding:21

Items that have been pretreated with stain repellants; opt out of such treatments when buying new furniture and carpets. Water- and/or stain-repellant clothing. One tipoff is when an item made with artificial fibers is described as “breathable.” These are typically treated with PTFE. Items treated with flame retardant chemicals, which includes a wide variety of baby items, padded furniture, mattresses and pillows. Instead, opt for naturally less flammable materials such as leather, wool and cotton. Fast food and carry out foods, as the wrappers are typically treated with PFAS. Microwave popcorn. PFAS not only may be present in the inner coating of the bag, it also may migrate to the oil from the packaging during heating. Instead, use “old-fashioned” stovetop popcorn. Nonstick cookware and other treated kitchen utensils. Healthier options include ceramic and enameled cast iron cookware, both of which are durable, easy to clean and completely inert, which means they won’t release any harmful chemicals into your home. A newer type of nonstick cookware called Duralon uses a nonfluoridated nylon polymer for its nonstick coating. While this appears to be safe, your safest bet is still ceramic and enameled cast iron. Oral-B Glide floss and any other personal care products containing PTFE or “fluoro” or “perfluoro” ingredients.

"Smoothie diet: Benefits, Weight Loss, and Downsides","The 21-Day Smoothie Diet is a weight loss plan touted as an easy and effective alternative to fad diets. In fact, the creator of the plan claims that the diet is associated with a long list of benefits and can help improve sleep, keep your skin glowing, skyrocket energy levels, and increase weight loss almost instantly. However, there are several serious downsides associated with this program, and it may do more harm than good in the long run when it comes to your health. This article will take a closer look at the 21-Day Smoothie Diet, how it works, and some of the negative risks and side effects it may be associated with. Share on Pinterest Lindsay Crandall/Stocksy United

What is it? The 21-Day Smoothie Diet is a weight loss plan developed by health coach Drew Sgoutas. The plan involves swapping two of your meals each day with smoothies, and the principles of the program are outlined in the e-book, “The Smoothie Diet,” which is available online for $47. The e-book includes 36 smoothie recipes, meal and snack ideas, shopping lists, weekly schedules, and tips for preparing the smoothies and maintaining weight loss long-term. According to Sgoutas, the 3-week diet plan can help promote healthy eating, enhance immune function, detoxify the body, improve skin and gut health, and rev up energy levels. Sgoutas also claims that the diet can boost weight loss. In fact, some testimonials displayed on the website claim that the plan led to up to 9 pounds (4 kg) of weight loss in just 3 days. summary The 21-Day Smoothie Diet is a 3-week diet plan that involves replacing two meals per day with smoothies. The program claims to enhance immunity, boost energy levels, improve skin and gut health, and increase weight loss quickly.

How to follow it The 21-Day Smoothie Diet involves replacing two of your meals each day with smoothies using the recipes found in the e-book. There are 36 recipes provided in the book, created using ingredients like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and almond or coconut milk. In addition to these two smoothies, the plan allows you to eat one solid meal per day and two healthy snacks. Solid meals should consist mostly of whole foods, and snacks should be low in sugar and high in fiber, with around 150–200 calories per serving. You are also allowed one cheat day per week where you don’t consume any smoothies, though meals should still consist mostly of whole, minimally processed foods. Optionally, you can kick off the plan with a 3-day detox, which requires you to consume a smoothie in place of all three daily meals, with two healthy snacks in between. According to the program’s website, the diet works by creating a calorie deficit, meaning that you are expending more calories than you consume each day. The diet is also high in fiber and claims to help reset your taste buds to reduce sugar cravings. The program is intended to be followed for 3 weeks but can be repeated as many times as needed until you ‘reach your goal weight.’ summary The 21-Day Smoothie creates a calorie deficit by replacing two of your meals with smoothies and eating one solid meal and two snacks per day. The plan should be followed for 3 weeks and can be repeated as many times as needed.

Foods to eat and avoid The 21-Day Smoothie Diet encourages nutrient-dense foods like fruits and vegetables while limiting processed ingredients. Foods to eat Most of the smoothie recipes included in the 3-week program consist of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, mixed with coconut milk, coconut water, or almond milk. Additionally, the plan emphasizes whole, minimally processed foods for your remaining meals and snacks while following the diet. Some specific examples of foods that are encouraged on the 21-Day Smoothie Diet: Fruits: bananas, pears, apples, oranges, pineapples, raspberries, strawberries

Meanwhile, the plan limits processed foods such as refined grains, convenience meals, and sugary drinks.

Does it aid weight loss? According to the 21-Day Smoothie Diet creator, the plan provides a total of around 1,500 calories per day. Consuming 1,500 calories per day will lead to weight loss for many people. However, this may vary based on many different factors, including your age, body size, health status, and activity level ( 1 ). The diet also encourages a variety of nutrient-dense foods, like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, all of which are high in fiber. Fiber moves through the digestive tract slowly, helping to keep you feeling fuller for longer, which could support weight loss ( 2 , 3 ). However, despite being low in calories and high in fiber, the 21-Day Smoothie is also very restrictive and can be difficult to follow. Furthermore, research suggests that liquids, such as smoothies, are less filling than solid foods, meaning you may feel more hungry drinking mostly smoothies each day ( 4 ). Not only that, but some studies show that weight loss programs that use meal replacements may be associated with a higher risk of weight regain once a typical diet is resumed (5, 6). Therefore, while swapping some of your meals for smoothies may lead to short-term weight loss, it’s unlikely to be effective long-term. summary The 21-Day Smoothie Diet is low in calories, plus high in fiber, which may lead to short-term weight loss. However, studies suggests that smoothies may be less filling than solid foods. Additionally, the plan may be difficult to follow and could increase the risk of weight regain.

Downsides and side effects In addition to being restrictive, unsustainable, and difficult to follow, the 21-Day Smoothie Diet may have several other downsides and side effects. Increases risk of nutrient deficiencies Eating just one solid meal per day and replacing your remaining two meals with smoothies may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies. Though the smoothie recipes recommended by this program contain nutrient-dense ingredients like fruits and veggies, they also omit or limit many of the foods typically included in a balanced meal, such as whole grains, healthy fats, and lean proteins. Some are also low in protein. For example, the Green Detox smoothie — made with kale, coconut water, bananas, ginger, and lemon — contains less than 4 grams of protein per serving. That makes it challenging to ensure you’re meeting your protein needs, negatively impacting tissue repair, muscle growth, immune function, and more ( 7 ). Additionally, though the diet claims to provide around 1,500 calories per day, most the smoothie recipes are very low in calories and unlikely to provide enough calories to meet the needs of most healthy adults. Consuming too few calories each day can slow your metabolism and cause serious negative side effects, including hunger, nausea, headaches, and fatigue ( 8 , 9 ). May be high in sugar Many of the smoothies on the 21-Day Smoothie Diet contain multiple servings of fruits, including bananas, pineapples, peaches, and strawberries. Some also contain other high sugar ingredients, such as honey or granola. Though these ingredients can be enjoyed as part of a healthy, balanced diet, the high amounts included in this diet may not be suitable for everyone. In particular, people with diabetes may need to monitor their intake of foods high in carbohydrates, such as fruit or honey, to prevent spikes in blood sugar levels ( 10 ). Not based on evidence One of the biggest flaws of the 21-Day Smoothie Diet is that there is no research to back it up. While smoothies can be a great addition to a well-rounded diet, there’s no evidence to show that eating smoothies in place of other nutrient-dense foods can improve your skin, gut health, or immune function, as the diet claims. Furthermore, the diet’s official website is filled with testimonials from customers claiming to lose large amounts of weight very quickly. Not only is this unrealistic and unsustainable, but it could also be harmful to health ( 11 ). summary The 21-Day Smoothie Diet is not based on evidence and may be associated with an increased risk of nutritional deficiencies. It is also relatively high in carbs and sugar.",,[],"['Rachael Link', 'Ms']"

What science says about veganism for athletes,"You’ve probably heard countless stereotypes about vegan athletes. Maybe you’re even convinced that there’s a grain of truth to some of these beliefs. But what science says about veganism and exercise may surprise you. And with a growing interest in environmentally-friendly lifestyles, it’s more important than ever to bust the myths that surround vegan athletes.

So what exactly is veganism? According to the Vegan Society (opens in new tab), veganism is ‘a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude – as far as is possible and practicable – all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose’. As such, vegan diets completely cut out meat, dairy and eggs, but they also don’t allow foods that use animal derivatives, such as honey, shellac or bee pollen.

Understandably, many may doubt whether such a restrictive way of eating can help athletes to step up their fitness game. Here, we’ll dive into some common misconceptions about training on a plant-based diet and look at some of the potential benefits of veganism for athletes. We will also provide useful tips on how to achieve peak performance if you do follow a plant-based diet.

Veganism for athletes: common myths

There are so many myths doing the rounds about veganism for athletes, so let's have a look at some of the most common.

Myth #1: ‘Vegans are malnourished and get ill a lot’

One of the biggest myths about plant-based diets is that they lack many important nutrients and may subsequently lead to malnutrition. However, evidence suggests this isn’t the case.

According to a study published in Nutrition Reviews (opens in new tab), vegan diets tend to consistently rate higher than others in terms of their quality and nutritional value. They may also provide many health benefits. Multiple studies, reviewed in Current Nutrition Reports (opens in new tab), have reported that plant-based diets can reduce the risk of developing several different types of cancer. They can also boost longevity and protect against cardiovascular problems, as demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis in Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine (opens in new tab). So as long as you follow a well-balanced diet, there’s no need to worry.

Myth #2: ‘Vegans can’t get enough protein’

“But where do you get your protein from?” If you’re a vegan (or have considered becoming one), it’s almost a given that you’ve been asked this question. There’s a strong belief that animal-based products are the only good sources of protein, but in reality, this isn’t the case. Indeed, meat, dairy and eggs provide a great deal of this important macronutrient, but so do beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, soy-based products (such as tofu and tempeh), spirulina and many types of grains. Even certain vegetables, such as broccoli, asparagus, leafy greens and sprouts will top up your protein intake.

Myth #3: ‘Vegans suffer from low energy levels’

A common stereotype is a lethargic, weak vegan who can’t get through the day without taking a nap. While a myth, it could be true in certain cases. Plant-based diets that are balanced and contain all necessary nutrients will not lead to excessive fatigue. However, if you’re deficient in vitamin B12 and iodine – which are found mostly in animal-based foods – you may experience a drop in your energy levels.

That’s why it’s important for vegans to make sure that their diet and supplements provide enough of these micronutrients. It’s also worth mentioning that many people experience exhaustion during the first few weeks of transitioning to a vegan diet. It’s perfectly normal, and once the body gets used to a new diet, the feelings of tiredness pass.

Myth #4: ‘All vegan diets are healthy and promote weight loss’

Is a vegan diet healthy? If done right, plant-based diets can be extremely beneficial for athletes. But with the abundance of vegan processed foods available on the market these days, it’s quite easy to make the wrong choices. If your entire diet is based on foods rich in fats, sugars and starchy carbohydrates, you’ll not reap any health benefits. Similarly, plant-based foods can be great for weight loss as they tend to have more dietary fiber and a lower calorie density. Still, if you’re continuously eating more calories than you burn, even the healthiest meal plan can make you put on a few pounds.

Myth #5: ‘Vegan diets will slow down your recovery’

Recovery is an essential part of every training program. This is when your torn and exhausted muscles rebuild themselves to get bigger and stronger. When your body is nourished properly, your muscle soreness should get better after a day or two of rest.

A well-rounded vegan diet may actually speed up your recovery, because of the high level of anti-inflammatory compounds found in plant foods. Phytonutrients like antioxidants may help to lower the burning sensation in your muscles and get you back on track sooner. For competitive athletes, a quick recovery means more time spent training, and ultimately, better end results.

Potential benefits of a vegan diet for athletes

There are definitely benefits to be had for those athletes who decide to go vegan. Here are a few perks that going vegan can offer you.

Body composition

The ability to grow and maintain muscles is the cornerstone of many different types of sports. It’s even more important for competitive bodybuilders, because how they look and present themselves is crucial to their success on stage.

“One of the biggest misconceptions surrounding vegan diets is the belief that plant-based foods can't provide enough protein to build any muscle,” says Liam Holmes, performance nutritionist, Foodspring (opens in new tab) ambassador and owner of pH Nutrition (opens in new tab). “Most meat-eaters argue that protein from animal sources contains all the essential amino acids needed for muscle development, and therefore it is of higher quality than plant protein.”

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

So is it possible to build muscle on a vegan diet? “The answer is: ‘absolutely’,” says Holmes. “More and more studies are now showing that you can build muscle on any diet that gives you enough protein, paired with resistance exercise. All whole plant foods have protein and by mixing different foods together you can get a complete source of essential amino acids that make up protein.”

And available evidence seems to confirm this. Results from a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in Nutrients (opens in new tab), indicate that protein source does not affect changes in muscle mass or muscle strength. However, it may influence the percentage of lean muscle mass in relation to the fat mass, especially in younger adults.

Lastly, most athletes rely on protein supplements to fuel up their workouts. The best vegan protein powder , protein bars and snacks may be more beneficial for those who suffer from gastrointestinal issues or are sensitive to dairy, which is the main protein source in many animal-based products. Plant protein may even be better for our gut health , as indicated in Frontiers in Nutrition (opens in new tab).

Endurance training

Intensive aerobic training comes with a unique set of challenges and difficulties. If done to a reasonable level, it can be highly beneficial for metabolic, cardiovascular and mental health. However, studies (opens in new tab) suggest that competitive runners, swimmers and cyclists are at higher risk of developing atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries due to a buildup of cholesterol) and inflicting damage to their heart muscles. They also need to closely watch their diet to keep their energy levels high.

According to a comprehensive review published in Nutrients (opens in new tab), plant-based diets have a wide-ranging impact on cardiovascular efficiency and energy metabolism.

“The vegan diet is associated with an increased carbohydrate consumption which can be seen, in some sports, to benefit performance,” says Jess Hillard, nutritionist at Warrior (opens in new tab). “This also comes with high fiber, which can be seen to provide volume to the diet and increase satiety for the athlete, which can help with sports that require lower body weight and ensure athletes stay satisfied after meals. This also accompanies research which has found that vegan diets are associated with lower fat mass, specifically seen in runners.”

What’s more, plant-based diets can help to lower blood pressure and improve blood flow by improving the arterial flexibility and the internal lining of vessels. At the same time, they may significantly decrease the blood lipids and cholesterol levels. As a result, vegan diets can help reverse atherosclerotic changes and boost the flow of oxygen to the heart muscle.

A study published in Diagnostics (opens in new tab) also suggested that a plant-based diet has a direct impact on VO2max (a measurement of aerobic capacity), as well as the structure and functioning of the heart.

Strength training

Two factors will dictate how much you can lift, push or pull: how much heavy resistance training you do and how good your diet is. Your food choices will impact the size of your muscle fibers and the ability of your nerves to activate them.

According to a review published in Nutrients (opens in new tab), research studies haven’t been able to demonstrate consistent differences in strength performance between vegan and omnivorous diets. Interestingly, on many occasions, it was plant-based diets that achieved better results.

In another study, also published in Nutrients (opens in new tab), crossfit-trained participants went on a vegan diet for four weeks and had their exercise performance measured throughout the intervention. A control group was following a mixed, omnivorous diet during the same time period. The study has found no significant differences in performance between these groups, with the exception of the vegan group achieving better results at a strength endurance test.

Similarly, a study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (opens in new tab) compared the strength of vegan and omnivorous young women by measuring their leg and chest press. Vegans were as strong as those eating an animal-based diet.

Lastly, strength training may involve a lot of muscle and joint inflammation. Jessie Jones, nutrition coach at OriGym Centre of Excellence (opens in new tab), points to the anti-inflammatory properties of a vegan diet.

“There’s a strong link between meat consumption and inflammation,” she says. “In athletes this can cause joint issues, muscle fatigue, and longer recovery time. By cutting out meat, and reducing your inflammation levels, you’ll have more energy to use for training and you’ll protect areas from impact too.”

Tips for vegan athletes

If you're thinking of switching to a vegan diet, here are some top tips to ensure you're getting everything you need to fuel your active days.

Make sure to get enough calories

“A common mistake people make when following a plant based diet is to under consume overall calories,” says Holmes. “Plant based foods can often be higher in volume and fiber meaning people feel fuller and end up eating less.”

When we exercise, our bodies burn a lot of calories and fueling up our muscles the right way can make a big difference to our performance. As a vegan athlete, you may need to get used to eating bigger portions and more frequent meals.

Know your protein

As discussed, getting the right type and amount of protein is crucial to your exercise performance. Good plant-based sources of complete protein (containing all the essential amino acids) are soy-based products (such as tofu and tempeh), quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, spirulina, hemp seeds, chia seeds and nutritional yeast.

Individual plant-based protein sources tend to lack one or more essential amino acids, therefore eating a wide variety of different food items will further increase your chances of getting good quality protein.

Avoid nutrient deficiencies

Plant-based diets are very nutritious, but it’s almost impossible to obtain enough vitamin B12 without resorting to supplements. But that’s not the only nutrient that may be in short supply on a vegan diet. It’s also worth remembering that if you train a lot, your nutritional requirements are way higher than those of an average person. Being a vegan athlete, you may struggle to get sufficient amounts of certain nutrients with food alone.

According to a review in the Journal of the International Society of Sport Nutrition (opens in new tab), vegans who engage in high levels of physical activity may experience vitamin B12, iron, zinc, calcium, iodine and vitamin D deficiencies. They may also find it difficult to get enough omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, as they are found predominantly in fish.

“While it is true that a meat-based diet has adequate amounts of iron, B vitamins, calcium and zinc, all of which help your body to stay healthy and recover from exercise, it is a myth that these requirements cannot be met with a vegan diet,” says Holmes. “All you need to do is to pay a little extra attention to where these nutrients are coming from and include a wide variety of these foods in your diet. Excellent plant sources of B vitamins include nutritional yeast, tahini, wheat germ, peanut butter, flaxseeds, legumes, beans, nuts and seeds.

“Important sources of zinc can be found in fortified breakfast cereals, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, tahini, pine nuts, and cashews. Pairing iron foods with vitamin C rich foods, such as lemon with lentils, or dark chocolate with strawberries, can remarkably improve the absorption of iron in vegans. Fortunately, there are many good quality supplements that are suitable for vegans too.”

Consider creatine and β-alanine supplements

Many professional athletes rely on a wide range of legal performance-enhancing supplements to get the best results possible. A review in the Journal of the International Society of Sport Nutrition (opens in new tab) reported that vegans could particularly benefit from creatine and β-alanine supplementation.

(Image credit: Getty Images)

Creatine can help to increase muscle mass and strength, while beta-alanine aids in the production of carnosine – a compound that increases muscle endurance during high-intensity exercise. Since plant-based diets promote lower muscle creatine and lower muscle carnosine levels, adding these supplements could make a big difference to your sports performance.

Post Covid Foods: What is Spirulina? Why people are consuming it more in COVID times,"



In India also, there are some players who make nutri-bars with Spirulina, apart from selling it as tablets, capsules, powder, but the market, though now small, is expected to grow and is attracting newer players.

Based in Tamil Nadu's Karur district, Prolgae Spirulina Supplies Pvt. Ltd is soon to hit the market with its Spirulina protein bar and sweetened Spirulina powder.

""We have been exporting our sun dried organic Spirulina to Europe. After Covid-19 there is increased awareness and demand for nutritional supplement food. In India we want to get into the consumer market launching protein bars and sweetened spirulina powder,"" S. Akas, Founder CEO, Prolgae, told IANS.

According to Akas, an aeronautical engineering graduate, the two products will be launched on August 15 and talks are on with gyms to stock the products.

The products developed by Prolgae will be contract manufactured by the Delhi-based Swasthum.

However, the immunity booster product segment is wide including the age-old chyawanprash and new players have to find a positioning niche.

""We are also talking with the nutritionists about our product and its health benefits. We will launch the products in the four metro cities first and expand to other markets and also have our own e-commerce site,"" Akas added.

""Globally about 8,000,½10,000 tpa of Spirulina is manufactured. In India we are the largest player with about 700-800 tpa production. We produce organic premium Spirulina,"" Srikanthan said.

According to him, the Parry Nutraceuticals-division of EID Parry- has about 30 per cent market share in the global premium organic Spirulina market.

Tamil Nadu is one of the major producers and exporters of Spirulina with players like EID Parry, Sanat Products part of Schwabe group, Prolgae Spirulina and others.

There are several smaller players whose products go to other sectors like fish/poultry feed and others.

""The high-end product will be about 2,000 tpa of which our market share will be about 30 per cent. In India we are the largest player with about 700-800 tpa production. We produce organic premium Spirulina,"" Srikanthan said.

According to Akas, Prolgae's sundried organic Spirulina gets about Rs 1,300-1,500/kg in the overseas market.",,[],[]

Global Algae Proteins Market to Reach $1.1 Billion by 2026



Alternative proteins are likely to benefit from increasing popularity of protein bars and snacks among health-conscious individuals. The increasing shift away from beef towards beans is driving manufacturers to offer algal protein-based options at affordable price points. Algal proteins are known for their numerous health benefits over their animal-based counterparts. Based on its disease-fighting properties due to the presence of phytonutrients and fiber, spirulina is enjoying mainstream presence as functional food ingredient and natural food colorant. The popularity of plant-based proteins is encouraging manufacturers to exploit phytoplankton and chlorella as key strains. On the flip side, plant proteins often lack specific essential amino acids needed for growth of the body. In addition, researchers are yet to fully understand bioavailability and digestibility of algal proteins. These factors point towards the need for more scientific evidence for demonstrating quality of products based on algal proteins. Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market for Algae Proteins estimated at US$771.3 Million in the year 2020, is projected to reach a revised size of US$1.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 6.6% over the analysis period. Spirulina, one of the segments analyzed in the report, is projected to record a 7.1% CAGR and reach US$698.1 Million by the end of the analysis period. After a thorough analysis of the business implications of the pandemic and its induced economic crisis, growth in the Chlorella segment is readjusted to a revised 6.1% CAGR for the next 7-year period.



The U.S. Market is Estimated at $221.4 Million in 2021, While China is Forecast to Reach $176.1 Million by 2026



The Algae Proteins market in the U.S. is estimated at US$221.4 Million in the year 2021. China, the world`s second largest economy, is forecast to reach a projected market size of US$176.1 Million by the year 2026 trailing a CAGR of 8.8% over the analysis period. Among the other noteworthy geographic markets are Japan and Canada, each forecast to grow at 4.8% and 6.4% respectively over the analysis period. Within Europe, Germany is forecast to grow at approximately 5% CAGR.



The market is expected to be fuelled by continuing transition of consumers from animal-based towards plant-derived products. The trend is responsible for growing popularity of plant-based options such as soy and wheat proteins. However, rising incident of allergies related to soy and gluten is driving companies to shift their attention toward algal proteins. Algal proteins are anticipated to also gain from increasing availability of scientific validation related to the use of microalgae as proteins along with rising concerns over sustainability and carbon emissions. Apart from the environmental and vegan credentials, the primary driver of algae proteins is the demand for healthy food, owing to the increasing consciousness for healthy lifestyles. Health foods such as health drinks and functional beverages are increasing in popularity owing to their health benefits as well as their refreshing capabilities. Algae proteins such as chlorella find extensive application within health foods and functional beverages, driving the market for algae proteins across the globe. The demand from pharmaceutical and skin care industries is expected to drive demand for algae proteins in future. In addition to the protein content, algae proteins also offer multiple benefits including vitamins & minerals, as well as essential fatty acids such as Omega-3 and Omega-6, further driving the demand for algae proteins.



By Source, Freshwater Segment to Reach $743.7 Million by 2026



Freshwater algae are being extensively cultivated in artificial fresh water given the robust demand from the nutraceutical and food & feed industries. By Source, global Freshwater Segment is estimated at US$518.5 Million in 2020, and is projected to reach US$743.7 Million by 2026 reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of 6.1% over the analysis period 2020-2027. Europe constitutes the largest regional market for Freshwater segment, accounting for 30.6% of the global sales in 2020.

Spirulina benefits: Effects of spirulina on sport performances,"Spirulina is type of blue-green algae rich in nutrients and antioxidants and it is also one of the most popular nutritional supplements in the world. As a result, spirulina is associated with a number of positive health effects, most notably effects which apply to the area of sport performances.

Here, we take a closer look at how spirulina affects sporting performances.

First of all, spirulina is 55-70 percent protein, which is a percentage significantly larger than those of beef (25 percent protein) and eggs (13 percent). Therefore, this makes spirulina a key source of long-lasting energy for athletes, whilst assisting them with muscle growth and improving stamina.

Given that it is algae, it is also far easier than the likes of lentils, beef and cow's milk to digest, as there is no extra cell membrane to break down. Whilst the net protein use of spirulina is around 52 percent, those of lentils, beef and cow's milk are 30 percent, 15 percent and 12 percent respectively.

Furthermore, spirulina contains a pigment called phycocyanin which gives it its unique blue-green colour. It is a key antioxidant which assists athletes with anti-inflammation. This can be a significant aid to athletes given the amount of physical stress which they endure on a regular basis.

What other health benefits does spirulina bring?

Aside from a strictly sporting perspective, there is evidence that spirulina may have anti-cancer properties and that it may reduce blood pressure.

For example, in a recent study in India involving 87 people with precancerous lesions, among those who took one gram of spirulina per day for one year 45 percent of these people saw the lesions disappear.

With regards to a reduction in blood pressure, a dose of 4.5 grams per day has been proven to reduce the blood pressure of individuals with normal levels.",,[],[]

Suffering from seasonal allergies? Here’s how to stop them,"Whether you like it or not, warmer weather has returned and brought its favorite sidekick along with it: seasonal allergies. Here’s everything you need to know in order to kick itchy eyes and runny noses to the curb.

Why it matters: Pollen levels are only increasing, leaving more and more people to deal with seasonal allergies.



A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal in February 2021 reported a lengthening of the pollen season by 20 days and a 21% increase in pollen concentrations between 1990 and 2018, reports Yale Medicine.

What they’re saying: Leonard Bielory, an allergy specialist at the Rutgers University Center of Environmental Prediction, spoke on the rising amount of allergies, saying, “We’re seeing increases in both the number of people with allergies and what they’re allergic to,” according to a study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.

What to do: There are many over-the-counter options to help minimize allergy symptoms.



Yale Medicine allergist Dr. Florence Hsu recommends starting out with antihistamines for itching and runny nose, steroid nasal sprays to help with nasal congestion or antihistamine eye drops for itchy eyes, according to Yale Medicine.

Decongestants from popular brands like Benadryl, Vicks or Afrin may offer additional relief.

If you are in need of something a bit stronger, allergy shots might work for you. Dr. Sima Patel, allergist at New York Allergy and Sinus Center, says allergy shots can improve symptoms for up to 85% of patients, depending on the study you reference, per SingleCare.

This Food Tech Is Making Smoked Vegan Salmon From Spirulina Algae,"3 Mins Read

Israeli’s SimpliiGood has revealed that it has successfully prototyped a smoked salmon analogue made purely from spirulina algae. The development is cited as being the first of its kind. The company already produces products including meat substitutes, drinks and ice cream. This will represent its first foray into alt-seafood, a globally growing sector.

A prototype, demonstrating uniform portion sizes, recognisable aesthetics and distinctive texture, has been unveiled. SimpliiGood claims it is on par with conventional salmon. To bring the development to market, a strategic partnership has been signed with global conglomerate IFF. The two are eying a portion of the $5.2 billion smoked salmon market through the offering of the sustainable alternative.

The science behind the superfood

SimpliiGood claims its salmon is defined by two groundbreaking elements. The first is the development of clean salmon-like chunks, made exclusively from spirulina algae, via proprietary methods. The second is the identification of viable pigments from the same algae to leverage the orange colour associated with conventional salmon.

The company describes its fresh algae as a superfood that is entirely free of all environmental pollutants, which underscores the clean-label promise of its salmon. Sustainability has been a defining motivation for the company since its inception, making a move into alt-seafood significant.

“The tremendous damage of the animal food industry to climate change sharpens the need to develop sustainable protein substitutes,” Lior Shalev, CEO of SimpliiGood said in a statement. “SimpliiGood is proud to lead this field in the Israeli ecosystem, to grow and collaborate with the world’s leading food companies in order to bring a healthy, delicious and quality product without compromise. We are hurting animals and the environment. We welcome the collaboration with the international giant IFF, which is expanding our development line and bringing us into the huge market of fish substitutes and later on, to others.”

Israel’s growing alt-seafood sector

According to a just released report, Israeli’s alt-protein industry scored record-breaking investment in 2021. Within the various stats and data points, one glaring fact stands out: of 11 new startups founded in 2021, five are alt-seafood focussed. Sea2Cell, E-FISHient Protein, Forsea, Wanda Fish and Plantish are all names to know. The latter has already celebrated two significant wins.

In January this year, fellow Israeli startup Plantish unveiled its ultra-realistic salmon fillet to the world. The plant-based whole-cut confused and impressed, with its nuances of muscle and connective tissue. Made entirely from vegan ingredients, the fillet was debuted with a commercial launch date of 2024 cited. That date suddenly became a lot more tangible, following the just-announced over-subscribed seed round the startup has concluded, netting $12.45 million.



Outside of Israel, the whole-cut seafood space is heating up. Salmon is front and center for Dutch brand Vivera- it revealed its own plant-based fillets priced at a lower cost than conventional fish. San Francisco’s Current Foods made its plant-based smoked salmon available for B2C delivery and fellow SF startup Wildtype just netted $100 million. The investment was sought to assist with scaled distribution of cultivated sushi-grade salmon throughout the U.S., pending regulatory approval.

King of superfoods: what is spirulina and how can it improve my health?,"Promotion

Spirulina is one of nature's most potent sources of nutrients - Credit: Nimrod Genisher Photography

Renowned for its wide-ranging health benefits and powerful antioxidant properties, spirulina is one of the most popular supplements in the wellness world.

It’s best known in its dried powder form, but did you know that it’s also available as a fresher, healthier food, delivered straight to your door?

We chat to Michael Drane, founder of Pure Foods, the UK’s only fresh spirulina supplier based in Norfolk, about the benefits of this nutrient-rich superfood and how it can help you enjoy a happier, healthier life.

Q: Firstly, what exactly is spirulina?

Fresh spirulina has a range of health benefits, from boosting energy to improving digestion - Credit: Nimrod Genisher Photography

A: Simply put, spirulina is a type of blue-green algae, and one of nature’s most potent sources of nutrients. It’s packed with amino acids, antioxidants, vitamins, proteins, iron and calcium, which is why it’s often referred to as the ‘king of superfoods’. Pure Foods’ spirulina is very different to the powder supplements you find in health food stores – ours is 100 per cent raw, fresh and can be consumed everyday as part of a healthy diet.

Q: What’s the difference between fresh spirulina and the powder supplement?

A: Raw spirulina is a food product and has a much higher nutrient and protein content, which means it’s better for your body. It comes straight from where we grow it in Israel and is flash-frozen to lock in the nutrition and prolong its longevity, so you get the best of both worlds. There’s no dehydration or heat treatment involved – it's 100 per cent fresh and plant-based, making it suitable for vegans. The absorption rate of fresh spirulina is also much higher than the powder version.

Q: Who can benefit from it?

Spirulina is completely natural and can be consumed as part of a healthy diet - Credit: Nimrod Genisher Photography

A: Everyone can benefit from the nutrition found in spirulina – men and women, adults and children, elite athletes and gentle exercisers. Consuming it daily can help to boost your immune system and enhance your fitness goals and active lifestyle. It has also been shown to help with iron deficiencies, and recent studies have found it can help with some of the long-term effects of Covid-19.

Q: What are the health benefits of spirulina?

A: Spirulina is proven to have a range of physical and mental benefits, including:

Increased energy – iron helps to alleviate mental fatigue, reduce anxiety and improve sleep, while protein creates long-lasting energy release

– iron helps to alleviate mental fatigue, reduce anxiety and improve sleep, while protein creates long-lasting energy release Healthy blood flow – vitamin b12 reduces fatigue and lowers blood pressure

– vitamin b12 reduces fatigue and lowers blood pressure Boosted immune system – amino acids boost the immune system, while antioxidants prevent cellular damage and reduce inflammation-related health issues

– amino acids boost the immune system, while antioxidants prevent cellular damage and reduce inflammation-related health issues Better digestion – calcium helps regulate body fat while natural fibre enhances gut health, resulting in a more efficient metabolism.

Q: How should I consume it?

Pure Foods spirulina can be used in a variety of tasty recipes - Credit: Nimrod Genisher Photography

A: Consistency is key. Spirulina needs to be taken on a regular basis for you to feel the full health benefits. Our fresh produce is taste-free and odourless, which makes it easy to add into your daily diet. I recommend a serving of 20g each day, and we've got some great recipes on our website.

It’s also worth bearing in mind the quicker you consume it the better – it’s a living product, so the faster you can get it into your body the more benefits you’ll feel. It usually takes around a month to feel a difference to your health.

Q: Is it safe to consume spirulina every day?

A: Some powdered supplements can include chemicals that could cause some minor side effects, but our spirulina is completely natural and contains no chemicals or additives, which means it’s safe to consume daily.

Q: Where can I get it from?

A: Pure Foods is the only company in the UK delivering fresh, natural spirulina to your door. Each punnet is weighed out into 20g serving sizes and is easy to add to smoothies, juices or breakfast bowls. If you’re new to the superfood, you can try our one-week supply trial.

Spirulina is a blue-green alga that has taken health and fitness by storm in recent years and this is not surprising considering its many benefits. Spirulina is usually consumed in powder form or as a supplement and is considered an excellent source of protein and vitamins for vegans and vegetarians. This article outlines the most important health benefits of adding spirulina to your diet.

Cholesterol Prevents the oxidation of LDL cholesterol

Fatty parts in our body are more prone to oxidative damage, which leads to several diseases. This process is known as lipid peroxidation. Spirulina contains antioxidants that are proven to be effective in reducing lipid peroxidation. Supporting this fact, a study conducted on participants with type 2 diabetes proved that consuming 8 grams of spirulina every day helped in reducing markers of oxidative damage.

Allergic rhinitis Reduces the symptoms of allergic rhinitis

Allergic rhinitis or hay fever is an allergic response to allergens like pollen, dust mites, mold, wheat dust, frequent headaches, etc. Symptoms usually include sneezing, an itchy nose, coughing, hives, and fatigue. While the severity of the allergy varies from person to person, a study proves that spirulina can relieve several symptoms including runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and itching.

Diabetes Helps in controlling blood sugar levels

Laboratory studies on animals show spirulina can reduce sugar levels and are at par or better than traditional diabetes medicine like Metformin. A study on type 2 diabetes patients, who consumed 2gm of spirulina daily, showed their HbA1c levels decreased from 9% to 8%. This is significant because scientists believe even a 1% reduction in this marker can lower diabetes-related death risk by 21%.

Cancer Reduces the risk of oral cancer

Studies conducted on animals have shown that spirulina helps in reducing the occurrence of cancer and tumor size, too. Another study conducted on participants with precancerous lesions in the mouth showed promising results. When the participants took 1gm of spirulina every day for a year, lesions in 45% of them had disappeared. However, when they stopped taking it, almost half of them redeveloped lesions",,[],[]

Pune, India, Feb. 15, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global spirulina market size is projected to expand speedily owing to the potential benefits of spirulina for COVID-19 patients, finds Fortune Business Insights™ in its report, titled “Spirulina Market, 2022-2029”.

A study published in the journal ‘Marine Biotechnology’ in February 2021 by scientists from Israel and Iceland propounds that extracts from blue-green algae can prevent COVID-19 patients from getting seriously ill. According to the scientists, a derivative of enhanced spirulina can reduce the probability of the cytokine storm triggered by the coronavirus in the lungs, which can cause acute respiratory distress, by 70%. This is possible because the extract from this alga contains a pigment-binding protein that augments anti-inflammation, anti-tumor, and anti-oxidation activities in the body.

Another study, conducted in June 2020 by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), found that spirulina extracts can potentially inhibit the entry of SARS, MERS, and SARS-2 spike pseudotyped virus in vitro. Thus, the coronavirus outbreak is likely to boost the adoption of natural algae extracts and brighten the outlook of this market.

Driving Factor



Spirulina-based Innovations by Startups to Drive Market

The emergence of startups in the algae-based foods domain is driving innovation and fueling the spirulina market growth. These startups are focused on developing algae-based food items, with an aim to cater to the demands of the growing vegan population. For example, in February 2019, Prolgae, a startup based in India, created vegan chocolate bars and cookies formulated from spirulina and its extracts. Furthermore, this species of algae is also seen as a potential instrument against malnutrition, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), prompting a few companies to produce algae-based food items and make them accessible to all. In October 2018, for instance, Proalgae announced its plans to produce high-quality, sun-dried spirulina to fight malnutrition in India and Africa. Some other startups intend to popularize this alga’s super-food status. For example, SNACK Brand, a startup launched in January 2021, will be developing farm-fresh versions of this alga in the form of clusters and powders and combine them nutrient-dense ingredients, such as flax seeds and dry fruits.

Regional Insights



Widespread Production of Spirulina to Propel the Asia Pacific Market Growth

Asia Pacific is anticipated to command the spirulina market share during the forecast period owing to the high production of the algae in Korea, China, and Indonesia. The increasing blending of this algal species with nutraceuticals in non-dairy products is expected to further support the regional market growth. The market in Europe will be majorly driven by the soaring demand for natural food colors in the continent. In countries such as France and the UK, the rising adoption of veganism and growing demand for natural, nutrient-rich ingredients in the food industry will also aid the regional market. Similar trends are foreseen in North America as well, where the preference for clean-label food and beverage products is steadily increasing.

Competitive Landscape

Advancements in Food Formulation Technologies to Energize the Market

The dynamics of this market are being steered and shaped by the sophistication in food formulation technologies heralded by research institutions and private companies. The advent of spirulina in the food industry has opened multiple avenues of innovation in this market and key players are tapping these opportunities by stepping up their investments in research & development activities, thereby cementing their position in the market.

Hoppy Urban Brew (aka HUB) — based in the city of Roubaix, not far from the Belgian border — teamed up with a company called Etika Spirulina which grows spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, that is then supplied to the brewery to give the beer its blue hue, according to Reuters. The hope is that the eye-catching drink — which gets its color from the compound phycocyanin — can also help Etika Spirulina promote its algae as a dietary supplement.

""It's getting an enormous amount of interest and curiosity on the part of the public,"" Sebastien Verbeke, the brewery's co-founder, told the news outlet. HUB is reportedly already working on ramping up production after 1,500 bottles of the 3-percent ABV brew (which is called Line) sold out over the last three months of 2021.

""We started to brew our blue beer after we met Etika Spirulina's team two years ago,"" Verbeke told Food & Wine over email. ""First it was a kind of a challenge to have a blue pigment and not the green that you can have when you use raw spirulina."" But after rounds of testing, the brewers finally came upon a recipe that achieved the color — and taste — they were looking for. ""We are now thinking to share our research with all people interested [in duplicating] this experience as long as they do that on a local scale,"" he added.

Despite its blue color, the beer itself is billed as a session IPA. ""It's quite disconcerting,"" HUB's Mathilde Vanmansart explained while tasting the beer, ""because since it's blue, our brains expect a certain note, but, no, we really have here a session IPA, a very light beer, and the flavors of the beer really come through. We can taste that it has a light alcohol content with quite the taste of hops, with slight notes of citrus. And in the back of the mouth, there's a slight taste of lychee. It's quite refreshing.""",,[],"['Mike Pomranz', 'February']"

15 Vegan Protein Sources That May Surprise You,"As long as people keep asking about it, we’ll keep talking about protein. The subject is a seemingly never-ending black hole of conversation when it comes to vegan diets, but it really doesn’t have to be that complicated. A vegan diet can contain a bounty of protein sources, and there’s no need to worry about developing a protein deficiency or experiencing a lack of variety in meals (check out these high-protein vegan recipes). All whole foods contain protein (we’ll repeat that later, because it deserves repeating), and here are the best vegan protein sources to fulfill your daily needs and satisfy the relentless questions from omnivores about where vegans get their protein.

LyfeFuel

How much protein do you need?

Protein deficiency is typically not an issue in first-world countries. That’s not to say protein is not important, because it’s extremely essential to life and optimum health, but industrialized nations tend to put an enormous emphasis on an issue that doesn’t really affect them. America’s protein obsession is a bit like Southern Californians worrying about hypothermia—it’s not completely out of the question during a cold January night, but it’s very unlikely. For the vast majority of people, it’s not necessary to count your protein intake, but if you’re curious, it’s fairly simple to calculate. The USDA’s Recommended Daily Allowance is 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight. To calculate your protein needs, multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36, and the result is the number of grams of protein you need each day. For example, a 130-pound woman should aim for 46.8 grams of protein per day, and a 170-pound man should aim for 61.2 grams of protein per day. Note: this formula is designated for the “average” individual—someone who may exercise on occasion but not at high intensities nor a majority of the week. Those who are more active—who exercise at a moderate to high intensity at least four days a week—should aim for 0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight. This is a general guideline—to truly optimize performance, a plant-based dietitian can help fine-tune your exact protein needs based on your activity level.

Are plant proteins complete proteins?

Complete versus incomplete protein isn’t discussed much in the vegan community other than to respond to omnivores in their attempt to make plant-based proteins seem inferior to animal-based protein. Most people—omnivore or otherwise—don’t pay attention to how much complete versus incomplete protein they consume on the daily, but as soon as someone goes vegan, it becomes a major concern to the outside looking in. Esteemed physicians—including Dr. Neal Barnard, Dr. Colin Campbell, and Dr. Michael Greger—have stressed the fact that as long as one eats enough calories and varies their diet, they will meet their protein needs regardless of whether they consume complete or incomplete protein.

If you’re suddenly wondering if the foods you enjoy are complete or incomplete, here’s what you need to know. Protein is made of 20 different building blocks known as amino acids. The human body can make 11 of these amino acids on its own, but the other nine must be obtained from food sources. These nine building blocks are called essential amino acids. Not all foods contain all nine amino acids. These are called incomplete proteins. The foods that do contain all nine essential amino acids are called complete proteins. With the exception of foods such as soy, hemp, quinoa, chia seeds, pea protein, and buckwheat, most plant-based foods lack a few essential amino acids. That’s not to say they’re inferior sources of protein, because people eat a variety of foods, and incomplete protein sources naturally complete each other. Think rice and beans, hummus and pita bread, peanut butter sandwiches … the list is endless. Eat a varied diet, eat enough calories to sustain your body, and you don’t have to worry about complete versus incomplete protein.

The best vegan protein sources

Every single whole food contains protein, but some pack in significantly more than others. This list isn’t comprehensive—you’d need a textbook to list them all—but here is a list of some of the best high-protein vegan foods.

1 Seitan

This meaty vegan staple is mostly made from vital wheat gluten which is extremely high in protein. There’s a whopping 18 grams of protein in a mere two-ounce serving of seitan. Many vegan meats rely on seitan for their chewy texture, but you can also purchase it in its original form and season to your tastes (try Upton’s Naturals). Those who enjoy DIY can make their own seitan fairly easily. Here’s a recipe if you’re into that.

2 Beans

Beans are not a singular food—they’re a category. While many are content with sticking to just a few varieties, there are dozens of kinds of beans that all have a unique taste and texture—not to mention a significant amount of protein. Lima, fava, black, pinto, kidney, cannellini, and garbanzo beans all contain between 12-15 grams of protein per cup, cooked. While not called a bean, black-eyed peas are also high in protein, weighing in at 13 grams per cup.

3 Tofu

The protein content of tofu fluctuates slightly, as it depends on the type of tofu you buy. The firmer the tofu, the more protein, as firm tofu is more concentrated than the softer options. For example, a three-ounce serving of extra-firm tofu contains nine grams of protein, while silken tofu hovers around four grams. Many brands (like Wildwood) also offer a high protein variety, and those contain upwards of 14 grams of protein.

4 Tempeh

Finish your tempeh bacon—it’s high in protein. Also made from soy, tempeh naturally contains a substantial amount of protein—a three-ounce serving contains 18 grams! This crumbly, meaty vegan protein source is an excellent base for a good marinade. Try it yourself with this smoky tempeh peanut satay recipe.

5 Protein powder

While not a whole food, there’s no denying that plant-based protein powder will help you reach your daily quota. Most vegan protein powders contain between 15-20 grams of protein. If you’re looking for a product with complete protein, opt for soy or pea protein-based brands such as 22 Days Nutrition or NuFYX.

6 Spirulina

This powdered algae does more than turn smoothie bowls into a pretty blue—it’s a super concentrated protein source. Just one tablespoon packs in four to six grams of protein (the green variety is lower on the scale, whereas blue spirulina contains slightly more protein). The next time you’re at a smoothie bar, opt for the menu item with spirulina (or Blue Majik, as some call it) for an extra dose of protein.

7 Plant-based milk

The latest US Dietary Guidelines—revised in late 2020—now state that fortified soy milk is nutritionally equivalent to cow’s milk. This is huge, as it completely undermines one of the dairy industry’s strongest arguments for drinking milk. Cow’s milk has eight grams of protein, it’s true, but so does soy milk. Pea milk also contains eight grams of protein, and some brands (like Califia Farms and Silk) are fortifying their plant-based milks with even more protein—up to 10 grams per eight-ounce serving. Check out this guide to find the right high-protein vegan milk for you.

8 Nuts, seeds, and butters

Like beans, the nuts and seeds category is huge. When looking for the seeds with the most protein, lean toward a 30-gram serving of hemp seeds (12 grams), chia seeds (seven grams), and flax seeds (nine grams). High-protein nuts include peanuts (7 grams), almonds (6 grams), and brazil nuts, cashews, walnuts, pine nuts, hazelnuts, and pistachios (all 4 grams) per 1-ounce serving. Nut and seed butters have similar protein profiles.

9 Nutritional Yeast

Fondly referred to as “nooch” in vegan circles, these yellow flakes are packed with nutrients. Two tablespoons of this cheesy-tasting condiment amount to five grams of protein. Not sure what to do with a canister of nooch? Check out 16 Ways to Use Nutritional Yeast.

10 Non-dairy yogurt

Like plant milk, dairy-free yogurt can contain a good amount of protein, depending on the brand. For the largest protein dose, seek out a product with added protein, such as Kite Hill Protein (11 grams) or Chobani Oat (seven grams).

11 Quinoa

If you’re looking to up your protein intake, swap out rice for quinoa. This sturdy grain contains eight grams of protein per one cup, cooked. Quinoa also makes for a terrific, satiating porridge. Change up your next bowl of morning oats for this belly-warming Sticky Banana Bread Quinoa Breakfast Bowl.

12 Lentils

No matter the color—green, brown, yellow, or red—lentils are protein powerhouses. A quarter cup serving (dry), will provide 10-12 grams of protein, depending on the variety. Not sure how to prepare them? Start with this easy Vegan French Lentil and Kale Stew.

13Spinach

The cartoon may have exaggerated the protein powers of spinach slightly, but there was some truth to Popeye the Sailorman’s spinach-chugging philosophy. The leafy green provides just over five grams of protein per one cup, cooked. Go ahead and be liberal with it. We love adding it to smoothies, soups, pizzas, pastas, and big bowls of salad.

14 Bread

Excluding the white varieties (sorry, sourdough enthusiasts), bread can top off your daily protein quota. Varieties such as whole wheat and Ezekiel bread contain four and eight grams of protein per slice, respectively. Don’t fear bread, just choose the higher protein options.

15 Vegetables

Spinach isn’t the only veggie with a decent amount of protein. Greens such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus all hover around four grams of protein per cup; collard greens contain five grams of protein per cup; and a large potato comes in at just under eight grams of protein. There’s more than one reason to eat your vegetables!

"Buyer, beware — cyanobacteria toxins in supplements are a serious health risk","While out shopping, my partner noticed a bottle of shampoo that contained ""blue-green algae"", a colloquial name for what are actually cyanobacteria, a group of bacteria that growth via photosynthesis. She showed me the shampoo, expecting an amused chuckle or excited grin, because the organisms were the topic of my research. I didn't chuckle or grin: cyanobacteria are notorious for making toxins.

There are a wide variety of different cyanotoxins (a toxin made by cyanobacteria) that can harm humans, wildlife, and livestock. Cyanotoxins can be very potent. Some have toxicities that are comparable to, or in some cases more potent than, cyanide. Symptoms of cyanotoxin intoxication in humans and other mammals include salivation, incontinence, muscle tremors, paralysis, and respiratory failure for the neurotoxins anatoxin and saxitoxin and vomiting, lethargy, abdominal pain, and internal bleeding for the microcystin liver toxins. Many toxin-producing cyanobacteria grow to form large, harmful blooms that can shut down municipal drinking water supplies when their toxins contaminate drinking water.

But it's not just shampoo. Some kombucha also contain cyanobacteria, and cyanobacteria are legally sold as dietary supplements, where they are marketed as ""super foods"" that are high in vitamins and protein. These ""blue-green algae"" products are both popular and profitable. The global algae protein market was valued at approximately $703 million in 2019, and cyanobacteria protein alone accounted for over 40 percent of this market value.

The ability to produce toxins varies widely between species. Primarily three types of cyanobacteria are sold as dietary supplements or in beauty products: Arthrospira platensis, Arthrospira maxima, and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Due to an old naming convention, Arthrospira species are typically marketed and sold as ""Spirulina."" They have a long history as a food source for humans and are generally recognized as nontoxic and safe. Commercial Arthrospira is grown in outdoor, industrial ponds designed to selectively maintain near monocultures of Arthrospira and avoid the growth of toxic cyanobacteria. However, maintenance problems do occur, and cyanotoxins have been detected in some Spirulina products, which indicates that industrial ponds sometimes become contaminated with toxic cyanobacteria species.

In contrast to the Arthrospira species used to make Spirulina supplements, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (the organism used in the shampoo), produces neurotoxins. Aphanizomenon species used in dietary supplements are harvested from the wild, a trait that manufacturers often flaunt in their product descriptions. Since the 1980s, nearly all commercially available Aphanizomenon flos-aquae is harvested from Upper Klamath Lake in Oregon, USA, where dense cyanobacteria blooms regularly occur. Because of this, Aphanizomenon supplements are sometimes marketed as “Klamath Lake algae.”

Since it is wild-harvested, the source material used for Aphanizomenon supplements always contains a complex mixture of cyanobacteria species that changes over time and with conditions at the collection site. So, supplement manufacturers have less control over the types of cyanobacteria that are included, which increases the risk of cyanotoxin exposure from taking Aphanizomenon supplements.

Despite the risks to people who take cyanotoxins, current dietary supplement regulations are not adequate to protect consumers

Although there is inconclusive evidence that the Aphanizomenon species that grow in Upper Klamath Lake produce neurotoxins, microcystins have been regularly detected in Upper Klamath Lake, and the state of Oregon has issued toxicity warnings for the area in the past, which supports a legitimate concern for the ingestion of cyanotoxins in Klamath Lake algae supplements. In fact, one study showed that dietary supplements made with Klamath Lake algae can contain concentrations of microcystins up to 60 times higher than safety standards set by Oregon state. Some Klamath Lake algae products have microcystin levels that can surpass safe levels for drinking water set by the World Health Organization by up to 683 percent. Klamath Lake algae supplements showed toxic effects in human cells and arthropods, and reports of acute toxicity linked to cyanotoxins in dietary supplements exist for both dogs and humans. And, even low levels of microcystins may increase the risk of developing liver cancer.

However, the true risk of toxicity when using cyanobacteria supplements is hard to estimate because there is a large amount of variation in the amount of cyanotoxins measured from lot to lot, and many supplement manufacturers do not provide suggested doses on their product packaging. Therefore, the amount of cyanotoxin consumed in dietary supplements is likely highly variable between products. Even the low levels of cyanotoxin measured in some contaminated Spirulina products may be a concern if product packaging gives consumers the green light to consume as much as desired or when cyanobacteria supplements are consistently used.

Despite the risks to people who take cyanotoxins, current dietary supplement regulations are not adequate to protect consumers. In the United States, dietary ingredients and supplements are regulated by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act. Under these rules, products legally marketed before 1994 are ""grandfathered"" into safe status, which includes Spirulina products. This means that no pre-market evaluation or organized clinical dose-escalation studies for Spirulina-based supplements are required by US law.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) still requires that dietary supplement manufacturers follow current good manufacturing practices, and reporting of adverse effects is required by law. But these do not prevent cyanotoxin contaminated products from reaching store shelves. The US Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), an official FDA-recognized organization that sets standards for dietary supplements and food ingredients, has safety standards for Spirulina products. However, under the FD&C act, compliance with USP is strictly voluntary for dietary supplements – meaning that USP standards are not guaranteed unless the product packaging is labeled as ""USP verified"". And because USP quality standards only exist for Spirulina products, Aphanizomenon supplements (which are more likely to contain harmful toxins) have the least regulatory oversight.

Despite all the risks involved in taking cyanobacteria supplements, one would think there must be some genuine health benefits that consumers can weigh against intoxication risks when considering supplementing their diets with cyanobacteria. Supplement product labels tout the nutritional and medicinal benefits of both Aphanizomenon and Spirulina, which includes statements such as high protein and antioxidant content, lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, aiding blood sugar control, retaining hair moisture, and improving muscle strength and endurance. Research has little to say about cyanobacteria supplements' effects on hair, but a recent review of 25 clinical trials with cyanobacteria supplements showed some potential in reducing oxidative stress, improving cholesterol content, and reducing blood sugar. However, the same study found that most of the clinical trials reviewed did not meet typical quality standards; studies without double-blinding had to be included in order to have enough literature to review.

The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, which is maintained by the US National Institutes of Health, states that there is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of blue-green algae supplements for nutrition and to treat most diseases. In fact, the only condition these supplements are rated ""possibly effective"" for is high blood pressure. The purported health benefits are simply a marketing gimmick.

In short, there is little or no health and nutritional rewards for consuming cyanobacteria that offset the real and concerning risk of cyanotoxin exposure. Ideally, consumers should avoid ingesting cyanobacteria all together, but consumers interested in a diet that includes cyanobacteria can take precautions to ensure they do so safely. Read the product labels, and avoid all products made with Aphanizomenon or Klamath Lake algae. Stick to purchasing pure Spirulina products from companies that are USP verified and willing to publish data on cyanotoxin content, so that you can make informed decisions about safe dosing.",,[],['Derek Smith']
What Does Chlorella Do for Your Body?,"If the trendy teal blue smoothie bowl (it gets its eat-with-your-eyes hue courtesy of the edible algae spirulina) got your wellness senses tingling, there’s another algae in town that’s vying for a “health food” title: chlorella.

So what is chlorella?

“Chlorella grows in freshwaters and is also commercially made and produced,” says Elizabeth Shaw, M.S., R.D.N. That means you can find it in various forms of consumption, such as powders, tablets, capsules and extracts.

Now you know that it’s another edible algae, but its nutrient makeup and the claims that it can help with a host of health issues is what’s bubbled it to the surface. “It’s emerging as a more widely recognized dietary supplement,” explains Jeffrey Bland, Ph.D., clinical biochemist, and founder of the Institute for Functional Medicine. Chlorella contains a wide variety of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and more, and it's been said to help with everything from blood sugar control to detoxification.

But there’s still much research to be done before science tells us for sure whether chlorella deserves a place in healthful diets, or if it's just dressed up in a health halo. “A majority of studies so far have been conducted on animals or have a very small human sample size, so we need to tread cautiously before making bold statements about chlorella’s ability to be a health food miracle,” Shaw adds. Also, the nutrient values often vary depending on the form of chlorella that you’re consuming.

These are some of the potential health benefits of chlorella.

Chlorella is packed with nutrients.

While the research on chlorella’s potential to positively impact specific aspects of health still has a ways to go, one thing we do know is that it’s a nutritional powerhouse, and that the ones it contains do confer benefits. Chlorella is a source of:

“Chlorella contains vitamin D and B12, which are two nutrients that aren’t found in many plant-derived foods,” says Shaw, and its higher folate and iron levels are also notable.

Chlorella may target free radicals.

Carotenoids are important antioxidants, and you may recognize them as the plant compounds that give fruits and vegetables their orange or yellow hues (in this case, chlorella’s chlorophyll content pushes its hue all the way green). The carotenoids in chlorella may help rid the body of free radicals, which left unchecked can do damage and lead to the development of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and cognitive conditions, Shaw says.

Chlorella may support immunity.

“We know vitamin D has a connection with strong immune health, and one study found that chlorella may have the potential to enhance immunity,” says Shaw, but more research is needed to determine which form and dose would be most beneficial. In general, vitamin D plays a role in regulating the immune system and has anti-inflammatory properties; keeping tabs on inflammation allows your immune system to function better.

Chlorella is a complete protein.

Not all protein sources are created equal — some are complete proteins, which contain all nine essential amino acids that our body can’t produce on its own, and (you guessed it!) incomplete proteins only have some of those amino acids.

Since chlorella is type of complete protein, it contains those amino acids that create the building blocks for bone, tissue, and muscle formation.

Chlorella may support eye health.

While there haven’t been specific studies conducted to explore chlorella and vision health, research shows that carotenoids, specifically lutein, may help improve age-related macular diseases or prevent their development in the first place — and chlorella is a source of these eye helpers, says Shaw.

Chlorella fights inflammation.

The vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and omega-3s that chlorella contains are known to have ant-inflammatory properties. Chronic inflammation can damage cells over time and is associated with the development of chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.

Chlorella may promote good heart health.

Clinical research on the potential impact of chlorella on heart health is needed , however the algae is a source of omega-3 fatty acids, which we know are part of a heart-healthy diet. Omega-3s are thought to support a healthy heart by decreasing levels of triglycerides (fats) in the blood, lowering blood pressure slightly, and taming inflammation.

Chlorella may contribute to healthy blood.

Chlorella contains three nutrients that are crucial for the formation of red blood cells: iron, folate and vitamin B12. Blood is what carries oxygen all throughout your body so that your organs, muscles and more can function as they should.

How to supplement with chlorella:

Even though more studies are needed to determine exactly how chlorella can support various aspects of good health, you may still want to consume it in order to enjoy all the vitamins and minerals it contains. “As with any supplements, I recommend talking with your doctor first to make sure it’s the right choice for you,” says Shaw, and for advice on dosage.

Chlorella powders can be added to smoothies, soups and even dips like guacamole or hummus. Whether choosing a supplement in powder, capsule, extract or tablet form, look for reputable companies that do third-party testing, says Shaw.

GasHubUnited Utility Officially Opens LNG Cylinder Bottling Plant In Jurong Island & Partners Spirulina Cultivator Spiral Energy To Achieve Carbon-Neutrality,"GEARING TOWARDS CARBON-NEUTRAL ENERGY

SINGAPORE, May 5, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Leading Singapore LNG distribution company, GasHubUnited Utility, is pleased to announce the official opening of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) cylinder bottling plant and distribution centre in Jurong Island, and an exciting partnership with Spiral Energy, Singapore's only cultivator of superfood spirulina.

LNG, the energy known to provide the best thermodynamic yields and therefore delivers the best energy efficiency, is also significantly more competitive in price than other energy sources. It releases 45-50% less CO2 than coal, 30% less CO2 than fuel oil, dramatically reduces nitrogen oxide emissions, does not emit soot, dust, or fumes, and produces insignificant amounts of sulfur dioxide, mercury, and other particulates compared to other fuels. Additionally, it is safe, non-toxic, leaves no ground or water residue, and does not harm aquatic life.

As the first in Singapore to bring LNG cylinder distribution to industrial and commercial users, GasHub is now on a quest to make LNG even more environmentally friendly.

GasHub, together with Spiral Energy, have developed an innovative solution to achieve carbon-neutrality while providing cleaner energy, by directing the CO2 from the combustion of LNG into the cultivation of spirulina, which is considered a first in the world.

While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, as high concentrations of carbon dioxide spur plant growth, CO2, unfortunately, remains the main culprit of global climate change.

""We are concerned that LNG, albeit its significantly lower emission of CO2, still impacts our environment,"" explained Mr Edward Loh, CEO of Spiral Energy, ""which got us thinking on how we can further lower the carbon output, or even put it to better use.""

""Hence, we came out with an innovative solution of turning this threat into a form of nutrients for plants,"" Mr Loh added, ""and we will be the first in the world to cultivate spirulina through the harnessing and usage of carbon emitted from the combustion of LNG.""

Story continues

Spirulina, an algae, is believed to be one of the oldest life forms on Earth and is considered a superfood, an all-in-one source of nutrients including protein levels comparable to eggs. Research shows that spirulina also boosts the production of white blood cells and antibodies that fight viruses and bacteria in your body, especially vital in a post-pandemic world. In addition, as Singapore heads towards its ""30 by 30"" food-resilience goal, spirulina is slated to play an undeniably important role in Singapore's food supply.

Since its establishment in 2017, GasHub has been actively developing cleaner and more efficient energy solutions using LNG. As the global demand for LNG grows due to the pressure to curb CO2 emission from other higher emission fossil fuel such as coal, fuel oil and diesel, GasHub continues to develop and provide cleaner, more environmentally friendly energy alternative to Singapore's burgeoning and robust manufacturing and commercial sectors.

Spirulina: Pharma’s Market Ally,"With more and more technological development in the fields of bio energy, pharmaceuticals and researchers of the nutrient world have been looking more into one particular microalgae: spirulina. Meticulous Research and the European Algae Biomass Association (EABA) recently launched a report at the end of June in which they concluded that the microalgae market is expected to reach USD $1.8 billion of worth by 2028. But what, exactly, are they looking into and why is it so promising?

Microalgae, or microphytes, are microscopic algae that are found in freshwater and in marine ecosystems. They vary in shape and size according to the species, ranging from micrometers to hundreds of micrometers. Microalgae has one main goal: to convert sunlight, CO2 and water into algae biomass. Spirulina is a natural, unbranched, filamentous blue-green algae, or cyanobacterium, that is high in protein. It’s packed with essential amino acids, iron, minerals, nutrients, carotenoids, and is a good source of antioxidants and B vitamins. These features justify why spirulina is often recommended to vegetarians and make it an ideal supplement during pregnancy, after surgery, or whenever the immune system needs a boost.

Although spirulina has been around since ancient times, its nutritional values and health benefits have not yet been scientifically proven. However, recent studies have shed a light on the microalgae’s health benefits and have developed technology to retrieve the best features of the cyanobacterium to complement and create holistic medicines. Studies by the Pukyong National University in the Republic of Korea have found that spirulina possess the ability to act upon several bioactivities, and has proven to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, anticancer, antiobesity, antidiabetic, antiviral, antibacterial, and anti hepatopathy properties. According to NB Entrepreneurs, leading manufacturers and producers of Excipient Solutions and top provider of pharmaceutical industry, it can “improve lipid and glucose metabolism, while also reducing liver fat and protecting the heart. Animal studies are very promising as well, as spirulina has been shown to be of similar potency as commonly used reference drugs, when it comes to neurological disorders. These effects also extend to arthritis and immunology”

The Meticulous Research and EABA’s report published a few weeks ago explain why, now of all times, spirulina and other microalgae are expected to grow in market size in the next 8 years. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, food and beverage manufacturers witnessed a decline in sales: with lockdowns in place throughout the world and government policy and recommendations to only buy the essentials, the F&B industry took a hit. With it, so did microalgae.

The decline in consumption of microalgae and algal biomass was because there were now many obstacles on the supply chain. From cultivation, to production, packaging and distribution, there were less employees at hand and less people to buy. China is one of the world’s leaders in consumption and production of microalgae. However, in 2020, “factory closures, microalgae processing facilities operating at reduced capacities, and restrictions on importing and exporting algae biomass strongly impacted the microalgae market”, according to the report. Moreover, the pandemic also affected the microalgae market in many countries around the world, like the US and India. With a nationwide lockdown in place in India, many commercial microalgae production and processing facilities shut down or are operating at reduced capacities, leading to substantial losses in domestic microalgal production.

However, the current pandemic has also acted as a big wakeup call to the world in regards to overall health, and the pharmaceutical industry has taken notice. A strong immune system has become a priority for many people, and a good nutrition intake is key in achieving that. The Meticulous Research and EABA’s report concluded that in order to maintain an optimal immune system, there is now a growing demand for plant and algae protein food products & beverages through e-commerce platforms. The Davis School of Medicine at the University of California, found that spirulina “inhibits influenza virus replication and reduces virus-induced mortality, and the addition of spirulina to cultured immune system cells significantly increased the production of infection-fighting cytokines” as well as that spirulina “modulates the production of cytokines and with its bioactive proteins stimulates the intestinal immune system to enhance the responsiveness to vaccines and improve allergic rhinitis due to its rich content of flavonoids and sulfalipids”

The report’s findings also concluded that the interest in microalgae, and spirulina in particular, has more chances to grow into the pharmaceutical industry. Health trends in 2021 showed a spike in interest towards natural food coloring, veganism and vegetarianism and unpleasantness towards processed foods, synthetic flavor and colors. Being a naturally bright and colorful superfood, spirulina has caught the eye and heart of consumers worldwide and is estimated to account for the largest share of the overall microalgae market in 2021 owing to the rising health & wellness trends and dietary supplements industry.",,[],[]

Go green: Meet the spirulina producer in France (who even sells soap),"Spirulina is a popular food supplement made from algae, which contains concentrated protein as well as vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. It is said to decrease inflammation, blood pressure and cholesterol, and protect against a multitude of diseases including cancer.

It can be sprinkled over food, incorporated into recipes or simply taken as a supplement. Hugo even sells soap made from mimosa and spirulina, and it can also be used in face masks to rejuvenate the skin although it is mainly used as a food supplement.

Mr Baudet grows his spirulina in large flat tanks inside greenhouses where it is sheltered from pollution and pesticides. When the spirulina is sufficiently concentrated, he strains the water through a very fine mesh and the resulting ‘green crème fraîche’ is pressed to remove around 70% of the water.

The form of spirulina takes six hours of dehydration to reach this size and look | Photo: Spiruline de Retz

It is then passed through an extruder which forms it into strings, like spaghetti. These are dehydrated very slowly for six hours, before being broken into small lengths by hand ready to be packaged. Everything is done on the farm.

“I was producing mussels, but I wanted to do something different,” he says. “I had already discovered spirulina and used it myself. I think it gives me a little more stamina and protects my general health. So I approached the Fédération des Spiruliniers de France and asked for information about setting up as a producer.”

He says that spirulina is especially useful for vegetarians and vegans as it contains a lot of protein, but that to preserve all its properties, it should be cooked. “It can be dissolved in apple juice or a smoothie, or sprinkled over yoghurt or added to salads. It makes everything go very bright green!”

He says people see best results when they take it daily. “It helps people recovering from surgery, illness or pregnancy, and some people take it during the change of the seasons. Sportspeople use it to reinforce their diets.”

During October it is possible to visit the farm and see how it’s made, and of course visit the farm shop on Fridays from 4-6pm. (Phone ahead.) The products are stocked locally, and can also be bought online.

Algae found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,"A recent study posted to Research Square* preprint server demonstrated that dry algal powders inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused adverse health impacts and economic crisis for two years now with no signs of relief yet. The latest global surge of COVID-19 infections has been ongoing since late 2021 due to the emergence of the highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.

Moreover, vaccine-breakthrough infections have been documented, and reports suggest an increase of breakthrough infections in the future. Over time, the continual emergence of novel variants and breakthrough cases emphasizes the development of newer antiviral drugs/therapies.

Several studies have reported phytochemicals from vascular plants in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication or other functional components. Further, some research groups observed antiviral properties of macro- and micro-algae against viruses such as herpes simplex virus, measles virus, and mumps virus, among others. In the context of COVID-19, one study reported the antiviral activity of some sulfated polysaccharides of algae against SARS-CoV-2.

The study

The current study assessed the antiviral properties of purified fucoidan from Sargassum spp and dried powders of Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina maxima. The dried algae were rehydrated with 1 ml of Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM). First, the cytotoxicity was evaluated by testing each sample at different concentrations (50, 70, and 100 µg/ml) in Vero cells. Microscopic observations determined the morphological changes due to treatment. An MTT assay estimated the cytotoxicity of samples at the concentration selected for further investigations.

Next, the algal antiviral activity and prophylactic potential were assessed. Two simultaneous and pre-treatment experiments were designed. In the concurrent design, Vero cells were treated with an algal sample and incubated with 50 or 100 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 )/ml for an hour at 37°C. In the second experiment, Vero cells were pre-treated with algal samples for 48 hours before incubating with SARS-CoV-2. Microscopic analyses were carried out to monitor viral cytopathic effect (CPE) or infection.

Findings

The researchers identified no detectable loss of confluence and cell vacuolization at 50 and 70 µg/ml under the microscope, but some modifications were evident in the cell monolayer at 100 µg/ml. MTT assays demonstrated 78.1% cell viability with fucoidan and 76% and 67.5% for Spirulina and Chlorella samples. CPE was not observed with Chlorella in both experiments. Similarly, no CPE was observed in both experiments with Spirulina samples at 50 TCID 50 /ml of SARS-CoV-2. Still, at the increased concentration (100 TCID 50 /ml), CPE was observed in 75% of replicates for the simultaneous experiment, and 50% replicates in the pre-treated experiment. CPE was detected with fucoidan treatment in both experiments in 37.5% replicates at 50 TCID 50 /ml of SARS-CoV-2, and the results were similar to treatment with Spirulina samples at the increased viral concentration.

The research group repeated the earlier experiments using 4% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and DMEM to investigate whether the bioavailability of algal samples improved. At 50 TCID 50 /ml, all three algal samples showed no CPE in both experiments. Moreover, the Spirulina samples at 100 TCID 50 /ml SARS-CoV-2 reduced CPE to 12.5% and 25% in pretreated and simultaneous assays. Surprisingly, CPE increased in both experiments with fucoidan treatment.

Next, they quantified SARS-CoV-2 genomic copies with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In pre-treated and simultaneous assays, the most potent antiviral activity was observed among cells with Chlorella treatment. After 96 hours of infection, the peak inhibitory effect showed a 1000-fold reduction in viral load relative to controls. While Spirulina treatment showed potent inhibition in the simultaneous experiment, protection was partial in pre-treated cells. The highest inhibitory effect with Spirulina samples was observed at 72 hours post-infection. A 10-fold reduction was observed at 72 hours in the simultaneous assay with fucoidan treatment; although the viral load was lower in the pre-treatment assay, it was statistically insignificant.

Conclusions

The findings of the study showed the antiviral potential of algae against SARS-CoV-2. Chlorella vulgaris exhibited the highest antiviral potential across all algal samples, assays, and virus concentrations. Of the three algal samples, the use of fucoidan did result in antiviral activity but at a lower potency. When fucoidan was used with DMSO, the infection rate (CPE) increased, indicating that its bioavailability was better in aqueous solvents (DMEM) given that it is a water-soluble polysaccharide.

Altogether, these results showed that Chlorella and Spirulina were potent in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2, suggesting their potential applicability in COVID-19 treatment. Nonetheless, further pre-clinical and clinical studies are required to confirm these findings.

How to boost your immune system to fight winter colds with this special ingredient,"Promotion

Add spirulina into your morning smoothie to start your day off right. - Credit: Archant

Do you feel like your immune system’s been down lately?

No, you’re not the only one getting ill at the moment, and yes, this cold definitely does feel worse than ones we’ve had before.

Here to introduce you to an ingredient that’s been used to fight viruses and flus, Michael Drane, director of Pure Foods Fresh in Norfolk, shares how spirulina can get your body fighting off these pesky winter colds in no time.

Below, he also shares some quick and easy recipes for integrating spirulina into your daily diet.

Q: What is spirulina and what nutrients does it provide?

Spirulina is a type of nutrient-dense algae that’s high in protein and derived from natural freshwater sources like lakes and rivers. Although, these areas also harbour some viruses and bacteria. “To avoid this, we grow our spirulina in specially designed pools and use filtered mineral water to keep this superfood fit for human consumption,” Michael says. “This makes our spirulina the most powerful and only natural source of its kind you can buy on the market today.”

“74 per cent of the spirulina we sell is wholly made up of protein, delivering 18 out of the 20 amino acids which help cell regrowth and are required for the body to function properly,” Michael tells us. “It actually contains three times more protein than meat, making it far easier to feed your body and give it what it needs.

“Your body needs wholesome nutrients, not just supplement powders and tablets, but real food, and that’s what spirulina is,” he explains. The immune-boosting ingredient has 24 times more vitamin E than strawberries, 10 times more calcium than milk, three times more iron than spinach and four times more potassium than in bananas.

“It’s a simple and effective way to care for your body whilst maintaining a healthy and balanced diet,” Michael adds.

Q: How will spirulina help me to build my immune system and fight off infection?

“We’ve all heard the saying ‘we are what we eat’, right? Well, our immune systems aren’t any different,” Michael says. “The food we consume contributes massively to our bodies’ immunity and its ability to fight illness or remove toxins from the body.”

Michael explains how our immune systems rely on antioxidants (substances within the body that repair, protect and prevent damage to other cells) in order to remain healthy. Spirulina has been heavily researched by scientist Baruch Dach in its ability to boost antioxidants and increase the number of key cells that possess immune-enhancing properties.

“This significantly improves your body’s ability to fight infection even when it’s under stress from harmful toxins and infections,” he says.

Spirulina is packed with essential antioxidants vitamin E and vitamin C, which can reduce the duration and symptoms of illness. The abundance of iron will improve blood flow of oxygen around the body to aid the immune system, and the selenium and zinc in spirulina have anti-viral properties that can fight infection quicker and more effectively.

Q: How can I introduce spirulina into my everyday diet and lifestyle?

“It really couldn’t be easier,” Michael says. “A good immunity is built on consistency, balance and preparation, so you’ll benefit most from consuming it every day. If you don’t have much time, just grab your fresh spirulina from the freezer and eat it straight from the pot – it's delicious.”

Spirulina is filled with wholesome nutrients like Vitamin C and E to give your health a boost. - Credit: Archant

If you are feeling a little more creative, however, try experimenting with some easy recipes:

Cereal - Add it to your muesli (or any cereal you like) by mixing the spirulina into some yoghurt to form a smooth, creamy and healthy way to kickstart your day.

Smoothie – Add your spirulina into a blender with some water or milk, fruit (pineapple, banana, orange and mango work best), spinach and chai seeds to create a yummy smoothie that you can enjoy on your morning commute.

Pancakes - Make your usual pancake mix, add the spirulina, leave it for an hour and you’re good to go.

Guacamole dip – Smash your avocado, add the spirulina, lime juice, tomato and onion with some salt and pepper for a tasty topping on your tortilla chips.

Pesto – Grind your spirulina with basil, garlic, cheese and nuts, then mix with olive oil for a simple but delectable addition to pizza, pasta, couscous or bread.





If you want to fight the flu, boost your immune system and give your body the nutrients it’s craving, give spirulina a go.

4 Types of Edible Algae With Superfood Potential,"The first thing that comes to mind when you think of algae might be pond scum or that greenish stuff that collects on the surface of underused pools. But did you know there are several other types of algae that aren't just edible, but healthy, too?

You may be familiar with eating seaweed already, thanks to delicious menu items like nori-wrapped sushi—but the world of edible algae extends well beyond your favorite spicy tuna roll to include varieties like chlorella, spirulina, and sea moss. These microplants are rich in nutrients and are thought to provide a host of health benefits when consumed.

""Algae is very efficient at synthesizing and making bioactive compounds,"" says Ralph Esposito, ND, LAc, naturopathic physician, functional medicine practitioner, and acupuncturist specializing in integrative urology, endocrinology, and nutrigenomics (the study of how food/nutrition impacts your genes). In layman's terms, this means that algae can take in sunlight and nutrients from the environment and transform them into nutrients and compounds our bodies can use. ""This includes things like omega-3 fatty acids, iron, vitamin K, zinc, magnesium, and, interestingly, it can make methylated (active) forms of B vitamins like B12 and folate,"" Esposito explains.

What to Look for in an Algae Product

It's not recommended to harvest your own algae for consumption, since many types can be toxic. While most edible algae is found in dietary supplement form (although certain seaweeds can be found in their raw form), Esposito cautions not to take any supplement blindly, and to look for algae products that come from clean waters without any metals, contaminants, or other environmental pollutants.

""Some things to look for are NSF certification and third-party testing,"" he says. ""Remember, a company can get a third party to test their product but it doesn't mean they always pass. NSF certification confirms they are tested and they pass.""

Most importantly, always consult your doctor before starting any new supplement, and remember that eating whole, healthy foods and a balanced diet is the best way to fuel your body, rather than relying on supplements.

Healthy Types of Edible Algae—and Their Nutritional Benefits

There are many different types of algae you can eat, each with its own unique set of characteristics and health properties. Here are four varieties to know about, and why they're supposedly so good for you.",,[],"['Laura Fisher', 'March']"
Supplementation With Spirulina Reduces Infarct Size and Ameliorates Cardiac Function in a Pig Model of STEMI,"This article was originally published here

Front Pharmacol. 2022 May 3;13:891801. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2022.891801. eCollection 2022.

ABSTRACT

Background and Aims: Myocardial infarction (MI) is the clinical manifestation of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Spirulina is an algae known to ameliorate cardiometabolic disorders and with proven anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. We investigated, in a highly translatable animal model, whether oral supplementation with spirulina protects against the deleterious effects triggered by ST-elevation MI (STEMI). Methods: Pigs were fed a regular diet supplemented with spirulina (1 g/animal/bid) or placebo-control for 10 days. Thereafter, animals were subjected to 1.5 h percutaneous balloon-induced coronary occlusion (STEMI) followed by 2.5 h reperfusion and then sacrificed. We assessed infarct size and cardiac function. Blood samples and infarcted and remote myocardial tissue were obtained. Results: Spirulina supplementation reduced infarct size by 64%, increased myocardial salvage by 18%, and improved cardiac function by 30% vs. controls (p < 0.05). These benefits were associated with attenuation in DNA-oxidative damage and apoptotic markers and increased iNOS in the infarcted myocardium, higher AMPK activation in the remote myocardium, and lower myocardial MCP-1 expression. Systemically, spirulina attenuated Cox-2 expression in STEMI-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and enhanced TNF-α release acutely post-STEMI. Additionally, spirulina decreased weight gain progression over time (p < 0.05) without changes in lipids, glucose, liver or kidney parameters. Conclusion: A 10-day supplementation with spirulina exerts cardioprotection in a preclinical setting of STEMI by limiting cardiac damage and improving ventricular contractility through anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms.

"11 Best Greens Powders of 2022, According to a Nutritionist","When it comes to green beverages, you might think of a soothing cup of matcha tea or even a sugar-packed Shamrock shake. But a different kind of green drink is suddenly everywhere — vitamin-packed health blends made from greens powders that promise to provide you with your veggies for the day, without having to eat a single bite of broccoli.

“Since the onset of COVID, people are becoming more aware of their health and looking for different ways to improve their diet,” says Amy K. Fischer, RDN, a dietitian with the Good Housekeeping Institute, who says social media and celebrity endorsements are also driving the greens-powder trend.

Before you mix up a Kermit-colored smoothie, keep in mind that the best way to get the nutrients you need is by eating a variety of foods in their natural — not powdered — form. “Whole vegetables contain fiber and water, which can help keep you feel fuller longer, aid in digestion and helps to build better gut bacteria — and you can see what you are eating, so there’s no guesswork involved,” Fischer says.

However, the CDC reports that just 9% of American adults get the recommended 1.5 cups of fruit and 2-3 cups of vegetables each day. So if you’re the type of person who is just never going to bring yourself to eat a kale salad or a side of Brussels sprouts, greens powders can be a decent substitute, Fischer says.

Note that almost all the greens powders start with a blend of spirulina and chlorella (two nutrient-packed types of algae), plus antioxidant-rich wheatgrass; after that, they may include anything from a handful of others greens to hundreds more ingredients, including probiotics, adaptogens and traditional Chinese herbs.

"From Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Deepika Padukone to Virat Kohli, these celebs have invested in startups","India has the third-largest startup ecosystem with 100 unicorns, with angel investors, venture capital firms, HNI’s (high net-worth individuals), and industrialists actively investing in these rising startups.

Ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of ‘Make in India’, the country’s startup ecosystem has found support from around the world. This includes large corporations that have boosted foreign direct investment (FDI) in the nation.

B-Town celebrities and cricketers have also joined the club in the past few years and ventured into the Indian startup ecosystem. Apart from being brand ambassadors, these celebrities have started betting on startups in various sectors, and some of them have turned from investors to entrepreneurs.

Here is a list of celebrities who have invested in diverse fields like femtech, nutrition, and sports, and are being a part of India’s growth story:

Doughnuts and hot chocolate drinks for your canine companion? You're doggone right,"Party animal Nixie samples one of the wares from The Barkuterie Box.

If you have ever fantasised about hosting a party for the family dog and all of his or her canine buddies from around the neighbourhood, with cupcakes and ice cream on the menu, now you can.

It sounds like something from the most whimsical of children’s books, but this fanciful scenario has become an entrepreneurial reality for Hamilton woman Alyssa Bradly​ and her mother Gretchen Binns.​

The pair run a bakery service out of their home in Flagstaff called Fairybread & Marshmallow which specialises in catering for kids’ birthday parties, well-prepared “grazing boxes” for snacking throughout the working day, and catering for corporate functions and other events.

These consumable treats are not made with dogs in mind. But one day the thought occurred to Binns: What if they were?

“My mum has crazy ideas all the time,” reveals Bradly. “She was taking our dogs for a walk one day when she came up with the idea of having grazing boxes for dogs. Well, why not?”

And what at first appeared to be a quirky side venture is now taking off, with displays and stalls such as one held at a community fair at Fraser High School on Sunday inspiring lots of positive feedback – and not just from the dogs.

“It’s like a whole new world we have discovered. Lots of people think of treats like doughnuts and cupcakes as being just for humans. But of course they don’t have to be.”

Christel Yardley/Stuff The Barkuterie Box co-owner Alyssa Bradly and her mother Gretchen Binns have devised an entire smorgasbord of canine-friendly treats.

The treats they make under the label The Barkuterie Box feature secret ingredients such as peanut butter and carrots – winning attributes for the most discerning canine connoisseurs or puppy palates.

The family’s pair of schnauzers, Reggie and Pippy, are the very willing taste testers for each new innovation.

“Some dogs are probably a little fussier. But dogs are just like people, really. Everyone is different.

“A lot of people who come up and see what we are selling don’t realise at first that this selection is especially made for dogs. They say ‘I wish I had a dog, so I could throw them a doughnut party’, or something like that.”

Christel Yardley/Stuff The snacks created by the mother-daughter team at The Barkuterie Box look like they should not be part of the daily dietary intake for dogs - but they are.

But wait – isn’t chocolate and sugar an inherently unhealthy food choice for our four-legged friends? Of course, says Bradly. That’s why their doggie baking selection and drinks does not contain any great amount of sugar or natural chocolate.

“There is icing on the doughnuts, but it is icing without any sugar in it. It is a paste that mixes cornstarch with natural yoghurt. To give the icing different colourings we mix in raspberry starch or spirulina powder, things like that.”

The ice creams and hot chocolate drinks for dogs are sourced from a South Island company called Scoop Dog. The chocolate is made from carob powder and goats’ milk, which is not harmful to dogs.

Christel Yardley/Stuff For most people, feeding a dog an entire freshly-baked doughnut would be a crime. These doughnuts, however, are made with dogs in mind.

The ice cream comes in dog-specific flavours such as bacon, banana and carob chocolate.

“Everything we bake is made with human grade, natural ingredients – so if the humans want to eat the dog treats themselves, they can.”

Whether the dogs have any objection to their humans wolfing down their specially-made treats, however, could be another story.",,[],['Mike Mather']
"Impact of Spirulina Chikki Supplementation on Nutritional Status of Children: An Intervention Study in Tumkur District of Karnataka, India","This article was originally published here

Front Pediatr. 2022 Apr 15;10:860789. doi: 10.3389/fped.2022.860789. eCollection 2022.

ABSTRACT

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of Spirulina Chikki supplementation on the nutritional status of children (6 months-6 years).

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design was adopted to assess the changes in nutritional status among the children (after 12 months of intervention period). The bassline and endline assessment were carried out from September 2020 to August 2021, respectively.

SETTING: Total 106 villages (108 Anganwadi Centers in nine circles) from Tumkur District were covered.

METHODS: Children aged 6 months-6 years were the study subjects. Anthropometric measurements viz., height, weight, and mid-arm circumference were collected from total 971 and 838 children during baseline and endline assessments correspondingly. The information on children’s health and nutrition status was gathered from the mothers of sampled children. WHO’s Anthro and AnthroPlus software were utilized to estimate the anthropometric measurements (Stunting, wasting, and underweight) of study participants.

RESULTS: The study found apparent disparities in the prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight among the male and female children. There was a significant decline viz., 4% (28.6%-baseline to 24.5%-end line) in the prevalence of severe wasting. Also, severe stunting dropped by 6% at end line (30%-end-line to 24%-baseline). Improvement in nutritional status was evident among both female male children in all three indicators stunting, wasting, and underweight. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measurement shows substantial improvements from baseline to end line: SAM (5.3-0.6%), MAM (23-9%), and normal (72-91%). The study discloses significant improvements in the nutritional status among those children who consumed spirulina chikkis/granules for a longer duration viz., 9-10 months as compared to those who consumed for lesser duration.

CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal improvement in nutritional status among the beneficiaries who consumed spirulina chikki/granules as per the recommended quantity (amount) during the intervention period. Post intervention, spirulina chikki supplementation for nutritional intervention is implied to address large scale malnutrition among young children.

Bonnysa launches its guacamole with spirulina to the market,"According to the data observed in the markets after COVID-19 hit the world, the primary value consumers uphold when choosing the products they buy is that they are 100% fresh and natural. Faced with other options, they will opt for products that add value to their consumption. In this sense, the product's flavor is always the main differentiating factor.

With this in mind, Bonnysa began to work on developing a new line of products aimed at this new market trend and incorporated a new recipe that includes spirulina to its guacamole product line. The new product brings together the flavor of fresh guacamole and the nutritional properties of spirulina under the 'enjoy taking care of yourself' concept.

Spirulina is a seaweed that contains numerous nutritional properties. It is an excellent source of vitamins, minerals, proteins, and natural antioxidants. It is considered a superfood and recent studies indicate that it helps the body regulate cholesterol and sugar levels. In addition, it can also have a beneficial effect on the heart and the immune system, and it is an exceptional prebiotic.

Bonnysa's guacamole range is made up of the original fresh guacamole, the recipe by chef Gabriel Hernández, the 99% avocado spread, and the Vita + guacamole with spirulina product. Bonnysa is one of the companies with the widest range of guacamole in the European Union.

The product will be available at Fruit Attraction, at Bonnysa's stand (Hall 3, Stand 3D01).

"Blue Smoothie on TikTok: A Cheaper, Healthier Twist","Would you pay $17 for a smoothie? Most people wouldn’t! But that’s just what thousands of people did recently to try TikTok’s hottest smoothie, a recipe that, via the hashtag #bluesmoothie, has racked up 17.5 million views and counting.

Erewhon is the upscale grocery store in Los Angeles that’s selling the drink, which is called “Marianna’s Coconut Cloud Smoothie.” Created with influencer Marianna Hewitt, it features her brand of almond milk as a main ingredient — but that’s not what made this social media’s most famous smoothie. This stunningly beautiful bright-blue smoothie gets its hue naturally from blue spirulina, a type of algae.

The idea of consuming algae may sound odd, but past research suggests it could have anti-inflammatory effects in the body and decrease the risk of developing chronic conditions such as heart disease. Not to mention, spirulina is tasteless.

While the captivating color of the aforementioned viral smoothie may draw you in, you may find the texture is what hooks you. Those people who have tried the drink describe its mouthfeel as light and fluffy. No wonder “cloud” features in its name.

But this smoothie isn’t perfect — aside from its hefty price tag, its nutritional profile isn’t exactly sterling.

Although nutrition information for the Coconut Cloud Smoothie isn’t readily available online, that it contains coconut cream means it’s high in saturated fat, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The American Heart Association suggests limiting intake to no more than 6 percent of your daily calories — or about 13 grams (g) if you’re consuming 2,000 calories per day.

The original recipe also calls for collagen powder, which is part of what makes the original version so pricey. (A quick search on Amazon yields results for collagen powders that range from roughly $12 to $50 per container.) Collagen is a protein and the main component of connective tissues and the skin, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. While it might stand to reason that eating collagen would increase the collagen in your body (thereby making skin look more radiant), the article goes on to point out that there is not enough evidence to support that theory. Indeed, the author states that collagen cannot be absorbed whole by the human body, so it has to be broken down during digestion. These “collagen pieces” are then absorbed by the body and can be used for whatever purpose the body deems most critical — not necessarily to make collagen at all.

Rather than consuming collagen directly, ramping up your intake of nutrients that support collagen production in the body — more specifically vitamin C and zinc — can be helpful, per Harvard. The pineapple in the original recipe is an excellent source of vitamin C, with 78.9 mg per 1-cup serving, notes the USDA.

Even with that nutritional pro of the original beverage, there’s a smarter way to enjoy the trendy food.

A Healthier (and Cheaper) Blue Smoothie

In this twist on the viral blue smoothie, there’s a small amount of light coconut milk to replace the coconut cream and significantly lower the amount of saturated fat. Also incorporated is mango for an extra boost of the collagen-supporting vitamin, bringing the total amount in this smoothie to more than you need in a day, according to the National Institutes of Health. You’ll find zinc in the almond butter, too, per the USDA.

Another plus of this version: It’s about $5 per serving, after you pay the upfront costs of stocking your kitchen with these ingredients.

Here’s how to whip it up:

Ingredients

¼ cup light coconut milk

½ cup unsweetened soy milk (plus more as needed)

½ large ripe banana, frozen

1 cup frozen pineapple chunks

½ cup frozen mango chunks

½ ripe avocado

1 g blue spirulina (algae powder), plus a dusting for the glass

1 tbsp unsweetened almond butter

1 tbsp chia seeds (optional)

Directions

Place all of the ingredients into a blender and blend on high until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Add more soy milk as needed to adjust the thickness of the smoothie. If you wish to create the ombre effect, place a small amount of the blue spirulina on the bottom of the glass before pouring the smoothie in.
