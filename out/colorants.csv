Key growth drivers of the market:

Owing to pollution and increasing amount of work stress, Indians are facing serious hair-related problems. Therefore to nourish their hair, besides using primary hair care products like hair oils, shampoos, and conditioners, consumers are demanding hair care products like hair serums, hair nourishing oils, nourshing shampoo, and hair protectants, which is driving the growth of the market.

Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have exposed Indians to global hair care trends. Influenced by celebrities, people are increasingly investing in hair styling products like hair wax and hair gel, besides coloring, straightening or perming of the hair. This, as a result, is facilitating the growth of the hair care products market in India.

Key deterrents to the growth of the market:

The hair care products market in India consists of players who do not adhere to the quality standards for the products and services they offer. Also, counterfeit hair care products are available at a lower price than the original ones, thereby attracting price-sensitive Indian consumers. However, fake products fail to live up to the expectations of consumers in terms of quality, hampering their loyalty to the original branded products. Consumer also tend to switch brands if similar products are available at affordable prices. Allergic reactions to certain chemicals, ineffectiveness of a product and lack of availability are among other reasons that might impel Indians to switch brands. These factors hinder the growth of the market players which poses challenge towards the expansion of the market.

Achieving More with Priming and Coating,"Commentary & Analysis

If priming and coating are each important to the success of inkjet in commercial printing, both are crucial for inkjet printing in the label and packaging segments. In this article, sponsored by Michelman, Inc., and based on a just-released white paper, European section editor Ralf Schlözer explains how folding carton and corrugated packaging markets are expanding for inkjet in large part due to the application of these fluids.

The most quickly-evolving printing technology coming to the production printing market is inkjet and growth rates in recent years have been dramatic. Inkjet addresses some of the core needs of today’s businesses: smaller runs or batches, just-in-time production, customization, and streamlining of processes.

Inkjet presses have been launched for many applications so far and more are expected. Press manufacturers take great care to design printers that can produce excellent prints. Unfortunately, only press components like inkjet heads, inks, and drying can be well-defined by the press manufacturer. The production and selection of the printing substrate are not. Substrates may be specified by the printing company or the print buyer. They keep changing, either voluntarily or involuntarily, due to paper shortages or batch-to-batch variations from the mill. In any case, a given substrate might not be very receptive to inkjet inks.

A primer can help to overcome receptivity and inconsistency problems by preparing the substrate surface. For porous substrates, a primer keeps the ink, specifically the colorants, on the surface while the carrier fluid soaks into the bulk of the substrate. This is achieved by chemically binding the pigments to the chemicals in the primer layer. On non-porous substrates, the primer creates a surface that holds the colorants in place before the solvent can spread or coalesce.

While a primer can be a necessity for good print quality, an overprint varnish can either embellish a product, by giving it a distinct gloss level, or protect the surface. A varnish can be formulated to be sturdier than an inkjet image, as it does not have the restrictions of being able to hold colorants or to pass through ultra-fine nozzles. It can protect the print from damage in finishing, transport or from sunlight.

In commercial print, the advantages of priming and coating for inkjet printers are already well documented, but probably still not well-known enough. A primer is used to keep the colorants at the surface to achieve good color strength and reduce the amount of ink. Compatibility with standard offset coated paper is especially critical and does not generally receive inkjet ink well without being treated.

If priming and coating are each important in commercial printing, both are crucial for quality inkjet printing in labels and packaging segments. While in commercial printing, the paper is usually selected based on appearance and price, substrates in packaging print have another function to fulfil: to safely hold and transport products. Finishing, assembly, and transport can be quite detrimental to durability of the print image. The required surfaces for the various packaging segments may be challenging to print on as well.

Folding carton is a prime example of a packaging application where every container needs to look alike and pristine on the shelf. Product manufacturers want the same image, brand colors, and level of gloss on their packaging, however it is produced. Matched priming and coating are key ingredients in achieving consistency. As substrates are optimized for usage as a sealed packaging material, they are made more difficult to print on in general.

This is particularly true of substrates for corrugated boxes and displays. Surfaces for corrugated materials are usually very absorbent and would require large amounts of ink to achieve a decent color strength, while low-grade fibers or recycled materials cause unevenness. The use of optimized primers for the multiple substrates used has made the corrugated box market one of the latest, and biggest success stories in inkjet adoption.

In label printing, inkjet is already well established. As inkjet is increasingly moving from secondary to primary labels, requirements in quality and durability increase. A primer can improve both, especially when moving to aqueous inkjet. Even UV inks benefit when the primer stops the ink from soaking into the bulk of the substrate, thus preventing curing problems and unwanted odor from uncured ink.

Inkjet press providers for flexible packaging already made the move to aqueous inks, due to the many food products in flexible packaging. However, without a primer making inkjet inks adhere well to flexible packaging material, this would be very challenging.

Customers, design, and distribution requirements are getting more demanding. Priming and coating make fulfilling the application requirements in many print segments much easier. However, it is by no means an easy task to design a good primer or coating. A good primer or coating should not be judged by the price of the liter either, but by the print quality achieved, the improved efficiency, the reduced inventory and waste, and the flexibility added to the whole print manufacturing process. Even for cost-sensitive projects, it pays to investigate how a primer or coating can improve results—considering the diverse requirements in the many application areas for print

The advantage of seed coating method is that the quality of the seed is not at all affected by external factors like fungus, parasites, high temperatures, transportation wear and tear, mechanical damage, pathogens etc. thus, helping the germination process and improving the longevity and quality of the seed. This added layer of protection enhances crop yield, and that is why it's preferred by farmers, especially in the developing countries with huge population. The technique is also safer for the environment as the use of insecticides and pesticides are limited, reducing the soil and water pollution. There has been a shortage of arable land from the past years, which has created a gap in the demand and supply of agriculture produce. The only solution is to increase the yield of crops which can be done with the help of methods like seed coating. It helps in accelerating the performance and germination of seeds.

"What Is Blue Tea, and How Do You Make It?","This article reviews blue tea, including its benefits, downsides, and how to prepare it.

Aside from being a natural food colorant, blue tea is widely consumed for its medicinal properties. For instance, it reportedly improves heart and brain health and provides anti-diabetic and anti-cancer effects ( 1 ).

It’s made by brewing the dry petals of Clitoria ternatea L., a plant known for its characteristic bright blue color.

Blue tea — also known as butterfly pea or blue pea tea — is an herbal infusion native to South Asia.

Blue tea is an herbal infusion made from butterfly pea flowers, which are rich in anthocyanins. Anthocyanins give the tea its bright blue color and medicinal properties.

It’s also worth noting that butterfly pea flowers are used as a natural food dye and as ornamental flowers worldwide ( 4 ).

Aside from giving the tea its distinctive blue color, anthocyanins are also responsible for its touted medicinal properties. In fact, that’s why it’s long been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat multiple ailments ( 1 , 4 ).

Once brewed, the tea may change color to red, violet, or green, depending on its pH or acidity level. You can modify this by adding tonic water, lemon, or lime ( 2 , 3 ).

Butterfly pea flowers range from white to intense blue. The blue color is due to their high content of anthocyanins — antioxidant pigments also found in other blue and purple fruits and vegetables.

Blue tea is an herbal infusion made with the dry petals of Clitoria ternatea L., commonly known as Butterfly pea. The infusion is often flavored with ingredients like mint, ginger, lemongrass, or cinnamon

Here are some of the most popular and evidence-based benefits of drinking blue tea.

Rich in antioxidants

Antioxidants are beneficial compounds that scavenge molecules known as free radicals. Too many free radicals in your body can lead to oxidative stress, which can promote the onset of certain diseases ( 3 , 5 ).

As mentioned, butterfly pea flowers are rich in anthocyanins — namely delphinidin, which is largely responsible for the deep blue to purple color ( 3 , 6 ).

Anthocyanins are a group of antioxidants. They’re present in edible fruits, vegetables, and flowers and provide beneficial effects against diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer ( 6 ).

Evidence also suggests that delphinidin protects against lipid peroxidation — a process that damages cell membranes, promotes aging, and causes the formation of a carcinogenic compound called malondialdehyde (MDA) ( 7 , 8 ).

Further, a small study in 16 men who were overweight or obese found that taking butterfly pea flower extract after a high fat meal helped maintain high levels of Glutathione peroxidase (Gpx). Gpx is an antioxidant enzyme that helps reduce lipid peroxidation ( 8 ).

Promotes heart health

Drinking blue tea may boost your heart health by improving blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

Animal studies suggest that butterfly pea flower extract may lower blood pressure through its vasorelaxation properties — meaning that it helps widen your blood vessels to enhance blood flow ( 7 , 9 ).

In addition, it boasts antithrombotic effects. This means it may prevent the formation of blood clots, a risk factor for stroke ( 7 ).

The previously mentioned small study in 16 men with overweight or obesity further found that taking butterfly pea extract after a high fat meal reduced the formation of fat cells and the accumulation of triglycerides ( 8 ).

This means the extract may improve unusually high concentrations of blood lipids after a meal — a predictor of heart disease ( 8 ).

To explain this effect, researchers speculate that the flower’s antioxidants inhibit pancreatic lipase, an enzyme in charge of breaking down dietary fats ( 8 ).

May have anti-diabetes properties

Anthocyanins in blue tea may help manage your blood sugar levels.

Some research shows that antioxidants in butterfly pea extract may inhibit carb-digesting enzymes like intestinal alpha-glucosidase, pancreatic alpha-amylase, and intestinal sucrase ( 1 , 3 ).

By inhibiting said enzymes, the extract delays the digestion and absorption of sugars. In return, this results in reduced blood sugar and insulin levels ( 1 , 3 ).

Reduced blood insulin levels have been associated with a lower risk of insulin resistance, blood vessel dysfunction, obesity, and metabolic syndrome ( 1 ).

However, human research still has conflicting findings when analyzing the anti-diabetic properties of blue tea.

A study in 15 healthy adults determined that consuming sucrose — or table sugar — with 1 or 2 grams of butterfly pea extract led to suppressed insulin and blood sugar levels 30 minutes later, suggesting improved blood sugar management after a meal ( 1 ).

In contrast, the small study in 16 men with overweight or obesity found no significant differences in blood sugar levels after a high fat meal supplemented with the same amount of butterfly pea extract ( 8 ).

Additionally, note that human studies use the flower’s extract and not the tea. Seeing as tea is much more diluted, it’s unlikely to have the same notable effects.

Other benefits

Other potential benefits of drinking blue tea include:

Anti-fungal and antimicrobial properties. Certain antioxidants found in the flower may offer anti-fungal properties against Penicillium expansum conidia and antibacterial properties against Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus ( 2 , 3 , 7 , 10, 11).

Certain antioxidants found in the flower may offer anti-fungal properties against Penicillium expansum conidia and antibacterial properties against Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus ( , , , 10, 11). Improved brain health. Animal studies suggest that butterfly pea extract may improve memory and prevent further memory loss in Alzheimer’s Disease, though no research confirms these effects in humans ( 2 , 12 ).

Animal studies suggest that butterfly pea extract may improve memory and prevent further memory loss in Alzheimer’s Disease, though no research confirms these effects in humans ( , ). Caffeine-free alternative. Since blue tea is made from butterfly pea flowers and not the Camellia sinensis plant — the source of caffeine in black tea — it’s a caffeine-free beverage ( 13 ).

Since blue tea is made from butterfly pea flowers and not the Camellia sinensis plant — the source of caffeine in black tea — it’s a caffeine-free beverage ( ). Natural food colorant. The blue color of butterfly pea flowers is a popular alternative to artificial blue food colorants, which have become increasingly disfavored due to health concerns ( 2 ).

While research on blue tea’s benefits is promising, most of it focuses on extracts and antioxidants rather than brewed tea. In addition, there is an evident lack of human studies, as most of the research is related to findings from test-tube and animal studies.

Thus, further human research is needed to better understand the beneficial effects of drinking a cup of this tea.",,[],"['Ariane Lang', 'Bsc']"

Massimo Iorizzo, Ph.D., a North Carolina State University associate professor of plant genomics, was awarded a $637,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA) to increase anthocyanin yield in purple carrots and to improve anthocyanin longevity in food products.



Washed Purple Elite carrots.

The U.S. is the largest consumer and producer of natural food colorants. However, the use of anthocyanins, a pigment found in red, blue, and purple plant tissues, can be challenging due to varying yield, difficulty in color-matching a desired hue and concerns with color fastness for shelf life. There are more than 600 identified anthocyanins, some with more desirable traits for use as a food colorant than others.

One particularly promising source of anthocyanins for food colorants are purple carrots, due to their accumulation of large quantities of more-stable anthocyanin compounds. Most fresh market carrots available to consumers in the United States are orange; however, carrots that are red, yellow or purple are becoming more frequently available in fresh, frozen and juice products.



Carrot field at NC's Mountain Research Station

For the past five years, NC State has been involved in research originating and coordinated by the North Carolina Biotechnology Center and funded by the NC Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services New and Emerging Crops Program, investigating the feasibility of growing purple carrot varieties in different soil types, climates and growing seasons across North Carolina. According to Hunter Barrier, new and emerging crops program coordinator, ""This research demonstrated that high-quality purple carrots can grow in North Carolina. Research continues to address production challenges and develop agronomic production recommendations for growing carrots in N.C.""

Additional potential

There may be additional market potential for purple carrots. According to Paul Ulanch, Ph.D., executive director of NCBiotech’s Crop Commercialization Program, “Additional agribusinesses have expressed interest in the purple carrot trials for potential expansion of production for fresh-market carrots, juices, purees, and dried flours.”

In addition to assessing the agronomic and economic crop potential, postharvest carrot data collection included anthocyanin identification and quantification in collaboration with the NC Food Innovation Lab.

Iorizzo explains, “This grant will allow us to utilize genotyping and phenotyping to select carrot cultivars that can maximize anthocyanin yield and stability. Improving the purple carrot with anthocyanin extraction in mind is an important step in establishing it as a viable crop for our farmers and for the food ingredient market.”

There are no official statistics of worldwide purple carrot production, but the food industry estimates an annual need of 20 million pounds of carrot-derived anthocyanins to meet the growing demand. For comparison, according to the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, the U.S. produced 3.4 billion pounds of fresh-market carrots in 2020 valued at $10,600 per acre.

This project will be led by Iorizzo at the university’s Plants for Human Health Institute, at the North Carolina Research Campus in Kannapolis. Iorizzo led the publication of the carrot genome and he is now focusing his research on nutritional and quality trait improvement of blueberry and carrot using advanced genomic tools. Food scientist Mario Ferruzzi, Ph.D., director of the Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Center, is a collaborator on the project and will be characterizing the anthocyanin composition and studying their stability.

"A Hot Topic, Literally, in Extrusion Technology","Physics is a turn-off word for many, as it sounds like the science education subject that it is. So people say, “It’s for them, we don’t need it” or “We couldn’t understand it anyway.” But physics involves things we all deal with every day — heat, light, sound, motion, and more. Getting the basics doesn’t require special training but does require some curiosity and resisting the human need for magic and the impossible.

No such thing as cold

We think we know what heat is. Maybe we even know that there is no such thing as cold — things are just hotter or cooler. That’s a good start. Temperature is a measure of how fast the molecules are moving. No molecules, as in space? No temperature. All motion uses energy, and heat is a form of energy, so the more energy that gets into a mass of molecules, the faster they move and the hotter it is. Cooling means energy is taken out and the molecules move more slowly. The energy may change form, but it doesn’t disappear. Energy can come from the sun, motion, breaking atom-atom bonds, electricity, condensing steam, hot air, and more. If enough energy leaves (cooling), all molecular motion stops and we have absolute zero, which is 273° below zero Celsius or 460° below zero Fahrenheit. It’s the same for all matter. Can’t get any colder than that.

Why two systems, C and F? Before around 1700, we didn’t measure temperature at all. If Shakespeare or Columbus asked about the weather, he’d get an answer in the vein of, “It’s very cold today, Will” or “Muy caliente, Capitán Colón.”

In the early 1700s Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, a German who lived in Holland, knew that mercury was liquid at room temperature and expanded with heat. He was a professional glassblower, so he made a glass tube with a very thin passage, got the mercury inside, and made the first thermometer, following a principle noted by Galileo 100 years before. He announced it in London in 1724 and the British adopted the system, using a scale from 0 to 100! With this scale, body temperature was 90 (it’s 98.6) and freezing water was 30 (it’s 32). Some think 100 and 0 were set as the hottest and coldest temperatures possible in Amsterdam. Or his tube wasn’t perfect. Whatever the reason, the British liked it, brought it over to the colonies (that’s us), and we’re still using it 300 years later.

Back in Europe, Anders Celsius, a Swede, wanted a more precise scale. In 1742, he proposed the freezing and boiling of water at sea level as 0 to 100, which became the centigrade (Celsius) system for the non-British rest of the world. In Fahrenheit, water at sea level boils at 212° and freezes at 32°. Neither scale works at high altitude — water boils at 202°F (94°C) in mile-high Denver, because the air pressure is lower and the liquid molecules need less energy to escape (boil) and become gas (water vapor = steam).

The role of heat in extrusion

We need heat to melt the plastic. We get most of it from the resistance to the motor turning the screw(s) in the barrel. Exceptions that need significant barrel heat are small machines, any machine that runs slowly, twin-screw extruders, extrusion coating, and some specialty high-temperature resins.

Plastics don’t have sharp melting/boiling points like water — all the molecules are not exactly the same, as they are in water. They do have melting ranges, which are known to processors, and glass-transition temperatures (T g ), above which they are tough and stretchable and below which they are glassy and brittle. These T g temperatures are mainly used by researchers and polymer makers.

The melting range is above this transition temperature, and the melt gets less viscous (thinner) as it gets hotter. We need to avoid too-hot melts that would degrade the plastic (break chains, discolor, weaken, contaminate) and this is a common limit to production speed. If barrel and head/die are kept too cool, more motor power is needed to convey and push out the melt, which puts more heat back into the melt. If we run too hot, however, it may degrade directly. Time at high temperature matters, too, which is why a big extruder may show degradation of the same material that ran OK at the same conditions on a small line. Cooling capacity matters, and may also be a rate limit.

Injection molding grades are lower viscosity (higher melt index) than extrusion grades, as they need to flow through thin-wall (high-resistance, cold) molds. They can be used in extrusion, but at lower melt temperatures, and may not be as strong as extrusion grades, which have longer molecules to get the lower melt index.

Measuring temperatures and other variables

Extruders need to set conditions — temperature settings on the barrel, head and die; maybe a pressure setting if that is controlled; and an idea of desired screw speed. We don’t usually run at top screw speed, as there are many other limits. We measure motor amps and screw speed, also melt pressure at or near the screw tip. We should also measure melt temperature in the head, which is not the same as the controlled metal temperatures (the conditions) but tells us when melt is too hot.

In principle, we could put a mercury thermometer into the extruder head to get melt temperature, but in practice we use a thermocouple, as we do to control the conditions. A thermocouple is a pair of wires of different metals, joined at both ends to make a circuit. When one end is hotter than the other, a small current flows in the circuit and can be measured, converted to temperature units, and displayed.

I would expect processors to want maximum thermal stability from resin makers and compounders. This is a result of polymerization — catalysts, reaction rate, and temperature — and can be further improved by additives (stabilizers, antioxidants), and also processing aids (viscosity reducers that require less power from the motor). But additives usually cost more than the resin itself, which means AMAN-ALAP (As Much As Necessary, As Little As Possible). It helps if you are already adding colorants.

Can we test incoming materials for thermal stability? Yes, but it’s not done often enough. A torque rheometer is useful with PVC compounds, and other plastics, too. Oven discoloration is used, also chemical tests, but suppliers should agree on what they are responsible for.

There are three ways to transfer heat:

Conduction, as a hot floor burns your feet if you walk on it barefoot;

convection, like a fan moving a fluid from one place to another;

radiation, like the sun or a space heater.

Often, two or all three of these are working together. You can also change the form of energy without adding any, such as charging a battery or human sweating (liquid water to water vapor, 539 calories/gram).

Power, heat, and energy are not the same: Power is HP or kW, heat is degrees F or C, and energy is Joules or KW-hour or calories. Melting needs energy, too: 80 cal/gm for water, less for anything else.

Copycat red nectar shows promise as a natural colorant and is gecko-approved,"Plants that secrete colored nectars are part of an exclusive club. To date, only 70 plants in the world are on that list. The colors lure in pollinators, but more recently they sparked the interest of researchers and industry partners in search of natural colorant options.

Over the past several years, a team of researchers, including a handful from the University of Minnesota, sorted out how plants produced distinctive red nectar and its makeup in a newly published study in Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences.

One of such plants, called Nesocodon mauritianus, is endemic to the island of Mauritius and first caught the eye of Clay Carter, a professor in the College of Biological Sciences, during a tour of the Conservatory & Botanical Collection at the University of Minnesota.

“I first met the plant on May 2, 2016 and wondered what is behind that red nectar,” says Carter. “When I started the research, I certainly wasn’t expecting to turn heads of multinational companies.”

The research team identified two enzymes never described in plants before. They compared Nesocodon mauritianus with another red nectar plant from the other side of the world. Surprisingly, these two plants both rely on the same compound — researchers named it nesocodin — to produce red nectar and attract their respective pollinators.

“Studying examples like these can tell us a lot about basic rules of adaptation, especially when viewed at the genetic and biochemical level,” says Carter.

The research also has direct applications. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, industry currently relies heavily on non-natural color additives. Red is a notoriously hard color to source for products, from candy to clothing, and beyond.

With knowledge of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms, researchers created a synthetic red nectar. The researchers also sought feedback from an expert in the form of geckos, a pollinator of Nesocodon mauritianus. The synthetic nectar passed the gecko test, which was run by researchers at George Mason University.

A gecko licks its lips after drinking a mixture of red nesocodin nectar and sugar. Geckos were also presented with a non-colored sugar sample which wasn't visited nearly as much as the one with nesocodin. In this case, the gecko drank for well over a minute. Credit: Ylenia Chiari.

“For years natural red colorants have been inaccessible for many product formulations because of their chemical properties,” says Adrian Hegeman, a professor in the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences and a co-author on the study. “Since nesocodin has different properties, it’s poised to work well in conditions where other natural colorants failed in the past.”

The University of Minnesota has applied for a patent for the process for synthesizing nesocodin and associated non-natural derivatives. These findings also set the groundwork for continuing research efforts, including one that is funded by a $1.3M award from the National Science Foundation, where the team is exploring more colored nectars.

"ADM’s ‘game-changer’ white colorant that ‘ticks the boxes on brilliance, stability and uniformity’","ADM is launching PearlEdge, a new colouring line derived from natural sources such as corn starch that delivers whites that are bright, stable and consistent.

The plant-based white colourant is designed to address the ‘toughest formulation challenges’ and perform ‘where other plant-based white colourants fall short’, according to the ingredient supplier.

ADM revealed ‘robust quality control’ is key to producing a precise white shade without the need for modification. ADM claims to have achieved this through its integrated supply chain, managing each step of the sourcing process.

“With our vertically integrated supply chain, we’re able to control the quality of the raw materials of the PearlEdge line from seed to fork, eliminating the need for our colour scientists to further modify the sources used for our bright white shades,”​ Hélène Moeller, Vice President of Global Product Marketing at ADM, told FoodNavigator.

PearlEdge also leverages ‘innovative and patent-pending technology’ and ‘extensive formulation expertise’, ADM added.

“We’re particularly excited about the possibilities with our PearlEdge Silk and Satin patent-pending technology,​” said Moeller. “With superior stability and performance as well as a white colour of similar intensity as [titanium dioxide] TiO2, PearlEdge Silk and Satin are game-changers for smooth white appearances in applications like panned confections and compressed tablets.”​

Demand for bright whites and the EU titanium dioxide ban

PearlEdge meets an important need in the market. In Europe, common white colouring titanium dioxide (E171) is being phased out by EU regulators over concerns it could be linked to cancer risk​. This has spurred a wave of reformulation in the region as food makers seek out alternatives to achieve bright whites in their end applications.

But the E171 backlash was not the only rationale prompting ADM to develop a new whitening alternative. According to Moeller, there has been a market need for a plant-based white colouring solution for some time.

“While the introduction of our PearlEdge line of proprietary white colour solutions comes at an ideal time with the approaching EU ban of titanium dioxide, we saw the need for plant-based white colourants that tick the boxes on brilliance, stability and uniformity much earlier,”​ she told this publication.

“Achieving a uniform, bright white can be challenging, and many current alternatives to TiO2, such as modified starch, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate, can present a broad-spectrum of formulation drawbacks and don’t always meet consumers’ clean-label expectations. Modified starch has poor solubility in cold water and high viscosity when gelatinized, requiring chemical modification to overcome these complications. Additionally, formulators using calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate may need to incorporate them at high usage rates to achieve desired whitening, negatively affecting texture and impacting cost,”​ the ingredient expert elaborated.

Improved functionality for top textures

These attributes are likely to be particularly appealing to confectionery and chewing gum manufacturers whose products are ‘most associated’ with ‘brilliant white offerings’. These categories can also benefit from the improved texture that the PearlEdge line is able to deliver.

“Our PearlEdge line provides critical ease in processing for product developers, and it even helps build in important texture qualities for certain applications. For instance, our PearlEdge Silk, Satin and Shine not only bring brilliant white to confections, but they also help create smooth and glossy surfaces,”​ we were told.

However, Moeller continued, other categories – particularly beverages – present a ‘clear need space’ in the industry.

“The line performs exceptionally well not only in confections, but also in powdered drink mixes and beverages; bakery icings and fillings; sugar-free offerings; soups, sauces and dressings; dairy and dairy alternatives; meat alternatives; and even pet food,”​ she elaborated.

“Derived from natural sources, each solution within our PearlEdge line is tailored to fit specific formulation requirements, such as functionality, sensory aspects and labeling goals. For example, we use our proprietary emulsion technology for our PearlEdge Splash and Splash+ to act as cloud agents for beverages creating cutting-edge uniformity and opacity.”​

PearlEdge is available in both powdered and liquid emulsion forms, allowing for a precise formulation approach depending on the food or beverage. Applications including confections, frostings, coatings, icings, meat and seafood alternatives, are likely to leverage the powdered solutions for best ‘vibrancy and texture’. For beverages, liquid emulsions perform the best to mitigate ringing, precipitation, sediments and staining.

Label friendly formulation

PearlEdge’s patent-pending tech allows formulators to achieve a ‘similar intensity’ of white as delivered by E171 while also providing stability and ‘improved texture’.

Pointing to demand for clean labels and recognizable ingredients identified in ADM’s Outside Voice research, Moeller explained that this line is derived from ‘familiar natural sources’, including native corn starch.

“Since the ingredients are minimally processed, our PearlEdge line helps product developers create clean-label offerings with the best quality whitening and opacity solutions,”​ she elaborated.

And while the E171 remains legal in a number of markets outside the EU, including the UK, Moeller said that she believes there is a global shift away from titanium dioxide and towards alternative clean label whitening agents.

“Solutions that can help meet clean label desires are important to other markets beyond the EU. In fact, the State of California in the US has discussed adding TiO2 to its Proposition 65 rules, and other regulatory bodies may begin to take a closer look. Plus, we’re already seeing manufacturers start to take TiO2 out of formulations. Moreover, shoppers are increasingly scrutinizing product labels and seeking ingredients that they associate with natural sources, pushing brands in regions around the world to find alternative solutions like our PearlEdge line, which is remarkable for meeting both formulation needs and labelling demands.​

""Since we’re able to control the quality parameters of our raw materials through vertical integration, we have a deep understanding of the characteristics and capabilities of our purposefully chosen ingredients within our PearlEdge line. This strong foundation, along with our technical ingenuity, proprietary, innovative processes and extensive ingredient library, gives brands the tools they need to create eye-catching foods and beverages.""​

Moeller concluded: “Our team has worked diligently to perfect our PearlEdge line to provide food and beverage manufacturers with the best quality, stable and uniform whitening and opacity solutions that also help meet clean-label targets. Our formulation ingenuity and cross-functional teams, as well as our vertical integration and global supply chain, were crucial components to bring our groundbreaking line to the industry.”​",,[],['Katy Askew']
NCRC Kannapolis location of NC State University awarded USDA grant to improve purple carrots for use in natural food colorants,"KANNAPOLIS, N.C. (WBTV) - From NCSU, the North Carolina Research Campus: The demand for natural food colorants, such as anthocyanins, continues to grow in the United States and worldwide due to the health promoting properties of plant pigments accompanied by a consumer shift away from synthetic food dyes.

North Carolina State University associate professor of plant genomics, Massimo Iorizzo, PhD, was awarded a $637,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA) to increase anthocyanin yield in purple carrots and to improve anthocyanin longevity in food products.

The US is the largest consumer and producer of natural food colorants. However, use of anthocyanins, a pigment found in red, blue and purple plant tissues, can be challenging due to varying yield, difficulty in color-matching a desired hue and concerns with color fastness for shelf life. There are more than 600 identified anthocyanins, some with more desirable traits for use as a food colorant than others.

One particularly promising source of anthocyanins for food colorants are purple carrots due to their accumulation of large quantities of more stable anthocyanin compounds. The majority of fresh market carrots available to consumers in the United States are orange; however, carrots that are red, yellow or purple are becoming more frequently available in fresh, frozen and juice products.

For the past five years, NC State has been involved in research originating and coordinated by the NC Biotechnology Center and funded by the NC Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services New and Emerging Crops Program investigating the feasibility of growing purple carrot varieties in different soil types, climates and growing seasons across North Carolina.

According to Hunter Barrier, New and Emerging Crops Program Coordinator, “This research demonstrated that high quality purple carrots can grow in North Carolina. Research continues to address production challenges and develop agronomic production recommendations for growing carrots in NC.”

NC State University awarded USDA grant to improve purple carrots for use in natural food colorants, pg 2 There may be additional market potential for purple carrots.

According to Paul Ulanch, Executive Director of the Crop Commercialization Program at the NC Biotechnology Center, “Additional agribusinesses have expressed interest in the purple carrot trials for potential expansion of production for fresh market carrots, juices, purees, and dried flours.”

In addition to assessing the agronomic and economic crop potential, postharvest carrot data collection included anthocyanin identification and quantification in collaboration with the NC Food Innovation Lab.

Iorizzo explains, “This grant will allow us to utilize genotyping and phenotyping to select carrot cultivars that can maximize anthocyanin yield and stability. Improving the purple carrot with anthocyanin extraction in mind is an important step in establishing it as a viable crop for our farmers and for the food ingredient market.”

There are no official statistics of worldwide purple carrot production at this time, however, the food industry estimates an annual need of 20 million pounds of carrot-derived anthocyanins to meet the growing demand.

For comparison, according to the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service, the US produced 3.4 billion pounds of fresh market carrots in 2020 valued at $10,600 per acre. This project will be led by Iorizzo at the Plants for Human Health Institute, North Carolina State University, which is located at the North Carolina Research Campus in Kannapolis, NC.

Iorizzo led the publication of the carrot genome and he is now focusing his research on nutritional and quality trait improvement of blueberry and carrot using advanced genomic tools. Food scientist, Mario Ferruzzi, PhD, Director, Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Center, is a collaborator on the project and will be characterizing the anthocyanin composition and studying their stability. This work is supported by the AFRI Foundational and Applied Science Program, Grant no. 2022-67013-36389, from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

How Are Colorants for Food Packaging Regulated in Japan?,"Wednesday, July 21, 2021

I understand that the Japan MHLW Notification No. 196 includes a positive list of substances used in synthetic resins used in food contact materials/articles. Colorants are not listed on this list, so are the JHOSPA approvals still the most relevant approvals for colorants used in food contact materials in Japan?

Answer

The new Positive List (PL) system does not change the way Japan regulates colorants for food-contact uses in Japan. Before and after the PL system took effect on June 1, 2020, only chemically synthesized colorants that are either designated additives or are not expected to migrate to food, in accordance with MHLW Notification No. 370, may be used in food-contact utensils, containers and packaging (UCP).

As MHLW Notification No. 370 did not provide a positive list of permitted colorants, the certificates issued by Japan Hygienic Olefin and Styrene Plastics Association (JHOSPA) for food-contact colorants have historically been used to demonstrate compliance under specified use conditions and may continue to be cited in support of the compliance status of such colorants for use in food contact products. However, it should be noted that, as of April of this year, the Food Contact Materials Safety Center within the Japan Chemical Innovation and Inspection Institute (JCII) has assumed the hygiene-related business of JHOSPA, The Japan Hygienic PVC Association (JHPA), and The Japan Hygienic Association of Vinylidene Chloride (JHAVDC). Accordingly, JCII is expected to continue to issue confirmation certificates for products that meet the JHOSPA voluntary standard. Additional details are available on the JCII website in Japanese (here).",,[],[]

Milliken prepares to launch major clarifier plant,"Milliken will begin production at its new clarifier plant soon in Blacksburg, SC. This significant additional capacity will address the strong worldwide demand for clarified plastic products. The company, a manufacturer with plastic additives and colorants expertise, says this new, facility will increase the production capacity of its market-leading Millad NX 8000 polypropylene clarifier by more than 50%.

“This represents the largest clarifier plant investment in Milliken history,” said Cindy Boiter, president of Milliken’s Chemicals Business. “Engineering is complete, and we are in the process of commissioning the plant. When we launch production in the fall, it will allow us to address both current market needs and increasing demand for these products well into the future.”

“Global demand for Millad NX 8000 clarifier has grown at an 11% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for each of the past nine years,” added Boiter. “Global clarifier demand grew by 16% in just the past two years,” outstripping the growth rates for global polypropylene (PP) resin. “All regions have contributed to the growth of clarified PP, with Asia leading the way.”

A number of factors are driving this demand. Milliken’s own customer research underscores the importance of being able to clearly see the products they are buying. Millad NX 8000 provides close to glass-like clarity in PP packaging, which improves customer confidence during their buying process, especially for food products. This clarity enables brand owners to replace PET, polystyrene, polycarbonate and more with PP — shown by studies to be a more sustainable option. The current soaring energy prices, meanwhile, have also spiked interest in any resins or additives like this one, which can help converters to save energy during processing and improve production efficiency. As a result of these certified savings, brand owners using PP clarified with Millad NX 8000 Eco can display a UL environmental claim validation label on their injection molded parts.

Polypropylene is not only lightweight and durable. It also is one of the least energy-intensive polymers to make and recycle compared to other clear polymers.

“Brand owners and packaging producers are seeing how Millad NX 8000 can contribute to improved environmental and manufacturing results. It is one of the more important clarifier developments in recent memory,” said Global vice-president – Plastic Additives Wim Van de Velde.

Additionally, the pandemic has dramatically altered many consumer habits, perhaps permanently, in the case of booming eCommerce and the growing popularity of food-delivery services. Thin-wall injection molded containers made using clarified PP – with their lightweight, durable and transparent characteristics – have proven to be a popular solution to packaging challenges facing both the eCommerce and food-service industries. “We don’t see that changing,” said Van de Velde.",,[],"['The Editorial Team Of Ipp', 'Psa Handle All The Press Releases.

What makes natural colors?,"You may be wondering, what makes a color natural? Follow along with us as we see what makes up natural colorants, and how they influence the Chef Rubber Natural Color Lines.

Keep reading to learn about the 4 main groups of where natural pigments are derived from:

Carotenoid

Carotenoids are what gives fruits and vegetables like sweet potatoes and pumpkins their color. Pigments like red, yellow and orange are made with carotenoids.

Chlorophyll

A naturally occurring pigment that is found in all green plants. Most known as green.

Anthocyanin

This is where purple and blue are derived from. Foods like grapes, blueberries and even cranberries have this pigment in them and that’s how these foods get such a deep and rich hue.

Curcumin

Also known as turmeric, it’s not only a root of the curcuma longa plant, but it’s also a rich pigment for achieving a deep yellow.

Chef Rubber food colors are available in multiple forms – from powder, to liquid, gel, and paste. Which to choose will depend on the dessert, confection or beverage that is being created. The two main categories in colors for the food industry are water soluble and fat dispersible (lakes and dyes).

What does that mean?

A water-soluble colorant works best when the water content in the recipe is higher than the fat content. The best example would be when making macaron batter – the most common selection isa gel or water-based powder color that is easily mixed with the water content in the egg whites. Similarly, a fat dispersible color added to a fat-bases product like chocolate will work significantly better than adding a water-soluble colorant.

The creative mind and pastry knowledge of the Chef Rubber founders have developed and launched a full line of natural colorants. These products are derived from vegetables, fruits, herbs, and spices. Chef Rubber has natural options in both water-based and fat-based colorants.

Fun facts about food color

Yellow and red combined make you hungry.

Provide decorative and artistic freedoms.

Colors can trick you into tasting things that aren’t there.

Tips for using natural colorants

Back natural colors with white to really make colors pop.

Allow time for natural pigment to develop.

Keep colors out of direct light, to help with fading.

"DIC, Debut Biotech Team Up to Develop and Bio-Manufacture Natural Pigments for More Sustainable Food Colorants and Cosmetics","TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DIC Corporation (TOKYO:4631) announced a joint research development agreement with California-based biotech startup Debut Biotechnology, Inc., further enhancing DIC efforts to develop natural pigments for food colorants and cosmetics.

In recent years, increasingly urgent climate concerns have increased global consumer demand for biodegradable, naturally derived colorants—notably in foods and cosmetics—to replace synthetic petroleum-derived colorants. This rapidly increasing consumer demand has motivated major global brands to seek out more sustainable materials for their products.

Unfortunately, the increasing efforts to extract useful pigments from natural materials, including flowers or plants, continue to face significant commercialization challenges, including unacceptably low yields, excessive post-extraction waste generation, and environmental burdens, such as land and water use. Moreover, problems specific to agriculture, such as increasingly unstable weather as well as qualitative and quantitative fluctuations remain as barriers to efficient production.

While more organizations are now researching ways to efficiently culture bacteria, yeast, or algae, etc., using biological reactions within cells to produce needed materials, the by-products generated by these reactions continue to foil attempts to conduct reaction processes under optimum conditions.

Debut’s proprietary next-generation continuous cell-free biomanufacturing technology overcomes these traditional biomanufacturing barriers—retaining enzymes and other useful parts of cells, while discarding limiting parts. By working with vital cell enzymes and such under optimum conditions, Debut Biotech engineers optimize reactions, synthesizing stable targets with high purity to efficiently and continuously manufacture biomaterials and other active ingredients previously overlooked due to low material yields.

Debut, CEO Joshua Britton said, “With our advanced cell-free biomanufacturing platform, we’re able to produce color ingredients that are simply not possible with traditional fermentation-based biomanufacturing. Our colors are naturally-derived with a fraction of the inputs—less waste and energy—and without the use of petrochemicals. With this approach, we’re able to take on a level of complexity that creates whole new possibilities for the color ingredient landscape across industries. We’re thrilled to be working with DIC as they’re established leaders in the color ingredients industry.”

DIC Managing Executive Officer Kiyofumi Takano said, “DIC hopes to combine Debut's advanced knowledge of enzyme reactions and process design with DIC’s scale-up technology, quality control, and product development capabilities to develop and commercialize new sustainable, high value-added bio-based colorants, pigments, and healthy foods for global markets.”",,[],[]
Phytolon and Ginkgo Bioworks collaborate on food colors,"Through the partnership, Phytolon is leveraging Ginkgo's ability to engineer biology at scale to work together on the production of vibrant betalain pigments, the healthy and colorful compounds found in foods like beets and cactus fruit.

The project aims to take Phytolon's colors across the full 'yellow-to-purple' spectrum to the next level, and to potentially maximize the business opportunity of Phytolon's vibrant colors for applications in the food and cosmetics industries.

Biotechnology offers an opportunity to tap into the vibrant colors of biology to produce more sustainable, yet equally vibrant, colors. While artificial dyes are visually appealing and cheap to manufacture, some have been banned in food and feed due to health concerns. As consumers increasingly seek out more sustainable and nature-derived products, the food industry is working to find food colors with equivalent pigment vibrancy to those found in synthetic chemical dyes but which come from biological rather than petrochemical sources.

Phytolon has developed a proprietary process for producing betalain pigments through precision fermentation of certain yeast strains. Together, Phytolon and Ginkgo are partnering with the goal of maximizing the production efficiency of purple and yellow betalain-producing strains.

""We're excited to work with Ginkgo to develop natural food colors that can potentially outperform conventional artificial dyes in cost and performance,""​ said Dr Tal Zeltzer, co-founder and CTO of Phytolon.

""We believe biotechnology makes it possible to produce a wider range of colors than ever before that may outperform current benchmark colorants, and we look forward to building products that may meet and even exceed consumer expectations for healthier, sustainable foods, all while aiming to maintain industry requirements for high quality and cost-efficiency.""​

""We love enabling growing startups like Phytolon through our platform, using biotechnology to challenge industry norms and attempt to build a fundamentally better product than what's on the market today,""​ said Jennifer Wipf, head of commercial, cell engineering at Ginkgo Bioworks.

""The planet needs new sustainable solutions, and we are excited to partner with Phytolon to support a more sustainable food system.""​",,[],['Jim Cornall']
Nature’s Painters: Making Sustainable Colors with Microbes,"The production of textile dyes and food colorants can have a big environmental footprint. Biotech startups are rising to the challenge by engineering bacteria, fungi, and algae to sustainably produce natural colors.

Eight years ago, University of Cambridge researcher Jim Ajioka was in Nepal helping to produce a biosensor to detect arsenic in drinking water and was shocked at how poor the water quality was in the region.

“In Kathmandu, all of the textile industry just dumps its waste straight into the water and into the river… there’s almost no regulation,” Ajioka told me. “The other place that I went to was Dhaka in Bangladesh… and again, it’s exactly the same problem.”

While historically many dyes came from natural sources, the first synthetic color, a shade of purple called mauveine, was produced by accident in 1856 using petrochemical techniques. Now, around 99% of dyes come from petroleum and fossil fuel sources because they are generally quicker, easier, and cheaper to produce than natural dyes.

Seeing the impact of the fashion industry on the water in Nepal and Bangladesh inspired Ajioka and his colleague Orr Yarkoni to found Colorifix. This UK-based biotech company focuses on creating sustainable fabric dyes by genetically modifying microbes to produce a variety of natural pigments.

Around 300 million people work in the fashion industry, many of whom are low-paid workers in developing countries like Bangladesh and Nepal. Chemical dyes used in the industry are often toxic. Not only do they come from unsustainable sources, but many workers are at increased risk for skin diseases and cancer from regular exposure to these dyes.

“Dyeing and rinsing fabric with chemical dyes also requires a lot of water – about 20% of global water pollution stems from the textile industry,” said Renana Krebs. She graduated from university with a degree in fashion in 2011 and then worked as a designer for elite fashion companies in the UK and Germany. “I had an amazing job and was passionate about my work, but at the same time I saw behind the scenes of the industry. I saw how they treated the workers.”

“I’ve been in the Far East and saw rivers in the colors of the next season. You can’t see that and just do nothing. People thought I was crazy, but I quit my job and did a Master’s in sustainable design.”

Since then Krebs has found a new calling as a biotech CEO. She co-founded Algaeing (previously Alga-Life) with her father Oded Krebs in 2016. Split between Berlin and Israel, the company focuses on making sustainable dyes and cloth out of algae.

“All of our colors are made from algae. Some algae can even produce multiple colors. Think of leaves: in summer they’re green, then in autumn they become brownish or orange,” says Krebs, who emphasizes that they don’t harvest algae from the ocean or wild water sources. “The algae grow in a closed-loop vertical farming system with zero waste and no use of agricultural land, powered by solar energy.”

French biotech Pili Bio is also using microbes to produce sustainable fabric dyes. The company had an unconventional start in an abandoned train hangar turned community laboratory.

“We came from a ‘bio-hackerspace’ rather than a conventional academic lab. A biological discovery is not at the origin of the company, but we wanted to tackle an environmental problem and we gathered the resources and talents little by little to solve it,” says company CEO Jérémie Blache, who himself comes from a business background.

Content continues below Related Content

The company started as four students with an idea and a proof of concept in 2015 and is now a team of 26. Blache says that the next challenge for the company is to “finance and build the first production factory of biobased colors.”

Bacteria, fungi, and algae have been producing natural pigments for millennia. But our ability to exploit these organisms at an industrial scale has only been made possible in recent years thanks to synthetic biology techniques.

“One of the things people ought to realize is, none of this is magic. It’s just an observation of biology,” says Ajioka. “Everybody’s seen this. When you go around your house, you see mold, mildew, or red stains on your tiles in the bathroom, because there are microorganisms living there and they’re making pigments and depositing them on the surface.”

However, there are several challenges associated with introducing a new, sustainable dying process to a large and well-established industry.

“We wanted to make sure that everything that we did had the lowest travel footprint possible,” says Ajioka. “We designed and built our own fermenters to be suitable for working in a dye house environment.”

He explained that although initially advised against it, going down this route has allowed the company to maintain consistency of its dyeing processes and reduce its carbon footprint. Their fermentors are also cheap compared with others available on the market. “They’re about a fifth of the cost. We can undercut the competition. It helps in standardization, because we can make things cost-effective.”

Colorifix is helping dye houses perform the whole dying process in a fermentor on site. Other companies are developing pigments using microbes, which they then supply to dye houses to use instead of conventional dyes. While just providing the pigment is theoretically simpler, it is a less sustainable alternative since it still requires all of the other chemicals used in the dyeing process.

Sustainable colors in food

The production of synthetic food colorants can also be a source of pollution. But natural food colorants are not without problems. Some rely on extracts from vegetables such as beetroot and carrots, which can take up large amounts of agricultural growing space.

“We believe there’s a better way to do that, and a more efficient way to do that via fermentation,” said Gerit Tolborg, CEO and co-founder of Chromalogics, a Danish biotech aiming to solve this problem.

“Instead of using these high value raw materials that you could also use to feed people, the argument is for moving the production of natural food colorings to the lab. You only use sugar as [a raw material], you have a very efficient conversion, and you can even use the byproducts and put them back on the field for fertilizing.”

The science behind Chromalogics is based on Tolborg’s PhD project, during which she was able to isolate a red pigment from a rare fungus, Talaromyces atroroseus. “We were able to isolate the pigments, then we learned that there were novel pigments that have never been described before, [which] opened our patent opportunity.”

Red food coloring is high in demand, making up 50% of all food colorings, according to Tolborg. There is currently a gap in the market, as most food and drink manufacturers want to stay away from artificial colorings. At the same time, they don’t want to use carmine, the current best natural red food coloring, as it is made from beetles and therefore not vegetarian.

Chromalogics was set up in 2017 to develop an alternative food colorant. Since then, Tolborg and colleagues have been working hard at testing the toxicity and stability of their pigment, as well as tackling the industrial scale-up problem. But the biggest challenge will undoubtedly be getting approval from both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), admits Tolborg.

“There’s just so much out of our hands… We have a lot of data that indicates it’s not toxic, but we’ll only know once the authorities say yes, you can use it.”

Another company using fermentation to produce food colors is Israeli startup Phytolon. The firm is engineering yeast to produce betalain pigments, which are naturally found in beetroot and other purple and red vegetables and flowers.

“Companies like Starbucks stopped using carmine, Campari stopped using carmine, but they still need a stable color. They don’t really have that because the [alternatives] are just not stable enough. And that’s the gap,” says Tolborg.

A future of sustainable colors

With increasing consumer interest in achieving a circular economy, big players in the fashion and food industries are more interested than ever before in becoming more sustainable.

“Extra-financial objectives are timidly implemented in companies, which helps to move away from projects focused on pure performance or cost reduction,” says Blache. “But the ones who make the biggest difference in my eyes are the executives who dare to adopt sustainable products, even if they are not yet competitive in terms of price. They allow offers like ours to emerge.”

As many of these biotech companies are relatively new, there are still some hurdles to overcome. For example, some colors are easier than others to produce. Ajioka says he and his colleagues are on a quest to make a good quality black dye from melanin extracted from fungi. “Black is actually a hard color to make, because it’s usually a mix of different colors to cover the [light] spectrum. There actually isn’t a lot of research on how it works, all we can do is try to mimic the processes that happen, for example, in fungi.”

Other challenges are more on the business end, such as persuading conventional dye houses or food manufacturers to take a chance on a new process, as well as keeping the costs affordable for the industry.

While the fashion and food industries are only at the early stages of implementing true sustainability, Krebs thinks this will become more important as time goes on.

“Sustainability used to be a ‘nice to have’, now it’s a ‘must’. I believe that companies that aren’t going to change are not going to remain a part of this industry. We need to look at the bigger picture of how this world is going to survive. For a real systematic change, solutions need to be economical, and proven to work for people and the planet.”",,[],['Helen Albert']

Chemistry professor to deliver annual George Tseo Memorial Lecture on April 19,"HAZLETON, Pa. – Penn State Hazleton’s Lectures and Cultural Events committee will host Kristin Wustholz, Mansfield Associate Professor of Chemistry at the College of William & Mary, as guest speaker for the campus’ annual George Tseo Memorial Lecture at 12:15 p.m. on Tuesday, April 19. It will be livestreamed via Zoom.

Wustholz will lead a lecture titled, “Revealing the Invisible: SERS Studies of Fugitive Organic Pigments in Art.”

According to Wustholz, the identification of so-called “fugitive” organic colorants in cultural heritage objects is an important and challenging task in conservation research. Since many organic dyes and pigments are prone to fading, the detection of these materials is crucial for the proper assessment of damage, conservation treatment, and the prevention of further color alterations with time. While numerous methods exist to characterize colorants in art, recent advances in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) methodologies have for the first time enabled the unambiguous identification of organic dyestuffs in microscopic samples from paintings in a minimally invasive manner.

In this presentation, SERS studies of several oil paintings being prepared for exhibition at the Art Museums of Colonial Williamsburg will be discussed. These paintings were made in England and the southern British colonies of North America during the 18th century and include examples from Charles Willson Peale and Sir Joshua Reynolds.

By combining cutting-edge scientific analysis with conservation and curatorial studies, this collaborative effort between William & Mary and Colonial Williamsburg has revealed the identity of several organic pigments within broad-scale, quantity-rich areas of compositions, as well as more challenging fleshtones and small, yet important, detail regions. These studies reveal the fugitive palette that was used to create these paintings and inform digital re-colorizations that are displayed in the museum setting to show their more original appearance.

The lecture is held annually in memory of Tseo, a professor of earth sciences at Penn State Hazleton from 1988 until his untimely death from cancer in 2005. The series honors his memory and diverse interests by featuring speakers with backgrounds in science, history, art, music and many other fields.",,[],[]
The Best Color Pigment For Epoxy Resin,"Epoxy resin is a versatile product for crafting (and other household applications) because it comes as a clear liquid adhesive that can be shaped and molded. Once a hardener is added, it then becomes solid. This makes it perfect for creating items like jewelry, ornaments, coasters, and other attractive decorative items.

Medium- and high-viscosity epoxies have consistencies like thick honey and are suitable for coating surfaces. You can use them to make many kinds of resin art. For the most part, epoxy resins are colorless and transparent, and you have to take safety precautions when working with them.

Artists and crafters who use epoxy resins usually like to add color to create attractive designs within the medium. Never use paints that contain water, though, as this could prevent the resin from curing or cause other problems.

The two main kinds of coloring agents you can use for epoxy resins are liquid-form color concentrates and powdered color pigments. You can also use some of these to create soap, makeup and other small goods.

Always opt for high-quality products because they have the most vibrant colors, are easiest to blend and last the longest. Some feature translucent, pearlescent and other reflective finishes that make your pieces look exciting and luminous. Before adding color, though, you will have to mix the resin.

Pour a small amount of the color pigment into the mixture before it hardens, and stir with a mixing stick. Only add a small amount at a time because you can always drop in a bit more; once the color is wrong or too dark, you may have to start over. Follow the package directions for mixing and use your judgment for the color; both novices and pros like to experiment here, and the results vary.",,[],[]
"Natural blue colorant for hot and cold drinks withstands heat processing, low pH, and full pasteurization","Israel-based FoodTech startup Gavan Ltd. has developed proprietary technology to produce natural blue coloring that is highly stable in hot and cold drinks. Finding stable, natural alternatives for blue coloring has been one of the biggest challenges for companies in the natural colors industry.

Gavan has now added a new natural blue colorant to its line of natural blue colorings. Derived from spirulina, the new natural blue color is said to withstand high-heat processing and low-pH environments, enabling full pasteurization. Said the company in a press release, “The new coloring formulation is ideal for hot beverages such as tea and coffee as well as functional drinks and sports drinks. Such products typically require specific production parameters, including infusion in boiling water or acidic medium.”

Natural alternatives to blue colors have been challenging to find. In a press release, Yael Leader, head of product for Gavan, explained: “Both synthetic blue dyes and plant-based blue coloring have regulatory, stability, intensity, or price challenges. The main barrier to creating food formulations with natural colors is stability—the ability to overcome formulation challenges and ensure vibrant and consistent true blue throughout the product’s shelf life.”

Beverages have been especially difficult for natural blue colors, the company said, because “delivering a heat-stable, naturally derived, vibrant blue for products with low pH is tricky. Any heat treatment might impact the color irreversibly, and any shift in the pH can impair the color stability and influence the blue color’s shade.” Fortified ingredients added to a functional beverage can also throw off the color by reacting with the colorant, speeding up color degradation, causing fading, or causing pigments and minerals to bind and create sedimentation, Leader said.

Gavan uses its proprietary process to extract phycocyanin, the pigment-protein complex synthesized by blue-green microalgae like spirulina that produces a pure blue shade. Gavan’s technology for yielding phycocyanin from spirulina “extracts and optimizes the colorant gently, without damaging the source, and enables the extraction of multiple compounds from the whole spirulina, without waste,” the company says. The process, which is non-GMO, prevents the colorant from fading, even when exposed to pH levels as low as 3.0 or when pasteurized at 90°C for 30 seconds, the firm says. It also enables control over particle size, which helps improve stability over the final product’s shelf life.

According to Gavan, the ability to extract this stable, natural blue colorant ultimately gives formulators a wide range of color options in addition because blue is a primary color that can be used to create other colors like green and purple. These offshoot colors are said to also be highly stable and vivid.

The technology can also be applied to other plant-based alternatives. “Gavan’s proprietary technology enables us to transform spirulina or other plant-based compounds and sources into easy-to-use, water-dispersible food colorings suitable for hot and cold beverages,” said Itai Cohen, Gavan’s CEO and cofounder, in the press release.

As for the blue shade, said Cohen, “Gavan’s blue can replace artificial coloring and opens options for acidic beverages to be colored with any blue shades. It has no impact on flavor and maintains a clear, clean label. Our advanced platform can revolutionize plant-based products across multiple categories.”",,[],['Jennifer Grebow']
"Preventing dyes, and a cultural tradition, from fading","Every artwork comes with its own set of challenges for conservators and curators, not least of which is curbing the effects of time. To that end, a device known as a microfading tester (MFT) gives art stewards a much better sense of where and for how long they can safely display a particular work before irreversible fading occurs. At Yale, researchers are working to make this technology not just more accessible to museums everywhere, but as a means to preserve cultural heritage in other parts of the world.

Developed by Paul Whitmore, the now-retired director of the Aging Diagnostics Lab at Yale's Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (IPCH), the MFT device helps predict how fast colorants, such as pigments and dyes, will fade under normal gallery display conditions. Using fiber optics, the device shines an intense beam of light on a microscopic spot of a material, measures the reflected light, and triggers the photochemical reactions that would cause light-sensitive colors to fade. Every minute the light shines on the material is equal to about one year of aging. Researchers typically use it for up to 5 minutes at a time, allowing them to see five years into the material’s future.

“The MFT allows us to monitor dye or pigment fading in real time, predicting fading behavior in gallery conditions,” said Katherine Schilling, associate research scientist in chemical and environmental engineering and associate conservation research scientist at the IPCH. Because the microfading test essentially leaves no trace of altered color, objects can be quickly screened for their lightfastness – that is, how long dyes can resist the effects of fading. This helps determine future storage or exhibition requirements.

With the MFT, researchers can get information about the light sensitivity of everything from sloth fur to bird feathers to paintings, drawings, photographs, and textiles. Most recently, IPCH has been using the technique to test dyes used in rugs originating from an indigenous weaving community in Afghanistan, in support of a collaboration between Yale researchers and a non-governmental organization (NGO) that supports Afghan artisans, primarily women. (Due to the political instability in Afghanistan, a representative requested that the NGO’s name not be used).

The project aims to help Afghan weavers find the best possible colorants, partly to preserve a centuries-old tradition, but also to give Afghan women a better chance to earn a livable income. Prior to the August 2021 takeover by the Taliban, there were known to be about 1 million rug weavers in the country. Even under the best of conditions, weaving is not an easy way to make a living.

“We partnered with a dynamic organization with the capacity to work directly in regions where weaving and other traditional artforms have been decimated by commercial or political interests, and now war and famine,” said Alison Gilchrest, the director of the IPCH. “These are communities where skills and methods have been passed through families for generations, and they deserve an opportunity to thrive.”

The NGO’s representative noted that exporting handmade products has become a significantly growing industry, in part because people are increasingly buying with sustainability in mind.

“We work with a lot of retail partners who know their customers, and know exactly what sort of styles they like,” she said. “We have to make sure that we can present a product to them that works, based on their very serious commercial standards, and one of those concerns is fading. It happens in carpets and textiles through light and through touch. If you're going to create high-value jobs for women in rural Afghanistan, you better be able to create a product that doesn't fade.”

At the IPCH laboratory on Yale’s West Campus, the researchers work with a large dye sampler rug provided by the NGO. In a grid of 190 squares, the sampler features patches of all the dyes used by the weavers.

“We're working through the sampler systematically to arrive at recommendations for which colors are more prone to fade,” Schilling said. “Given the range of options, the weavers can then make substitutions and hopefully still achieve a similar aesthetic effect.”

Contributing to the Afghan rug project are two students, Vanessa Lamar, a physics major, and Daniela Flores, a chemical engineering major. Schilling prepared the students for this work by creating an independent study of the photochemistry of colorants during the spring semester. Using the MFT instrument, they measured various materials’ lightfastness. Lamar said there was a bit of a learning curve in working the microfading device, but her physics background was a big help. At the end of the semester, she decided to continue with the project through the summer.

“I never thought that I'd be able to do something that combines my interest in art and humanities with science, and this position gives me an opportunity to explore that world,” she said. “Even though I usually work with numbers and machines, it’s good to know that the work I'm doing has a human impact.”

The IPCH researchers also plan to broaden the use of the MFT- a goal that calls for a redesign to make it less costly and more usable for museums around the world. The lab contains a few versions of the MFT that were made since Whitmore invented it in the 1990s. It’s time, the researchers said, for a more extensive reworking.

“The best way to honor the legacy of the project is to build on its success,” Schilling said. It’s an ingenious device, but it can be tricky to use, even for other scientists. It’s also pricey - creating a new one could cost up $30,000, depending on the components. Several research teams in the U.S. and abroad, including the cross-disciplinary team at SEAS and IPCH - are working to bring the cost down to about $6,000.

“Our goal is to figure out how to make this technology accessible and transferrable at a lower price point,” Schilling said. “We want to simplify the instrument design and software so that our partners and collaborators around the world can have access to the same powerful method.”

The more broadly the microfading technique is used, the more useful it becomes.

“If we can make the device and the method more accessible, then the global heritage community starts to build larger bodies of predictive data,” Gilchrest said.

Adding to the research was Arizona high school student Ella Wang, who worked with the MFT as part of MIT’s Research Science Institute program, which recruits top high school students from around the world for immersive science and engineering research during the summer. Working with Schilling and SEAS Deputy Dean Vincent Wilczynski, she used color maps and fading simulations to model the fading effects of UV rays.

When the researchers finish collecting data for the Afghan rug project, they’ll provide their research to the NGO, which will use it to help the rug weavers get the best quality materials for their craft. “It’s a small project with potentially far-reaching impact,” Gilchrest said. Besides getting valuable scientific research out of it, she said, it’s a chance to make a difference for a particular community at a time when it most needs help.

“There’s a pressing need to support these endangered and under-resourced communities in documenting and preserving their heritage,” she said. “And with our deep and integrated science and art capacity at Yale, embodied by IPCH, it is incumbent on us to continuously question what more we can be doing on a global stage.”

"Scientists Are Making Cochineal, a Red Dye From Bugs, in the Lab","An average trip to the grocery store can yield a cartful of colorful foods. Bright among the rainbow are the reds, lending hues to products such as raspberry jam, canned cherries, strawberry licorice and red velvet cake. Often, their source is a certain small insect.

Cochineal bugs — oval-shaped scale insects around 0.2 inches long — are harvested and turned into the natural dyes cochineal extract, carmine and the pure pigment carminic acid. They have been used to color food, textiles and cosmetics for centuries.

Today, though, traditional labor-intensive harvesting methods are under strain due to rising demand, and prices for the natural pigment have increased. So some scientists are exploring genetic engineering to produce carminic acid in what they hope could be a cheaper, faster and more sustainable way. The efforts, though experimental right now, could also appease those who want non-animal sources of the colorants in their foods, these scientists say.

“It has the potential for a paradigm shift for the production of that compound,” says synthetic biologist Rasmus J. N. Frandsen of the Technical University of Denmark.

The story of carminic acid traces back thousands of years to bright red Phoenician garments colored by a crushed scale insect of the Kermes genus. Hues harvested from the bug’s cousin from the Americas, Dactylopius coccus, graced scarlet goods during the reigns of the Mayan and Aztec empires. In the 1500s, Spaniards documented widespread cochineal harvesting in the New World along with the preparation and trade of the dye. Entranced by the bold color, they shipped dried insects by the ton back to Europe to replace the drabber dyes then in use there.

The scarlet spread across the world like wildfire: It funded empires, stained religious garb and was showcased in masterpiece paintings — becoming a precious commodity rivaling silver and gold.

Use of carminic acid in its various forms in textiles and art waned with industrialization and development of synthetic dyes in the mid-1800s, says biomedical dye chemist Dick Dapson of the Biological Stain Commission, which tests and certifies dyes. But the pigment continued to color food, drugs and cosmetics to enhance their appearances. Between 1967 and 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration gradually approved cochineal extract and carmine for such purposes, and these cochineal insect derivatives still add color to various yogurts, cakes, candies, beverages and meats.

Use of a bug extract in food shouldn’t alarm, says University of Guadalajara biotechnologist Liberato Portillo Martinez, who has studied cochineal insects for decades. The amount of insect remaining in the pigment is minuscule — and besides, he adds, many food products are deemed safe and approved for sale even if they contain small amounts of whole or fragmented insects.

Today, Peru is the largest commercial producer of the D. coccus cochineal insect, followed by countries such as Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Spain’s Canary Islands. Many aspects of production remain the same as they were thousands of years ago. Workers start by rearing the bug on its plant of choice, the prickly pear (also known as the pear cactus or nopal) of the Opuntia genus. The insects are dried and sold to processors, who extract carminic acid, which makes up around 20 percent in dry weight of the cochineal insect’s body.

Mills the size of phone booths grind the bugs to powder. Then the powder is paired with salts to isolate carmine — the commonly sold product of cochineal insects that’s 50 percent to 60 percent carminic acid.

With current harvesting methods, an estimated 70,000 bugs are needed to produce one pound of dried insect and a fifth of a pound of carminic acid. “It is time-consuming labor, but there is something funny about it: If you start working with cochineal, you fall in love with it,” Portillo Martinez says.

The use of carminic acid from cochineal insects has fluctuated over time. The rise of synthetic dyes, which were cheaper to produce, caused a decline in use of cochineal insects starting in the mid-1800s. But from around the 1970s, health concerns about these synthetics began to mount — stemming from reports of a link between the colorings and hyperactivity in kids, as well as some cell and animal studies suggesting that certain dyes may raise risk of cancer. This prompted the eventual ban of some of them, such as Red 2 and Red 4. Dyes of natural origin, like carminic acid, began to grow more popular as a result, Dapson says.

Synthetic dyes are still widely used in American foods, and there are growing numbers of vegans, vegetarians and animal-rights activists who don’t want to inadvertently eat an insect product like carmine. Some studies have reported allergic reactions to cochineal dye in a small proportion of people due to residual insect molecules — but at levels no higher than for other common allergens, Frandsen says.

Still, overall global demand for carminic acid is projected to increase as industries source it for coloring sweets, drinks, jams and meats. This, along with climbing costs of labor, is straining the cochineal industry. In Peru, the price per ton of carmine dye rose 40 percent between 2013 and 2019.

“Habitat for cacti is limited, growth of both host and parasite are slow, and extraction procedures are woefully inefficient,” Dapson says. “Improvements in extraction and purification have been made, but they don’t address the core problem, which is production of the insects.”

Biochemical challenges

In recent years, researchers have turned to metabolic engineering — the manipulation of natural cellular reactions to yield desired products — to see if they can devise a sustainable solution to the production bottleneck as well as to address concerns about animal additives and allergies. The idea is to biosynthetically manipulate metabolic pathways inside microbes to create carminic acid.

And there are other possibilities: “In addition to making the carminic acid, we will be able to make a bit of change in the carminic acid as well. We could do better colors and maybe better biological activity,” says microbial engineer Yong-Su Jin of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who wrote about emerging genetic technologies in producing food colors and flavors in the 2022 Annual Review of Food Science and Technology.

But there are challenges. For one, carminic acid has a complicated structure: a central three-ring structure called anthraquinone to which a glucose molecule and a few other chemical groups are attached. That makes it difficult to synthesize in large amounts, says industrial chemist David Bott of the Society for Chemical Industry.

Scientists still don’t even know the full biochemical pathway that cochineal insects use to make the compound, Frandsen says. And so, almost a decade ago, his team decided to start with the structure of the end product — carminic acid — and figure out how to reverse-engineer it with enzymes from known biochemical pathways.

“Take a rocket, for example,” he says. “You don’t know how it works, but you can see that it flies, right? How do we get the different parts? What should be combined to get this?”

Frandsen and colleagues began by predicting the needed starting ingredients and biochemical steps, as well as enzymes to catalyze those steps. They devised eight potential biochemical pathways that might create carminic acid and tested several hosts to do their genetic engineering in, eventually settling on a well-studied fungus called Aspergillus nidulans. It was easy to analyze yet complex enough to provide the key chemical ingredients for the reactions.

Through trial and error, the team created the three-ring core of carminic acid after deleting some genes from the fungus (to disable competing biochemical pathways) and adding several others (one from a plant and two from bacteria) that provided the appropriate enzymes. This core was then processed by an unknown enzyme already in Aspergillus to produce an intermediate structure called kermesic acid.

Finally, addition of a gene from the cochineal insect itself provided an enzyme that converted kermesic acid into carminic acid. When the fungus was engineered with all these genes, the broth in which it was growing turned red, and tests confirmed the presence of the dye in the broth and in the fungus.

The team’s paper, published in 2018, provided proof of principle that a microbe could be engineered to make carminic acid. But the efficiency of the reaction was nowhere near high enough to consider large-scale manufacturing, Frandsen says. And because one of the enzymes remained unknown, it would be hard to optimize production.

“It was a long struggle with lots of things that should work in theory, but which did not in the real world,” he says. “The truth about synthetic biology is that it is very early days, and results are often presented as, ‘We just did it and it was easy,’ while the reality is way different.”

A 2021 study by another team devised an alternate biosynthetic pathway for carminic acid, this time introducing genes into the well-known bacterium E. coli, chosen for its ease of manipulation and potential for large-scale manufacturing. The work differed in its approach from the 2018 work in a number of ways and also reported how much of the compound was produced, says metabolic engineer Sang Yup Lee of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, senior author of the work.

Among other things, the scientists were able to build a biosynthetic pathway in which every step was known (unlike the Aspergillus work with its unknown fungus enzyme). For the last step in the pathway, they used an enzyme from a plant instead of one from the cochineal bug. When the process still wasn’t producing carminic acid, the team conducted computer modeling studies to predict structural changes in some of the enzymes that would enhance the efficiency of the biosynthetic pathway. Then they introduced those changes by making precise mutations in the genes.

Finally, starting with glucose — which can be produced from renewable biomass — they successfully produced carminic acid.

While the scale of the experiment was tiny, the scientists calculated that if it were scaled up, and assuming production of 5 grams of carminic acid per liter, growing the engineered E. coli for five days in a 100,000-liter fermenter could produce as much carminic acid as cochineal bugs growing on prickly pear pads would produce on a hectare (almost 2.5 acres) of land in a year.

Frandsen says the two studies show that it’s possible to create novel biosynthetic pathways without directly copying the pathway used in nature (although he’d still like to uncover the biochemical processes that the cochineal insects use to make carminic acid). “Both show that synthetic biology has a great potential for the future,” he says.

There is still a lot of work to do before the process could be scaled up to industrial levels, the scientists add. Researchers need to fiddle with the amounts or efficiency of the various enzymes engineered into the microbes to optimize the production of carminic acid and reduce the amounts of undesired byproducts. Nonetheless, Frandsen and Lee say that companies are already taking interest, although they would not disclose names.

Making carminic acid this way could quell consumer concerns about animal products and possible allergies, but some may still balk over fears about genetically modified foods. Still, Lee says, “we hope that consumers around the world who care for the environment and health … will actively consume food and cosmetics containing microbially produced carminic acid. With our additional effort and time, we think we can get there in the near future.”

As for those prickly pear cacti in their plantations, ready to be fed to sucking cochineals to fatten them before their demise — Portillo Martinez reckons they’ll stick around to some extent regardless, due to long-standing local traditions.

“There are many, many areas that use the cochineal,” he says. “I think its production will remain. Maybe not the amount we have now — but I think it will remain.”

Start-up ‘beats the blues’ with spirulina-based food colouring for hot and cold beverages,"The colour blue is rare in nature, and as such, the pigment has been highly sought after – in textiles and paints alike – for millennia.

An ‘eye-catching’ and ‘exciting’ colour, blue has also proved an attractive hue for food and beverage makers. In the drinks category, well-known blue drinks range from blue lagoon cocktails to berry-flavoured soft drinks, blue lattes and functional sports beverages.

As the clean label trend continues apace, consumers are increasingly looking to avoid artificial synthetic colorants. But in the blue category, whether synthetic or natural, Israeli start-up Gavan says both face the same problem.

“Both synthetic blue dyes and plant-based blue colouring have regulatory, stability, intensity, or price challenges,” ​explained Yael Leader, head of product for Gavan.

“The main barrier to creating food formulations with natural colours is stability – the ability to overcome formulation challenges and ensure vibrant and consistent true blue throughout the product’s shelf life.” ​

While delivering a health-stable, naturally derived, vibrant blue for products with low pH is ‘tricky’, as any heat treatment or shift in pH can influence the colour’s shade, Gavan believes it has found the solution in spirulina.

Phycocyanin pigment-protein​

A type of blue-green algae, spirulina contains a pigment-protein known as phycocyanin, which produces a pure blue colour.

Gavan’s proprietary, non-GMO technology extracts phycocyanin and optomises the colourant ‘gently, without damaging the source, and enables the extraction of multiple compounds from the whole spirulina, without waste.

The result is a stable, blue colourant developed from technology that protects it from fading, event at pH as low as 3.0 or when pasteurised at 90°C for 30 seconds, noted the start-up.

“In addition, the platform’s control over particle size offers improved stability throughout the final product’s shelf life.” ​

Fortified drink potential​

Gavan says its platform allows for a ‘full spectrum’ of stable shades of blue, but as blue is a primary colour, it also ‘opens a window’ to producing other colours, from non-chlorophyll green to purple shades.

The start-up’s natural colouring formulation can be used for hot beverages, such as tea and coffee, as well as functional drinks and sports drinks.

“We have experienced quite a hearty demand from companies who are saying their consumers are looking for new experiences They have expressed a desire to widen their colour palates and are becoming more adventurous,” ​Itai Cohen, CEO and co-founder of Gavan, told FoodNavigator.

“This has spurred a growing demand for natural colours, whether blue or green, primarily for categories like functional beverages such as sports drinks and energy drinks and even cocktails.” ​

However, within the functional beverage category, when a large amount of vitamins and minerals can be added, ingredients can react with pigments and accelerate the colour degradation process.

This can cause fading, or create a complex binding of pigments and minerals that can deposit sedimentation in the final application, we were told.

Gavan’s platform provides a solution for the fortified beverages sector, amongst others.

From a clean label perspective, the colourant is marked as ‘spirulina extract’ on ingredients lists. “It complies with FDA-21 CFR US code of federal regulation code title 21,” ​said Cohen.

“The colouring principle complies with section 75.530 spirulina extract.” ​",,[],['Flora Southey']
"Michroma takes fungal food colors platform to pilot scale to produce pH-stable, heat-stable natural red","Michroma, which has offices in Argentina and San Francisco, CA, has identified filamentous fungi strains that naturally produce a target color, and deployed CRISPR gene editing technology to create proprietary, non-GMO industrial strains with superior yield and performance, explained co-founder and CEO Ricky Cassini, who worked as a professor of operations and logistics before teaming up with fellow academic Mauricio Braia in 2019.

“He's a PhD in biological sciences and he has a lot of experience in the industry working with industrial biotech to produce ingredients valorizing industrial waste and scaling up industrial bio processes,”​ he told FoodNavigator-USA.

“He told me about his crazy idea of making food dyes using fungi and I fell in love with it…”​

‘Scaling up from lab scale to pilot scale is often an area where synbio fermentation companies fail’​

Fed with low-cost feedstocks in bioreactors, the fungi secrete colors into the media where they are growing, added Cassini, “so​ we don't have to break the cell to extract the color, which makes the downstream process way cheaper and simpler. It’s a simple filtration process and then the color is dried or concentrated.”​

So what happens to the biomass that’s left over after the color has been harvested? “It has a high content of protein with all the essential amino acids and fiber that still retains a little bit of color, which makes it a very interesting byproduct for processed meat companies and plant-based meat companies,” ​said Cassini.

“Scaling up from lab scale to pilot scale is often an area where synbio fermentation companies fail, so we are really proud that we have scaled up to pilot scale with a CMO partner in Argentina, and we are in discussions with several CMOs here in the US and the rest of the world to scale up to industrial scale.”​

The main attraction of Michroma's red color is performance, says co-founder Ricky Cassini. 'It’s the pH and thermal stability, the coloring power, and the fact that it doesn't have a strong flavor...' Image credit: Michroma

Fungi make for better bio factories…​

While it’s not that unusual anymore to produce colors, flavors and sweeteners from microbes in fermentation tanks – several colors are now made using algae, yeast or bacteria, for example – ​fungi is more challenging, he said.

“There are some companies working with fungi, but it was really hard to edit fungi before CRISPR, so we think there is a huge opportunity to replace the bio factories that we are currently using such as yeast and bacteria, with modern bio factories created by fungi that are much more sophisticated microorganisms and are great at producing small molecules.” ​

Unlike algae such as spirulina (used to produce blue colors), meanwhile, Cassini’s fungi strains “don’t need light to grow,” ​he added.

“We are using the same platform to produce orange and yellow, with samples already in the market, and we want to expand this platform to produce other colors such as blue and green that are more difficult to find in nature with good stability.”​

Challenges in the natural red color market​

Natural colors are improving all the time, said Cassini. However, delivering a heat-stable, light-stable, naturally derived, vibrant red hue in products with neutral to higher pH remains very challenging if you want to avoid carmine (crushed Cochineal insects), which is not vegan, vegetarian, halal or kosher, and can put many buyers off.

Alternatives such as tomato lycopene work well in dairy, but it’s not the kind of rich deep vibrant red you’d need for a red velvet cake; while beets – which can have an earthy flavor – work at a neutral to basic pH ranges, but are not very heat stable, and can turn brown.

Anthocyanins from grapeskin and juice, elderberry, purple and black carrot, purple sweet potato, red cabbage and red radish can work well in lots of applications such as beverages, in turn, but once the pH starts to rise they can change color from red to purple to blue.

‘It can survive spray drying, extrusion, and pasteurization’​

Michroma’s vegan, kosher and halal red, however, is far more versatile, can work across a wide pH range, and is stable at high temperatures, enabling it to be used in everything from beverages, candy, ice cream, gummies and yogurt to red velvet cake, a notoriously challenging application area, said Cassini.

“It can survive spray drying, extrusion, and pasteurization. And one gram of our colorant has 58 times more coloring power than beet, the usage ​[dose] is really, really low.”​

Asked about light-stability, he said: “Our color is as stable as other natural colorants to light, but we are making progress on improving this.”​

The attraction for food formulators: pH and thermal stability, coloring power, and lack of flavor​

So what’s the key attraction for formulators?

The main attraction is performance, he said. “It’s the pH and thermal stability, the coloring power, and the fact that it doesn't have a strong flavor, which is something that they hadn't seen in the industry before.​

“And then there is the sustainability factor, it’s not petroleum-based and it doesn’t require all the agricultural land, water, and pesticides to grow plants ​[just to extract color from them]. We can also produce it anywhere in the world.”​

Color additive petition to be submitted to the FDA in 2022​

Michroma, which is backed by a handful of seed investors including SOSV, is planning to launch a new round of investment in Q1 2022, said Cassini, who is now based in San Francisco.

As for the regulatory pathway to market, Michroma plans to submit a color additive petition to the FDA next year (the colors will be color additives exempt from certification), and is working with a regulatory consultant in the US to nail down how they might be listed on the ingredients list.

“We​ believe we are going to have really appealing labeling. We can't share it right now, but we will after discussions with the FDA. It’s also important to note that it's not going to be considered GMO in Europe or the US.”​

Michroma's red color can be used in everything from beverages, candy, ice cream, gummies and yogurt to red velvet cake. Image credit: Michroma

The go-to-market strategy​

So what’s the go-to-market strategy?

“We believe the partnership route is the best option,” ​said Cassini, ​who said he has been approached by some large players since the company first emerged from stealth mode.

“We want to scale up fast, so we are actively looking for collaborations with ingredients suppliers, because they have sales teams and distribution.”​",,[],['Elaine Watson']
Tagra Re-boots Cosmetics with DeeperCaps,"DeeperCaps are encapsulated pigments dedicated to darker skin tones, which adhere to skin and give coverage with a natural color match without a white-cast effect.

Tagra Biotechnologies has created its DeeperCaps, which are encapsulated pigments dedicated to darker skin tones. This innovation will be showcased at in-cosmetics Global 2022.

Previously: Tagra Delivers Vitamin A Benefits with Microencapsulation, CelluCap A

As the company explains, because of the double-layer microcapsule structure, when the capsules are broken, the pigments adhere to skin and give coverage with a natural color-match but without a white-cast effect. The microencapsulation technology works in different forms such as gel, liquid, powder and cream-based makeup/skin care products.

Nurture Soap opens a local retail location,"Huntington now has a new option for locally-owned, small-business shopping, thanks to the opening of the Nurture Soap Store and Handmade Studio.

According to Store Manager Renee Voght, Nurture Soap got its start in 2012 with Carrie and Damian Thornsbury. A few years later, the company opened a warehouse on Swan Street in Huntington. Then, on Aug. 14 of this year, the retail location opened at 2809 Theater Ave., Huntington.

“We wanted to stay in Huntington – that was a big thing,” Voght said of the retail location. “We wanted to keep it local.”

According to the Nurture Soap website, Carrie has been making soap and bath and body products since 2004, which eventually led her to create the company – and every single product “has been stringently tested by her with a soap maker’s perspective.”

The retail store offers a wide variety of products, for both soap makers and enthusiasts alike. Whether someone is looking for products to start creating their own soap at home, or just want to pick up a locally-crafted bath item, there are options available at the Nurture Soap Store and Handmade Studio. Crafting items include soap molds, fragrances and colorants, as well as soap cutters – all of which are put together by hand at the Nurture Soap warehouse location in Huntington. The colorants are all mica powder mixed with pigment powder and vary widely in color options.

“Carrie wanted to open up a retail store so that customers could come in and actually smell the fragrances, see the colorants… and actually, physically see the products here,” Voght said. “We have soap and bath bombs made here in house as a bonus.”

There are different methods to soap making, such as melt-and-pour in which the products are melted, fragrances and colorants are added and then the products are able to harden in mere hours. Then, there is also the cold process method – which takes “about six weeks” to complete. All of the soap that is sold in-house is made with the cold process method.

There are also bath bombs and bath salts made in-house for purchase, and each item has its own name to go along with the special scent and colorant combination. For instance, the bath bomb called “First Love” is one of the first scent combinations that Carrie “fell in love with” when she was making the products.

The store also partners with Pathfinder Services. Members of Pathfinder Services use Nurture Soap fragrances in their candles and wax melts. The store then sells some of the finished Pathfinder products on their shelves.

Soon, customers will also have the option of signing up for soap making classes at the studio. Although there are still some details that need to be worked out before the classes are up and running, Voght stated that more information will be available on the store Facebook page and there will also be local advertising to alert interested parties as to how they should sign up for the classes. Classes will cover different soap making processes and will be available for folks of any skill level.

“We might have some guest soap makers, too,” Voght said. “There are a lot of soap makers online that do videos, so we might have guests come in and teach the class.”

Shoppers have the option of signing up for the retail store’s rewards program, in which a $5 credit is earned for every $50 that is spent. The retail store is open Tuesday through Friday, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and on Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. They are closed on Sunday and Monday.",,[],[]
Mulch Production Propels New York Soil and Gravel Business Forward,"- Advertisement -

EAST AMHERST, New York – The mulch business has helped propel C.J. Krantz Organics forward for about the past 10 years, and its Cheetah mulch coloring system from Mulch Mfg. has played no small part in the company’s success. The company is approaching the point of adding a second grinder to increase production.

Krantz Organics, located just east of Buffalo, New York, sells about 40,000 cubic yards of colored mulch annually and about 25-30,000 yards of soil products and compost. The busiest months for mulch sales usually are April-June. “By July Fourth, people usually are done with mulching,” said Nate Drollette, production manager.

Krantz Organics sells the majority of its products wholesale. Customers include landscape contractors, building contractors, and local governments. Some customers, like nurseries and some landscapers, turn around and sell them at retail. Customers are within about a 100-mile radius.

The company has two sites. In the town of Clarence the company owns 80 acres of farm land for topsoil. The working area is about 13 acres. Operations include a screening plant and product holding areas. The site is mainly used to produce topsoil and various blended soil products. It has an office, a shop, and a 4,000 yard storage building.

The company acquired a second site in East Amherst, five miles to the east, in 2012. It was owned by the town of East Amherst and was used to collect green waste and grind the material into mulch. It comprises 26 acres, including 13 paved acres. Krantz Organics continues to use it as a tipping yard for green waste, wood material, and soil and gravel. All mulch production is done at this site, which also has an office, a maintenance shop, and a storage barn. The location also serves as the company’s headquarters.

During the warm weather months, when the business can conduct operations, it employs about 10 people at each location. The company pretty much closes down from December through April with only four people on the payroll. Some employees take the time off. For others who want to work, Nate helps them find work plowing snow.

Krantz Organics is a family business owned and operated by Tim Krantz and his wife, Kim. The business was launched by Tim’s paternal grandfather, Chester Krantz, and a great-uncle, William Krantsz, in 1939. They started out delivering topsoil in the summer and firewood in the winter. When Chester retired in 1990, Tim’s father, Tom, took over the business. Tom was stricken with brain cancer and died at age 52 in 1999.

Tim and Kim took over the business when his father passed away. He was well prepared since he grew up in the business and worked in it since a teenager. A devout Christian, Tim has grown the business by adding more topsoil products, blending topsoil with peat moss, compost, and organic material, and mulch.

Tim is very ‘hands-on,’ according to Nate. If an equipment operator is out, Tim will be in the field, running a machine like anyone else. Otherwise, he is bidding jobs to sell products or looking for new sources of topsoil.

Tim began mulch production operations in 2010. At first he hired a contractor with a grinder to bring the machine to his property to grind material, and he bought a small coloring system to add color to mulch. Later he invested in a grinder with a coloring system.

Just two years later, with the growth of the market for mulch, he bought the town of East Amherst facility, including its Diamond Z 8000 tub grinder. Mulch is now a high priority of the business. “It’s become the top end of the business,” said Nate. Numerous contractors and municipalities bring their green waste, wood debris and tree trimmings to the site to unload, providing plenty of raw material. The wood yard also generates revenue as the company charges tipping fees for unloading wood.

Tim invested in a Cheetah mulch coloring system from Mulch Mfg. in 2016. The previous equipment did the double or second grind and colored mulch at the rate of 75-100 yards per hour, and Tim wanted to increase production, so he began looking at options. He experimented with doing a double grind with the tub grinder and decided he wanted a coloring system, not another grinder with coloring capability. Eventually he went to Pennsylvania to see a Cheetah in action.

Tim and Nate were attracted to the Cheetah for one reason because it uses trommel screen mechanics in the coloring process versus a system of paddles to turn and mix the mulch. “Since we have a lot of trommel screeners, we like the idea of trommels. We’re familiar with the mechanics of it,” noted Nate.

The Cheetah feeds the mulch using a trommel system, sprays the colorant and water, and mixes it all the way down the trommel, noted Nate. “It’s basically the same kind of process for screening soil and compost. It was easy to grasp how it worked.”

Another factor they looked at was consistency in the coloring process. “We wanted to make sure we could make the best product so we could stay at the top of the game,” said Nate.

“The production seemed very fast,” said Nate. “And the coloring process was consistent.

Once it’s up and running, you don’t have to change any settings.” Their Cheetah system colors at the rate of 180-300 yards per hour, he said.

The company also switched to the brand of liquid colorant produced by Mulch Mfg.: Nature’s Reflections.

The Cheetah makes better, more efficient use of colorants, uses less water, and produces a lighter finished product, according to Jeff Merlin, sales manager for Nature’s Reflections — all while requiring less energy to run than other mulch coloring systems. The rotating trommel system is less prone to jamming or damage. It can produce 50-350 yards per hour. With its rapid, high-volume production, longevity and low operating costs, it will provide a high return on investment.

Nature’s Reflections colorants are available in nine colors with 85 shades of each color. The company employs a full-time chemist to match colors of competitors. Only the most advanced raw materials are used. Pigment suppliers are held to extreme tolerance limits for color properties, particle size, purity and uniformity to provide maximum tint strength, and rigorous durability. An additive developed by the company boosts pigment for robust colors. Nature’s Reflections colorants — available in shades ranging from jet black to harvest gold — use only the most concentrated and easily dispersed ingredients while the high quality binders increase color longevity and ensure maximum customer satisfaction.

The Mulch Mfg. quality control department performs a battery of tests on every batch of products to ensure consistency and maximum quality. Colorants are tested for color strength, viscosity, pH, grin, solid percentage, weight per gallon, and color approval.

Nature’s Reflections colorants are safe for use near plants and animals. They are non-hazardous and are exempt from hazardous waste registration. There are no restrictions regarding disposal of empty containers.

(For more information about the Cheetah mulch coloring system or Nature’s Reflections colorants, visit www.natures-reflections.net, contact Jeff Merlin at jmerlin@mulchmfg.com, or call (724) 221-0471.)

“It’s really the best colorant we’ve found,” said Nate, although there are a lot of colorant products that are similar. “It’s super consistent and easy to get. We don’t have to wait.” Mulch Mfg. has manufacturing operations in Jacksonville, Florida, and a distribution facility in Ohio. “For us it comes down to the customer service and the consistency of the coloring process. It’s been super good since we started in 2016.”

Krantz Organics makes only two types of colored mulch — black and brown. Black is the best-selling color by a 3:1 ratio. “We’ve tried a couple of other colors in the past, but we’ve stayed with these two,” said Nate. It also produces a natural, uncolored mulch. All mulch products are made from hardwood, and all go through a double-grind process.

A Volvo EC210 excavator is used to feed the tub grinder. In addition to the excavator, the company has a Cat 329E excavator, five wheel loaders, three bulldozers, three McCloskey trommels, a SCARAB windrow turner for turning compost, and seven dump trucks for deliveries.

When mulch production starts up each year, “We grind every day,” said Nate, sometimes six days per week.

Topsoil production and sales vary throughout the year. “They always will,” said Nate, adding, “We’ll always be a topsoil company.”

The company plans to replace the motor in the Diamond Z tub grinder this year; the motor has 9,200 hours on it. It has undergone significant refurbishing and maintenance in the past 18 months.

Mulch sales continue to increase every year, said Nate. Since the company also uses the grinder for processing compost, it is considering adding a second machine, and Tim and Nate already have begun researching manufacturers.

Although wood grinding operations can continue through the winter, coloring mulch is seasonal. The company starts up coloring operations as soon as the weather is warm enough and there is no more danger of freezing — typically in late March. “Western New York doesn’t always cooperate with the mulch business,” said Nate. “The springs can be rainy.” Coloring operations halt in early September.

Most other mulch producers in the region do not perform all the processing operations in-house, according to Nate. “We’re getting raw wood material and turning it into a refined product. Our double-grind product is as good as some companies that do a triple-grind.”

The company has a website and also is active in other marketing strategies. It emails a flier to customers and potential customers every year and also does some radio advertising in the summer. It also has commercials that air on a local television show called Hammer Time that is geared to the construction industry, contractors, and do-it-yourself homeowners. The company’s trucks are painted a bright yellow with signage to stand out as they travel throughout the region.",,[],[]
Inorganic Color Pigment Market to Reach US$ 10.1 Billion by 2030: TMR,"Transparency Market Research’s (TMR) recent report on the global inorganic color pigments market estimates that the global market wil reach US$ 10.1 billion by 2030.The demand for construction materials has been increasing across the globe, owing to continuous rise in demand for housing triggered by growth in the global population.

Fujifilm gets $1.6M grant for plant expansions,"NEW CASTLE – Fujifilm received $1.64 million in taxpayer-backed grants Monday to support its two expansions underway in New Castle.

Last month, Fujifilm announced its second expansion in less than two years, investing another $28 million to add more inkjet printing capacity to its site off Cherry Lane in New Castle.

That investment comes on the heels of a $19 million production plant for pigment dispersions, a colorant for water-based pigment inkjet inks, that it started building last year and expects to bring online this summer. That project is Fujifilm’s first dispersion manufacturing facility in the U.S., with current production completed in Europe.

The Japanese multinational conglomerate perhaps best known for its photography products has operated an inkjet production site near the Delaware Memorial Bridge since 2006, although the site has been home to manufacturing back to the ’40s. Its latest investments by subsidiary Fujifilm Imaging Colorants Inc. will triple its global production capacity of pigment dispersions.

“We’ve definitely suffered with a decrease in [the home printing] market but what is coming is the more industrial market – printing of things like magazines, commercial printing, displays, signs, textiles, food packaging, flexible packaging, labels and industrial products,” Melissa Toledo, general manager of the New Castle plant, told the state’s investment board, the Council on Development Finance (CDF), on Monday.

Such water-based inks are a rapidly growing market because they can be utilized in a variety of applications and are also environmentally safe, able to be used in food packaging and cheaper than previous technologies.

The addition of pigment dispersions to the inks creates more consistent, fully featured colors and applications, but the technology to produce them is intensive. While pigment particles are incredibly small, in ink they can aggregate and sink, causing blockages in nozzles that apply the ink. Dispersions keep the particles separate and stable for use in their applications.

“Some of these industrial printers are as big as a city bus, for example, so being able to have high throughput is very, very important,” Toledo explained.

Fujifilm uses its unique RxD (reactive dispersant) technology not only for its own inks, but also supplies to ink manufacturers around the world – in fact, one of its largest previous customers was a rival company, Toledo said. It currently only produces the RxD dispersions at its Scotland facility but will branch into the U.S. with the new Delaware investment.

Construction on the 11,000-square-foot facility began last month and is expected to be operational by the summer of 2023, officials said. The pair of facilities brings Fujifilm’s recent investments in the First State to nearly $46 million.

“A lot of our customers think we can’t build these plants fast enough at this point. They’re really desperate for us to get up and running, which is very exciting,” Toledo added.

To support that expansion, Fujifilm was unanimously approved for more than $1.64 million in taxpayer-backed grants by the CDF. That includes funding to support the plant expansion, as well as to hire 32 new workers. The plant previously employed about 75 people.

The roles would include 10 professional or managerial roles, and 22 engineering or skilled labor roles, with a minimum annual salary of $50,000, according to officials.

While Fujifilm’s Delaware operation has traditionally had a global customer base with a small U.S. segment, Toledo said the company was looking to increase its customers regionally as well as in the South American and Latin American markets.",,[],"['Patricia Rivera', 'Delaware Prosperity Partnership']"
How These Founders Are Detoxifying the Denim Industry--and Saving the Planet,"About 20 percent of the world's industrial water pollution comes from textile dyeing. And the denim industry is the worst offender: Most mass-market denim brands rely on petroleum-based dyes and chemicals like formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide. In 2019, that reality inspired Tammy Hsu and Michelle Zhu to start Huue, which they spun out of Hsu's grad school work at the University of California at Berkeley, where she developed dyes made from microbial secretions. Huue is working on the launch of its first dye, a natural-but-synthetic indigo. The company's eight scientists are also developing sustainable dyes and colorants to disrupt other parts of the fashion industry. --As told to Hannah Wallace

ZHU: My parents were entrepreneurs in the apparel industry. Their brand focused on urban streetwear in the late '90s and early 2000s, which was why denim was such a large focus. As a child, I would visit garment manufacturing facilities on summer trips to China and witness the pollution firsthand: particles in the air that workers had to guard against with facemasks, and foul-looking waterways around the factories. It made a lasting impression on me.

HSU: I came at it from studying science and biology. The lab I was in was very entrepreneurial -- we were all thinking about how we could apply these solutions to real-world problems. I'm interested in fashion, clothes, and textiles. The more I read about it, the more I realized that this is a huge problem in the industry.

ZHU: Until the turn of the 20th century, indigo was made from plants. Natural indigo is not very cost effective or scalable, and its performance and color consistency doesn't fit industrial needs. Today, it is generally created via petrochemicals. Fossil fuels are used at the source of creation, but the industry also relies on toxic chemicals such as formaldehyde and benzene -- which not only pollute the planet but are carcinogenic as well. That's the main challenge we're tackling.

HSU: We look at how the indigo plant makes the indigo dye molecule. Then we take that genetic information and instruct our microbes to make indigo the same way. We're growing these microbes, and they're programmed to secrete the indigo.

ZHU: Microbes are truly amazing -- they multiply rapidly. We call them nature's most powerful manufacturers.

HSU: Six years ago, my professor at Berkeley had a grant, and a story was written about our project. When people learned we were working on sustainable indigo, brands started inquiring.

ZHU: We'd just hired our team of scientists and everyone was so excited to get to work last year. And then it was all shut down. Our milestones are lab-based, so not being able to go into the facility for three months created all sorts of uncertainty. Then there was the issue of when we could run productions and supply products. We were fortunate to win a female founders competition hosted by Microsoft's M12 fund, Mayfield, and Melinda Gates's Pivotal Ventures. That gave us an extra million dollars, which was a big help in the midst of Covid. Finally in July 2021, we brought the whole (vaccinated) team back into the lab full time.

HSU: We've made a lot of progress to scale up our production with a couple of facilities around the U.S. and to make our microbes more efficient. In August, we were producing 80 times more dye than at the end of last year. Our partners want huge amounts of dye.",,[],[]
25 years of innovation,"During an online panel discussion with Crystal Mier and Paul Edward, the founders/owners of Chef Rubber, based in Las Vegas, the company owners reflected on Chef Rubber’s 25 years in business and how to leverage current trends in the cake decorating segment. The discussion was part of the FIT Symposium 2022 organized by Johnson & Wales University’s College of Food Innovation Technology.

Not only does Chef Rubber offer additives, colorants, ingredients, flavorings, literature, tools, and supplies, the company recognizes the importance of dependability, accuracy, and timeliness that world-class chefs and artists require from their vendors.

“Our story begins with silicone, cocoa butter, and two chefs wanting to change the meaning of artisan chocolates and pastry. Eight colors of cocoa butter and food grade silicone changed the world of confections and pastry. Twenty-five years later we’re still here, pushing the boundaries of color and inspiration,” Chef Rubber’s owners said. “It’s a lot of hours, and there are no days off, especially in the beginning.”

“From the beginning, we really tried to see what the market needed,” Edward added. “Our business continues to evolve as the market changes. Today, we have over 7,000 products.”

Supply constraints have emerged as a No. 1 challenge in the age of COVID, he explained, and Chef Rubber wisely had planned ahead for certain environmental concerns like shipping with cornstarch packing peanuts and using recycled materials.

“We just acquired a large solar panel system, and we are generating a lot of our own electricity,” Edward said. “We decided to be more self-sufficient. We have a facility in Las Vegas with super-efficient air conditioning and now a new Park City (Utah) distribution center.”

Staying ahead of marketplace trends remains a key focus of their operations. Plant-based options, for instance are a growing trend.

Chef Rubber food colors are available in multiple forms – from powder, to liquid, gel, and paste. Which to choose will depend on the dessert, confection or beverage that is being created. The two main categories in colors for the food industry are water soluble and fat dispersible (lakes and dyes). A water-soluble colorant works best when the water content in the recipe is higher than the fat content. The best example would be when making macaron batter – the most common selection is a gel or water-based powder color that is easily mixed with the water content in the egg whites. Similarly, a fat dispersible color added to a fat-bases product like chocolate will work significantly better than adding a water-soluble colorant.

The creative mind and pastry knowledge of the Chef Rubber founders have developed and launched a full line of natural colorants. These products are derived from vegetables, fruits, herbs, and spices. Chef Rubber has natural options in both water-based and fat-based colorants.

“Plant-based products are here to stay,” Edward said, “but I think you have to look at where you are located and who is your mix of clients. You need to respond to what your customers want.”",,[],[]

Supply Chain Concerns





Superior Daylight Fluorescent Colorants for Printing Ink Applications Superior Daylight Fluorescent Colorants for Printing Ink Applications

Pigments and dyes supply the color we see in our everyday lives, whether it is textiles, cars, homes and so much more. For ink manufacturers, pigments create the unique packaging and publications consumers notice. For ink manufacturers, pigments play such an important role . First and foremost, they must meet regulatory standards.“INX is always looking for pigments that are easier to process, require less energy to disperse and are heavy metal free,” said Mark Hill, SVP of R&D for INX International Ink Co . “This is important in order to conform with the constantly changing landscape of regulatory concerns brought to us by customers, brand owners, NGO’s, and others.”“Regulatory compliance is a given,” said Sun Chemical CTO Russell Schwartz. “Sun Chemical seeks pigments that go beyond compliance and achieve the lowest practical levels of any substances that are perceived to be unhealthy or environmentally unattractive. Sun Chemical also strives to ensure that the pigments it buys are produced as sustainably as possible and without child labor. We strongly believe that supply is more secure when manufacturers adhere to these principles. Pigments that streamline manufacturing due to ease of handling are also preferred.”“As food packaging is an important market for hubergroup, it is essential for us that pigments are compliant with the corresponding regulatory requirements,” hubergroup said.Innovation and service are also critical in selecting a pigment manufacturer.“INX is a technology driven company and we always want to partner with suppliers that offer innovation,” said Rick Westrom, INX SVP of strategic sourcing. “Service is also a key driver, especially with today’s supply chain challenges.”“It’s worth noting that innovation and service come in many forms,” Schwartz said. “Service can include on-time delivery in clean, undamaged packaging or being able to provide specific information that is normally not included in a certificate of analysis. There are also many levels of innovation which impact the working properties of pigments. It could include the amount of NIAS (non-intentionally added substances) or how the pigment impacts the press speed that an ink can achieve.”hubergroup noted that when it comes to sourcing pigments, availability is currently the most relevant factor.“Additionally, costs, quality consistency and food packaging approval play a significant role,” hubergroup added. “Service is especially important to us in the context of food packaging requirements as we expect easy access to all relevant documents and information regarding regulatory aspects. Of course, we always keep up to date with innovations as well, but not much has happened in this respect in the pigments sector in recent years.”Ink manufacturers say that sustainability is an important factor when selecting pigment suppliers.“Sustainability is a very important consideration when it comes to sourcing pigments,” said Schwartz. “If a pigment supplier can demonstrate a sustainability advantage, then preferential consideration for that pigment will be given.”hubergroup believes that the sustainable use of resources is important and therefore pursues a holistic sustainability approach.“As there is little potential for renewable raw materials for pigments, we attach major importance to a manufacturing process that follows high environmental standards,” hubergroup reported. “Since a lot of water is needed during pigment preparation, we have a state-of-the-art water treatment facility at our pigment production site in India. This facility has a great environmental performance and allows us to reuse a large share of our wastewater with very low energy consumption. And, of course, we expect equally high environmental standards from our external pigment suppliers.”“Sustainability is important to INX in all facets of our company,” acknowledged Hill. “This includes raw materials we use so pigments are not overlooked. Sustainability has many definitions in manufacturing; it could mean bio-renewable content, energy efficient manufacturing, ecologically friendly produced products, or bio-degradable/compostable materials.”According to leading research analysts, the pigment market is sizable, and it is healthy.Nikhil Pampatwar, head - research & intelligence for Verified Market Research , places the size of the global pigment markets at more than $28 billion.“As per the estimates from Verified Market Research, the global pigment market stands at $28.85 billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.61% until year 2028, reaching a market value of $39.56 billion,” said Pampatwar. “The market growth is supported due to increased demand for pigments with functional benefits.“Organic pigments are being increasingly used to enhance aesthetics and the functional values in both paints and plastics,” Pampatwar added. “The plethora of color offered by organic pigments is also one of the prime factors driving the growth of the global organic pigments market.”Rahul Pandita, client partner for Persistence Market Research (PMR) , noted that PMR estimates the global organic pigments to be worth around $6.2 billion in 2021, while the inorganic pigments market is estimated to be nearly $20.1 billion for the year.Pandita reported that the pigment industry witnessed a double whammy of shrunken demand as well as supply side constraints during the pandemic, making it a painful period for the sector.“Pigment demand suffered significantly during the year 2020, especially as the automotive sector faced massive production halts as vehicle sales plummeted to unprecedented levels,” added Pandita. “Sliding demand from the construction sector only made the situation worse. On the supply side, early disruptions in production bases across China impacted whatever demand was available in other parts of the world. Even as demand started clawing back to normalcy during the last part of the year, raw materials price hikes squeezed margins.”According to Coherent Market Insights (CMI) , the global pigments market was valued around $16,669.9 million in 2020. Organic pigments accounted for 35.3% of total pigments market, while inorganic pigments accounted for 49.8% of the global pigment market in terms of value in 2020.“Growth of the global pigment market is primarily driven by high demand from the Asia Pacific region and this region accounted for nearly 42% of the global pigment demand in 2020,” CMI analysts reported.The analysts noted that there remain concerns about the availability and cost of key pigments and raw materials that help formulate these pigments, such as intermediates. They believe that these issues will continue into the near future.“Many industries were severely affected due to COVID-19 and it had also affected global pigment market,” CMI’s analyst reported. “Many countries had imposed strict lockdowns during various COVID-19 to limit the spread of the virus. In 2020, printing inks demand had been impacted to some extent due to the pandemic, but increased demand for packaging and labeling solutions for essential goods and food had enabled speedy recovery and limited the impact of the pandemic. Analysts from Coherent Market Insights have estimated fast recovery of global pigment market in 2021 and demand will reach pre-COVID level by first half of 2022.”“The volatility of raw material prices is one of the major factors restraining the growth of the pigments market,” said Pampatwar. “Anatase/rutile is the most commonly used raw material in the manufacturing of pigments (considering titanium dioxide pigments to form the major part of the pigments market). Synthetic rutile is a synthesized form of naturally occurring rutile ore. The price of this raw material is increasing due to the growing demand for titanium dioxide pigments.“Similarly, natural gas is a raw material used to produce carbon black,” added Pampatwar. “Owing to the recent shale gas boom in the US market, its prices are expected to remain low. In 2020, many players such as Sun Chemical, BASF SE, DIC Corporation, and Lanxess had increased the price of organic and inorganic pigments by 5-20%. Increase in the prices of titanium dioxide and carbon black in regions such as Europe, APAC, and North America after the impact of COVID-19 has also impacted the overall pigment market. Thus, fluctuating raw material prices result in volatility in final prices of pigments to be used by the end-use industries, which is restraining the demand for the pigment.”“Disruptions in the global shipping industry during the new year caused massive backlogs and longer wait time for customers, further hampering revenue realization. In summary, the pandemic year has been one which the industry would like to forget as quickly as possible,” Pandita concluded.Keith Jacques, associate consultant for Smithers , said that the pandemic led to a series of ongoing disruptions to the day-to-day operations of the pigment industry, its raw material suppliers, and its customers. He pointing to temporary closures of facilities as governments imposed lockdowns, inabilities to receive raw materials on time or deliver finished goods due to similar problems in the transportation sectors, and halting of almost all R&D work, with staff working from home either full time or for two to three days per week.As a result, prices across the board have increased, and continue to do so, as production schedules are extended and transportation of goods suffers from lack of containers and a shortage of truck drivers in Europe and North America.“There is a widespread acceptance over the inevitability of ever-rising prices and suppliers are finding little or no resistance from their customers to new increases,” Jacques said. “The problems with containers being in the wrong places is expected to be resolved by mid-2022, but the shortage of truck drivers will take much longer to resolve. As a result, delivery lead times will still be longer in 2022 than pre-pandemic, and prices are forecast to remain high throughout most of next year although the rates of increase may slow.”“As things stand at this point, pigment demand has recovered at a faster pace than previously thought owing to the pent-up demand and ‘catch up effect,’” Pandita said. “However raw material shortages and cost inflation is the Achilles’ heel that is projected to weigh down the industry in the short to medium term. More recently, unavailability and huge hikes in prices of key raw materials such as urea, coal, phthalic anhydride, cuprous chloride etc. led to shortages in the production and availability of blue pigments, impacting customers on a global level. The situation is expected to remain volatile in the near future as there are no easy fixes to these issues.”“There are different precursors or intermediates used for manufacturing of various pigments,” said CMI’s analyst. “Titanium dioxide, iron oxide, lead oxides, and chromates are major inorganic pigments. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) based pigments accounts for around two-thirds of pigment volume. In 2021, increasing demand for titanium dioxide and uncertainty of raw material availability has increased concerns.”“Increased transportation cost and higher freight rates have further raised concerns of companies in the pigment market,” added the CMI analyst. “The above reasons have contributed to an increase in cost of production and many companies have taken initiatives to hike pigment prices to increase profit margins.”Brilliant Group is focused on making it easy for companies to implement daylight fluorescent colors.

Avient writes the e-book on sustainability,"When it comes to sustainability, materials maker Avient Corp. wrote the book.

Actually, the Avon Lake, Ohio-based firm recently wrote a series of three e-books on sustainability that now are available on the company's web site.

""As climate change continues to be one of the defining issues of our time, a commitment to sustainable solutions is essential,"" officials wrote on the site. ""You're a big part of the solution, and we're here to support you as you shift from a linear economy to a circular economy. We know that designing sustainable solutions often comes with challenges and questions. That's why we created this series of e-books,"" they wrote.

One of the e-books is focused on recycled PET and covers topics including why the material is so popular, how it fits within the circular economy and what challenges it presents. Another e-book is about the circular economy and looks at a clear definition of that term, how the circular economy is relevant today and material solutions that support it. The third e-book is centered on lightweighting and composites and includes info on how lighter materials enable lower CO2 emissions and on key applications that can benefit from these materials.

Avient has been steadily commercializing new sustainable products. In early 2021, the firm launched Rejoin-brand post-consumer masterbatch colorants for polyolefin packaging. The colorants are made with post-consumer polyolefin as a carrier resin.

Avient is one of the world's largest concentrate makers and one of North America's largest compounders and resin distributors. The firm employs more than 8,000 worldwide and posted sales of about $3.2 billion in 2020.",,[],"['Frank Esposito', 'Senior Staff Reporter']"

Avient finds sustainable answers for customers,"Avient Corp. has been busy in 2021 commercializing new products that are sustainable while meeting customer needs.

Earlier this year, Avon Lake, Ohio-based Avient debuted Rejoin-brand post-consumer masterbatch colorants for polyolefin packaging. The colorants are made with post-consumer polyolefin as a carrier resin.

Officials said the material was developed in response to growing customer demand and is already being used by a major consumer products firm to achieve 100 percent post-consumer packaging on multiple personal care product lines.

ColorMatrix Optica-brand toners and colors also were launched earlier this year. Officials said that when added to PET and recycled PET materials, the toners and colors correct and reduce color variations and yellowing that occur during recycling.

Also added to the Avient lineup was ColorMatrix rePrize-brand IV Builder, a patented, liquid additive for recycled PET that increases the quality and performance of the material while reducing the energy needed to produce it.

Avient earlier this year worked with polyvinyl butral (PVB) products maker Shark Solutions on reSound R-brand recycled-content thermoplastic elastomers. Both new TPEs contain 25 percent post-consumer content from PVB reclaimed from broken automotive windshields and laminated architectural glass.

At the Fakuma 2021 trade show in Germany, Avient promoted its supplying of a recycled-content TPE Société Bic SA for use in a women's razor. The material has a soft, grippy feel and is highly colorable. It is formulated to achieve 62 percent recycled content, helping Clichy, France-based Bic live up to its sustainability promises.

Avient is one of the world's largest concentrate makers and one of North America's largest compounders and resin distributors. The firm employs more than 8,000 worldwide. For 2020, Avient was certified as a Great Place to Work by the Great Place to Work Institute.

Engineered Bacteria Produce a Rainbow of Colors,"Researchers have modified a common bacterium to spit out an entire rainbow of dyes for food, clothing, cosmetics, and more. The proof-of-concept research also detailed the natural production of two colors—green and navy blue—for the first time.

Some dyes can be produced naturally from plants. Indigo, for example, is extracted from leaves of species in the genus Indigofera. But the task is labor-intensive, with variable results. Synthetic alternatives can involve toxic precursors and by-products, sometimes released as pollutants. And consumers are willing to pay more for natural colorants, says Sang Yup Lee, a chemical and biomolecular engineer at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. So he and his colleagues set out to engineer Escherichia coli to make seven natural hues.

The researchers not only had to tweak the microbes by adding specific genes to produce the dyes, they also had to help the bacteria push the colors out into the world. Because the involved dyes are hydrophobic (water-repellent), they typically cannot pass through bacterial cell membranes; they would instead accumulate inside the cell and ultimately kill it. Synthetic biology researchers seeking to produce self-sustaining “cell factories” for chemicals have long been stymied by this problem.

Lee and his team genetically altered their E. coli, first to grow longer cells and then to convert some of the extra membrane surface area into sacs that could encircle and expel the accumulated chemicals. Rather than cutting out the relevant genes entirely, which might in some instances kill the bacteria, they introduced small RNA sequences that “silenced” such undesired but essential genes. They also inserted a human gene that caused the bacteria to form microscopic pouches on their membranes for even greater surface area. The complete process is described in Advanced Science.

Lee says that his E. coli production method has no toxic properties and could be incorporated into industry today—but that “some colors will be more expensive because the [concentrations] are still quite low and difficult to produce.”

The new technique could eventually help engineer microbes to produce hydrophobic antibiotics, says Duke University biochemist Meta Kuehn, who was not involved in the research. This capability “would be tremendous as far as a good source for producing some really difficult-to-synthesize antibiotics,” she says.

Lee has worked on metabolic engineering for 26 years and describes these rainbow food and clothing dyes as his latest forays into industrial chemical production—which have also included making compounds involved in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. It's a running joke among his colleagues, he adds with a smile, that his goal is to produce every compound in the chemists' go-to Sigma-Aldrich catalog.",,[],"['Maddie Bender', 'About The Author S', 'Credit', 'Nick Higgins.', 'Recent Articles Maddie Bender']"

Using Colors in Homemade Hand Soaps – Mother Earth News,"The way you incorporate color into your soap depends on the kind of soap and the kind of colorant you’re using. You can color the soap directly by adding the colorant to the soap mixture. You can also add pieces of colored soap as in the “chunking” and confetti techniques. Here, we’ll talk about how to use color in each of the soapmaking techniques.

Coloring Cold-Process Soap

When you’re working with cold-process soap, a number of colorants will fade, change, or disappear altogether due to their reaction to active lye. Natural plant dyes will be obliterated except for a few tenacious examples. Certain food colorants will change color entirely.

Fortunately, there are also many kinds of colors that will hold up through the rigors of the cold-process method. A few plant dyes, including some spices, produce colors ranging from subtle to bright. Ultramarines and oxides hold up very well, as do many micas.

Coloring Hot-Process Soap

In the hot-process techniques, you can add color after the soap is neutral, so you have more choices available than in cold process. You can often use less colorant, with more predictable results.

Getting colorants distributed evenly in hot-process soap is difficult. When you add color at the end of the cooking period, you are trying to add it to a very thick, sticky mixture. Some of the soap has cooled into tiny lumps, while some of it is fluid enough to accept the colorants.

Experiment with different ways of incorporating color into hot process. One thing to try is to remove a small portion of the mass you want to color, mix the colorant into that, and then mix the colored portion back into the rest. Give it, and yourself, a good workout trying to get the color evenly distributed.

In hot processing, and in fact all lye soapmaking techniques, you can add some color elements from the beginning of the process. You may use an infusion of an herb to mix with the lye, or you may use an oil that has been colored with herbs. These herbal infusions will usually take quite a beating in the process, but there are herbal colorants that transmit well this way.

Colors in Hot and Cold

With hot process, if the soap is still slightly alkaline, colorants that fade in alkaline soap will do the same here. Chances are about fifty-fifty that a colorant said not to be stable in cold process will be stable in hot.

You can also add mineral pigments to the early stages of making lye soap. Ultramarines and oxides perform beautifully when added with the lye to the water to make a tinted lye solution. Keep in mind that the entire batch will be that color. You can make two separate batches simultaneously using color in this way, and swirl them together, avoiding the complication of adding colorant later. You can also vary the color at the end with more colorant, or pieces of differently colored soap. Planning ahead pays off.

Coloring Casting Soap

Soap casting is where color really takes center stage. The premade soap base will accept just about any pigment. Herbs will eventually turn brown in any soap, but in soap casting, they’ll keep their color for a little while.

You can use different kinds of coloring together in the same projects. Combining liquid soap dye with a little mica makes a very simple and beautiful soapcasting project. Ultramarines and plant materials can be used together to great effect. Again, imagination is the key.

It doesn’t take much pigment for transparent soap to go from clear to opaque, or so saturated with color that little light goes through. Often, less is more. Take advantage of the beauty of the way light passes through the soap, especially with mica.

Enjoying Natural Color Sources

Nature provides us with beautiful colors that can be applied to coloring soap. You can add plant material directly to the soap mixture to create not only color but texture as well. Most plant material that starts out green will eventually turn brown. However, some botanicals–calendula petals, for example–retain their color when added at the end of the process. You can also use dried herbs in hand-milling products if you really want the color to stay for a while. Be sure that when you’re adding herbal ingredients directly into the soap, you remove sticks, twigs, and other sharp parts of the plant.

Volatile Oils

Highly sensitive individuals should avoid plants with lots of volatile oils such as rosemary, the mints, and even lavender. Look to herbal reference books for sensitivity information and remember that it is always wise to err on the side of caution.

To get the color from the plant matter into your soap, you can use a variety of methods. Infusing oil and water with a high concentration of the color herb creates a usable dye. Be sure to record the amounts, temperatures, and length of infusion time so you can repeat what works. There are a few commercially available plant dyes.

There are quite a few plants that work as colorants for soap, but annatto seed and alkanet root are some of the most easily used. Since plants vary from season to season and crop to crop, you should test each new supply you purchase.

A ‘greener’ alternative for red-colored smoke,"The red smoke of a flare on a roadway warns motorists to be cautious, but the anthraquinone dyes currently used to produce this smoke are thought to be harmful to human health. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering have identified a less toxic, “greener” alternative — an organic dye called pigment red 254 (PR254). It also forms a red-colored smoke cloud more effectively than current dyes, the researchers say.

Commercialized in 1986, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dyes are used as colorants in car paints (such as the famous “Ferrari red”), optics technologies and other applications. For the purpose of signal smokes, Vojtech Pelikan and colleagues chose the DPP dye PR254, which has a brilliant red color and is less toxic than anthraquinone dyes. In experiments, the researchers showed that a PR254-containing pyrotechnic composition reached a yield of red-colored smoke of 51%, compared with only 48% for the usual anthraquinone dye. PR254 was also more thermally stable than the reference dye, which might allow it to be used in a less toxic heat-generating system, according to the researchers.

"In the Catskills, a Textile Artist and Designer Creates Dyes From Her Own Garden","Christi Johnson first came to the botanical colorants after working in the fashion industry in Los Angeles. Turned off by the toxicity of conventional dyes, she began using natural ones that could be purchased or created from things she foraged, like black walnut hulls. After moving to New York City, where she took courses in natural dying at the Textile Arts Center, she eventually relocated to the Catskills, where she and her partner turned an overgrown weed patch into a thriving dye and vegetable garden.

Christi Johnson makes botanical dyes from plants grown outside her studio, Mixed Color, in Sullivan County, New York. She sells her fashions online, teaches workshops on textile arts and natural dyeing, and is the author of Mystical Stitches: Embroidery for Personal Empowerment and Magical Embellishment.

To Johnson, gardening and sewing are more similar than you’d think. ""Both require patience. You can’t make anything happen faster,"" she says. ""With embroidery I’ll have this image in my head, and no matter what, it’s going to take X number of hours to execute. And the garden is similar. I really want to grow madder root to dye things with, and that’s going to take me three years. It all serves as a regular reminder that rushing through life is kind of missing the point entirely."" Here, Johnson shares her favorite botanical dye sources, her laborious working process, and what it’s like to garden in the Catskills during torrential rains.

Dwell: What do you grow in your garden?

Johnson: I have been growing indigo since the beginning. Japanese indigo, or Persicaria tinctoria, does really well in New York State. Some people preserve the dried leaf and process it, but I use it in fresh leaf form. It’s an incredible shade of turquoise blue-green. You can’t get it anywhere else. I also grow marigold—an amazing garden and dye plant—weld, a biennial that produces a bright yellow dye, and woad. I also have vegetables with lots of flowers mixed in to keep the pollinators around—and because flowers are beautiful, of course.

Is there a good beginner dye plant?

Marigold flowers. They yield a bright yellow orange. It’s one of those dyes that actually look like the color of the flower. Hollyhock flowers are good, too, and they’re a pretty garden flower. The dark black hollyhocks are best.

Are there dye plants that grow in the wild that you forage?

Goldenrod, which produces a yellow dye. It’s an incredible self-spreader, and when my boyfriend and I moved here, we actually tried to eradicate it from our property. But there are still some stands of it left and I do use it for dye. I just have to chop it all down before it flowers and seeds all over the place. We also have a lot of mugwort growing on the property. In the early spring it yields a vibrant pale mint color, while in the fall it’s more like Band-Aid brown.",,[],['Meredith Mendelsohn']

Wild blue wonder: X-ray beam explores food color protein,"In food products, the natural blues tend to be moody.

A fun food colorant with a scientific name – phycocyanin – provides a vivid blue pigment that food companies crave, but it can be unstable when placed in soft drinks and sport beverages, and then lose its hues under fluorescent light on grocery shelves.

With the help of physics and the bright X-ray beams from Cornell’s synchrotron, Cornell food scientists have found the recipe for phycocyanin’s unique behavior and they now have a chance to stabilize it, according to new research published Nov. 12 in the American Chemical Society’s journal BioMacromolecules.

“Phycocyanin has a vibrant blue color,” said Alireza Abbaspourrad, the Youngkeun Joh Assistant Professor of Food Chemistry and Ingredient Technology in the Department of Food Science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “However, if you want to put phycocyanin into acidified beverages, the blue color fades quickly due to thermal treatment.”

The research, “Tuning C-Phycocyanin Photoactivity via pH-Mediated Assembly–Disassembly,” was authored by Ying Li, a doctoral student in food science; Richard Gillilan, staff scientist at the Macromolecular X-ray science at the Cornell High

Energy Synchrotron Source, or MacCHESS ; and Abbaspourrad.

Most food companies seeking blues in their food use synthetic food dye, Abbaspourrad said. Phycocyanin is a natural and more nutritional protein derived from algae, which is the main ingredient in spirulina, mostly sold in powder form at health food stores. The food scientists wanted to understand its color properties and how it worked.

Food science, meet physics. The researchers partnered with the Macromolecular Diffraction Facility of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) and used Size-Exclusion Chromatography coupled to Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SEC−SAXS) on a beamline.

Phycocyanin was placed into a biological fluid and brought to the MacCHESS laboratory. There, intense beamline X-rays were channeled into tiny drops of the fluid. The small-angle X-ray scattering showed that as pH levels, the molecular strands changed into different shapes, folds and assemblies.

“So as pH changes, the phycocyanin molecules form in different ways,” Li said. “If the pH goes up, the molecules come together and if the pH level goes down, the molecules disassemble.

“As we changed the environmental stimulus for the phycocyanin, the molecules modulate their behavior in terms of how they interact with light,” she said. “It's a relationship of the protein structure and the color stability.”

The acidity of the environment can essentially mediate an assembly-disassembly pathway, Abbaspourrad said. “Through the X-ray scattering we could see the proteins and see how their monomers are assembled together and how the oligomers disassemble,” he said. “That’s the root cause for how the blue color fades.”

This research was funded by U.S. Department of Agriculture (National Institute of Food and Agriculture), and CHESS is supported by the National Science Foundation, New York state, and the National Institutes of Health and its National Institute of General Medical Sciences.",,[],['Blaine Friedlander']
Argentinian Startup Creates Food Coloring From Fungi,"Michroma, Argentinian synbio firm is currently working on the production of fungi-based natural food colourings, a market dominated by synthetics and animal-derived products. The startup has developed a heat-stable vibrant red colour made from fungi through synthetic biology and fermentation technology.

The company’s co-founder and CEO Ricky Cassini said in an interview with Food Navigator that the firm leverages non-GMO filamentous fungi strains that can produce specific colours when fed with low-cost feedstocks in bioreactors. The fungi secretes the colours into the media where it grows, which is then filtered, dried and concentrated into a final product.

He added that the final product has a “high content of protein with all the essential amino acids and fiber that still retains a little bit of color, which makes it a very interesting byproduct for processed meat companies and plant-based meat companies.”

Michroma’s vibrant red colorant is vegan, kosher and halal, and can be used in beverages, candies, yogurts and baking mixes. It is also temperature-stable, and “can survive spray drying, extrusion, and pasteurization,” according to Cassini, making it a viable alternative for many companies in the food industry worldwide.

Michroma’s red colorant can become a substitute for currently-used red dyes made from carmine, a pigment derived from crushed beetles and cochineal insects. It also poses a big threat to other plant-based colorants: tomato-based lycopene isn’t as bright and beetroot is not heat-stable. Compared to beet-based red colors, Cassini states that Michroma’s colour intensity is around 58-times more, claiming that “The usage is really, really low.” This is also favorable for businesses that want to achieve sustainability goals while keeping their costs low.

Michroma is currently fueled by seed funding from the same investors behind Upside Foods, Perfect Day and NotCo. They plan to open a financing round in early 2022 for its expansion roadmap, and submit a colour additive petition to the FDA. After that, Michroma wants to sell its colourants through a B2B approach, partnering with food producers and ingredients suppliers.",,[],[]
