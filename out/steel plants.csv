EU climate targets: how to decarbonise the steel industry,"Reinvesting in existing CO 2 -intensive assets risks creating stranded assets (having to close down assets before the end of their economic and technical lifetime). The recently published REPowerEU plan reiterated and strongly emphasised the need to accelerate decarbonisation in the EU. Replacing coal, oil and natural gas in industrial processes will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and support international technology leadership.

A new report by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre shows that the EU steel industry is mainly focussing on hydrogen-based steelmaking as a decarbonisation strategy.

Meanwhile the industry is exploring carbon capture technologies, notably in partnership with the chemical industry, as a way to capture and use CO 2 emissions for the production of chemicals.

The report also describes recent efforts by industry players to decarbonise their steel production, draws together information on pilot projects and industry announcements on the deployment of breakthrough steelmaking technologies (hydrogen-based Direct Reduced Iron [DRI] carbon capture technologies and electrolytic reduction of iron ore), and discusses the associated costs and the role of R&D.

Decarbonisation strategies

CO 2 emissions and energy use in European steel production have already been halved since 1960, and the sector aims to achieve further cuts of 80-95% by 2050[2], compared to 1990 levels. Since the conventional Blast Furnace - Basic Oxygen Furnace production route is highly CO 2 -intensive (usually with a carbon footprint of 1.6-2.0 tonnes of CO 2 per tonne of crude steel produced) and most EU steel mills are operating close to optimum efficiency, the industry is increasingly focussing on hydrogen-based steelmaking to decarbonise the sector.

Several projects announced across Europe aim to replace existing steel production processes with new steel plants based on the direct reduction of iron using hydrogen. The REPowerEU plan highlights that around 30% of the primary steel production in the EU is expected to be decarbonised by 2030 using renewable hydrogen.

The cost

In the short-to-medium term, making low-CO 2 steel is likely to be more expensive than current steel production costs. The future costs of hydrogen-based steel production are highly uncertain, since they depend on the future costs of renewable hydrogen and electricity.

The report gathers and compares the results of several external studies that show that with a strong decrease in the costs of renewable hydrogen and an increase in the price of CO 2 emissions, hydrogen-based steelmaking could become competitive with current steelmaking costs by 2050.

Instruments such as carbon contracts for difference (highlighted in the report) could reduce the risks of deploying low carbon technologies by hedging the uncertainty in future carbon costs.

The major investment needed to deploy low-CO 2 steelmaking plants will however need to go hand in hand with investment in the infrastructure required to enable these solutions (renewable electricity and transmission networks, hydrogen related infrastructure or CO 2 transport and storage infrastructure).

The role of R&D

The EU’s ultra-low CO 2 steelmaking (ULCOS) programme, co-funded by the Commission, was instrumental in the early development of decarbonisation technologies for the steel industry. ULCOS brought together 47 partners across the European steel industry and research landscape, and was crucial for assessing and developing low-CO 2 process routes, which were then adopted by industry.

The report presents several indicators showing that the EU industry was a global leader in the early-stage development of technologies. EU R&D programmes played an important supporting role in their early development, but major investments are still needed to support first-of-a-kind demonstration and commercial deployment.

The Clean Steel Partnership, formally launched in June 2021, aims to bring a range of breakthrough technologies for clean steel production up to large-scale demonstration by 2030. The partnership estimates R&D investment needs up to 2030 to be around €2.6 billion. The partnership will be funded under both Horizon Europe and the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, with the EU contributing €700 million towards this mechanism.

The European Commission’s Innovation Fund, financed by the auction revenues of the EU Emissions Trading System, is expected to play an important role in supporting the demonstration of first-of-a-kind low-CO 2 plants.

As part of the REPowerEU plan, the Commission will also roll out carbon contracts for difference under the Innovation Fund to support a full switch of existing hydrogen production in industrial processes from natural gas to renewables and the transition to hydrogen-based production processes in new industrial sectors such as steel-making.

State aid rules on Important Projects of Common European Interest can further boost the implementation of these pilot decarbonisation projects. The European Commission is also facilitating action on research and technology innovation in industry through initiatives bringing together Member States, industry and the research community, such as the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and the ERA Common Industrial Technologies Roadmaps.

A paradigm shift

The report describes the recent paradigm shift among major industry players – globally and especially in the EU – to decarbonise steel production.

The five biggest steelmakers in the world, as well as all the biggest EU steelmakers, have announced decarbonisation targets. In parallel, there is evidence of an emerging market that is willing to pay a green steel premium, as automotive companies are announcing they will use low-CO 2 steel in their vehicle manufacturing. By implementing additional regulatory initiatives to create green markets, such as setting green steel standards and green public procurement, the EU has the opportunity to be a frontrunner in the production of low-CO 2 steel.

Background

The steel sector generates over 330 000 direct jobs and 2.5 million indirect jobs, making it a key part of the EU economy. Steel production in the EU is dominated by a handful of countries. Germany produced 26% of all EU steel in 2020, followed by Italy (15%), France (8%) and Spain (8%). Just over half of all steel produced in the EU in 2020 (56%) was made via the primary route and 44% was made through the recycling route.

Fourteen countries in the EU have primary steelmaking capacities. The smallest such sites in the EU have crude steelmaking capacities of just above 1 million tonnes per year, while the largest sites have capacities of around 10 Mt/year. There are 24 such integrated steelmaking sites in the EU.

Steel mills may be forced to take maintenance shutdowns as demand dips sharply following export duty levy,"Steelmakers may be forced to take maintenance shutdowns at their plants this month to combat a demand-supply mismatch in the domestic market after sudden levy of export duty on steel last month hit their overseas business, people in the know said.The export duty, imposed to check rising inflation in the country, has resulted in volatile steel prices in the domestic market. Now, traders and end-users are deferring large orders in expectations of further price correction, the sources said.The buyers are dipping into their holding stock to meet requirements. This has resulted in the piling up of finished inventory with steel mills , they said.Inventory of finished steel is also piling up at mills as export has nosedived since the levy of the new duty, experts said.Prices of the alloy continue to dip in the domestic market in tandem with a decline in input costs and global steel prices. The prices of benchmark hot-rolled coil ( HRC ) steel at traders’ end dipped by 9% since the imposition of the export duty to around Rs 63,100 per tonne as of June 8, according to data from SteelMint, a market intelligence firm.“Price correction is not a worry. What is worrying us is the demand,” a senior executive at a leading steelmaker told ET, requesting not to be named. “When destocking happens, not all steelmakers will be able to afford holding inventory.”Scheduled maintenance shutdowns are a norm at steel mills.Many companies are looking to advance these to this month to balance out the demand-supply mismatch, said an executive at another leading steelmaker.Private steel mills hold about 15-17 days of inventory while the public-sector ones hold around 20-23 days of inventory, according to SteelMint.“We are getting the indication that if inventories go above these levels, then the steel mills will think of having maintenance shutdowns,” a spokesperson for the intelligence firm told ET.The government had imposed a 15% duty on the export of steel, effective May 22. It also levied a duty on the export of iron ore, a key raw material, and removed import duties on coal in a bid to reduce the input costs for steelmakers. The move has resulted in the softening of steel and iron ore prices.To be sure, prices of steel in the domestic market had been correcting since the first week of April after hitting a peak of Rs 78,800 per tonne. Prices also soften during this time of the year due to seasonal slowdown in demand as construction activity slows down during monsoons. The rate of reduction in steel prices has picked up since the export duty levy.The second executive quoted above expects destocking to ease over the next 10-15 days as traders and end-users run low on inventory and steel prices also find some stability.Criticising the new export levy , the first executive quoted above said prices of steel have always moved in tandem with input costs, and referred to prices of iron ore, coking coal and crude oil, which have approximately increased between 90% and 250% in the last two years.Domestic steel has always been cheaper than imported steel in the country, the executives claimed.“Steel prices have not gone up in isolation,” one of them said. “If you want steel prices to come down to Rs 38,000 (a tonne), then input prices need to come down too.”Domestic steel cost around Rs 38,000 a tonne in April 2020.",,[],['Nehal Chaliawala']
"Port-based manufacturing jobs on horizon in Paulsboro, two steel plants under construction","Port-based manufacturing jobs on horizon in Paulsboro, two steel plants under construction

PAULSBORO – Two steel plants to fabricate giant monopiles for a planned offshore wind turbine network are under construction here and expected to be finished with workforces hired before the end of 2022, according to Mayor Gary Stevenson.

On total buildout, the port-based facility promises to employ more than 500 people. The hiring process will add “a little weight” to applications from borough residents, the mayor said in a recent interview.

“And why does that help me?” Stevenson said. “Many reasons. We have our share of low-income people and a high unemployment rate.”

The fabrication facility is in an area of the port terminal and will have four buildings in operation, ultimately. The South Jersey Port Authority recently filed with the N.J. Department of Environmental Protection for three permits needed to start work on the third and fourth buildings.

Stevenson said an employee training program will be announced soon. The program will involve Rowan University and Gloucester County Institute of Technology in Deptford Township, he said.

“You go get trained to be a welder, or a painter, or whatever it may be,” Stevenson said. “And, most likely, you’ll get hired by the port. Those 500 people have to eat. So, it helps my luncheonettes around here, my diners. Helps the hardware stores.”

The building and hiring timetable were part of a discussion this month between the borough and the port authority on how the project is progressing.

The port authority operates the Paulsboro Marine Terminal that opened in March 2017. The monopile fabrication is happening within the terminal.

Stevenson said hiring is expected to place in three stages, with approximately 150 to 175 positions filled in each stage. Each stage will correspond with the facility’s progress, he said.

At full buildout, Stevenson said, the fabrication facility easily should be the largest, single employer of Paulsboro residents. The borough, about 2.6 square miles including waterways, has about 5,900 residents.

“The good-paying jobs aren’t here in town anymore,” Stevenson said. “When I grew up, everyone had a job,” Stevenson said. “Either you were at the refinery, the chemical plant, or E.I. Du Pont in Gibbstown or right down along in Carneys Point for Du Pont. Eighty-five percent of your families worked there or somebody in your family. Du Pont’s gone. Chemical plant’s gone.”

“Monopiles” is the industry term for the 400-foot-tall columns that will be driven into the ocean bed. Electricity-producing wind turbines will be mounted on top, above the reach of waves.

The monopiles are assembled from multiple steel pipe sections shipped in from Europe to Paulsboro. After assembly, the monopiles will be taken by barge and shipped into the Delaware Bay for installation.

A facility in Salem County will do related work on windmill parts, also for shipping on completion to sites in coastal waters.

According to the permit applications recently filed with the DEP, the proposed third and fourth buildings would engage in steel plate welding, roll bending, and circumferential welding.

The proposed work is the second phase in the project that created the existing Paulsboro Marine Terminal.

The new applications call for construction of a 169,215-square foot building and an 89,105-square foot building. The buildings will be on a 23.8-acre parcel at 50 Universal Road, which converges on Mantua Creek.

The first phase of work on the Paulsboro Marine Terminal got started in 2012. The terminal sits on former industrial properties along the river. Construction projects at that time included a wharf, ship berths, and using dredged materials to raise waterfront land and reduce exposure to flooding.

The marine terminal opened for business in March 2017 with an 850-foot-long berth. The “full buildout” goal is for three deep-water berths on the river and a 550-foot-long barge berth on Mantua Creek, in addition to railroad and road connections.

Construction is scheduled to start July 1 on a berth for ""roll on-roll off"" type vessels.

Construction also starts then on mooring “dolphins,” a term referring to a group of pilings driven into the riverbed.

Additionally, the work includes depositing dredged material on the site’s uplands to increase its height.

The project site consists of about 130 acres formerly used by BP Oil Company and about 60 acres operated by Essex Chemical, a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company.

Philadelphia International Airport is directly across the river.

"Ukraine’s Richest Man Plans to Sue Russia for Destruction of Steel Plants, Lost Business","Ukraine’s richest man says he plans to sue Russia over what he said was $17 billon to $20 billion in losses caused by its bombardment of steel plants he owns in the devastated city of Mariupol.

The Azovstal steelworks suffered heavy damage from Russian bombing and shelling after the sprawling plant became the last bastion of defense in the southern port city. The Illich Steel and Iron Works, also owned by Akhmetov, was also badly damaged during Russian shelling of Mariupol.

“We will definitely sue Russia and demand proper compensation for all losses and lost business,” Rinat Akhmetov, who owns the biggest Ukrainian steelmaker Metinvest, told Ukrainian news portal mrpl.city in an interview.

Asked how much money Metinvest had lost because of the damage to Azovstal and Illich, he said: “The replacement cost … due to Russian aggression is from $17 to $20 billion. The final amount will be determined in a lawsuit against Russia.”

Billionaire Akhmetov had already seen his business empire shattered before the war by eight years of fighting in Ukraine’s east after pro-Russian separatists took over swaths of territory there.

Since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24, Metinvest has announced it cannot deliver its supply contracts. While Akhmetov’s financial and industrial SCM Group is servicing its debt obligations, his private power producer DTEK has restructured its debt portfolio, he said.

Akhmetov said he had remained in Ukraine since the war with Russia began, adding: “We believe in our country and believe in our victory.”

JSW Steel is far from regaining its sheen,"Shares of JSW Steel have declined by nearly 11% since the government levied export duty on steel effective 22 May. This along with dull international prices has resulted in the domestic price of this commodity correcting significantly.

According to SteelMint, domestic hot-rolled coil prices plunged by 20% from the highs seen in April to ₹63,100 per tonne as on 8 June.

“Management expects price declines to stabilize unless coking coal costs come down from present levels of around $400 per tonne,"" said analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) in a report on 13 June. The brokerage hosted JSW Steel at Nomura Investment Forum

However, the imposition of export duty means lower realization on shipments. Even so, the company will continue to export 15-20% of its production in FY23 in order to maintain long-term customer relations.

“Relatively lower realization on exports by 15% and with exports accounting for 15% of management’s sales estimates, overall net steel realization can be impacted by 2.0-2.5% for FY23F,"" added the Nomura report.

But there is some respite from the softening of raw material costs such as coking coal and iron ore. However, this impact is expected to reflect in the financials with a lag. Thus, the company expects Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) per tonne to stabilize from Q2FY23.

On the demand front, there could be a slowdown in construction activity due to the upcoming monsoon season which would weigh on steel demand. On the other hand, the demand from automobile sector continues to be firm with increased traction seen for passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles.

In H1FY23, the company anticipates mill-level inventories to rise but the channel inventories to be softer in the near term due to subdued demand. As prices stabilize, it foresees buying to re-emerge from the later part of June.

Meanwhile, it targets to achieve brownfield capacity expansion at $400 per tonne which is considerably below the $1000 per tonne replacement cost of steel plants globally. “We believe management focus on relatively low-cost brownfield expansion, digitalization and other cost measures will structurally boost profitability,"" added the Nomura report.",,[],[]

Accelerating toward net zero: The green business building opportunity,"Getting to net zero will require tremendous, rapid change and large-scale technology deployment across industries. The transition will create massive opportunities to build entirely new businesses.

A recent McKinsey report found that reaching net zero by 2050 could entail a 60 percent increase in capital spending on physical assets, compared with current levels. The required investments amount to $9.2 trillion per year until 2050, of which $6.5 trillion annually would go into low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure. Our analysis also shows that growing demand for net-zero offerings could generate more than $12 trillion of annual sales by 2030 across 11 value pools, including transport ($2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion per year), power ($1.0 trillion to $1.5 trillion), and hydrogen ($650 billion to $850 billion) (Exhibit 1). Such a transformation of the global economy could create significant growth potential for climate technologies and solutions.

Exhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com

Some technologies will be key in propelling the transition to net zero. In Europe, for example, our research suggests that just 15 technologies could drive 70 percent of the emissions abatement required to reach net zero in the region. Technologies that are mature and already available at a commercial scale, including onshore wind and solar photovoltaic, account for about 25 percent of the abatement potential in Europe, while an additional 45 percent could come from technologies that have an opportunity to be commercialized in the near future. This means that, in addition to renewable-energy technologies and electric mobility, technologies for zero-carbon residential heating (such as heat pumps), carbon capture and storage, green-hydrogen-based fuels, and industrial electrification could support decarbonization at scale.

In many markets, start-ups have been the first to scale up climate-tech businesses (renewable energy and electric vehicles, for example), while incumbents have been slower to adapt. But it’s not too late for established companies to break into still-maturing climate-technology domains, where the playing field remains wide open—provided that they move quickly. In addition, there will be room for thousands of surrounding players as these businesses develop and mature.

A recent McKinsey report found that reaching net zero by 2050 could entail a 60 percent increase in capital spending on physical assets, compared with current levels.

Building green businesses is top of mind for many leaders. In Leap by McKinsey’s state of new-business building report, 92 percent of executives say that new businesses built in the next five years will address sustainability to some extent—and 42 percent expect to put sustainability at the center of their new businesses’ value proposition. In our work with organizations that have built green businesses, we have identified ways companies could set themselves up not only for entry into a market but also for significant growth. Green business builders will likely need to plan and scale at the speed of digital companies to accelerate the transition to net zero. They’re ambitious with their growth goals and have cost advantages, often because they move quickly. Here, we share key lessons from successful green business builders.

Moving at the speed of digital

While it took many years and significant governmental support to scale up renewable-electricity generation, broadening support for the net-zero agenda could enable the next wave of green businesses to grow more quickly.

By now, more than 3,000 companies across the world have set or are in the process of committing to an emissions reduction through the Science Based Targets initiative, an institution that has created a framework around reduction commitments for businesses. Additionally, regulation (the EU taxonomy, for instance, which helps to define what economic activities in the region can be considered environmentally sustainable), investor activism, and rising consumer interest, among other factors, are pushing companies to benchmark and improve the sustainability performance of their offerings. For example, suppliers in B2B value chains are facing increasingly stringent emissions-reductions requirements as more of their customers pursue net-zero strategies. All of this is likely to accelerate the adoption of cleaner materials—such as low-emissions steel in the automotive industry, as one example—and solutions (for instance, the electrification of thermal-energy processes in manufacturing). Some sustainable products, such as low-emissions steel and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the plastic most commonly used for beverage bottles, are already seeing a price premium due to a shortage of supply versus demand.

The development of green businesses could be much faster for an additional reason: some climate technologies can only compete on price when they are being manufactured at a large enough scale (more on this idea in a later section). The need to scale up quickly to compete could propel new green businesses to achieve execution speeds that are more familiar to the digital economy. Commercializing many green technologies will likely require significant investments in physical assets, which aren’t required for software development or digital engineering; these investments could reach billions of dollars or euros per plant. Nevertheless, green business builders can learn lessons from digital-business builders, including aggressive growth plans, working with agility, and being a first mover. Historically, scaling sustainable technologies has been done carefully, step-by-step over years, to manage both the technological and commercial risks involved.

A few companies in the alternative-proteins and alternative-dairy categories illustrate how embracing the speed of digital could create a market advantage. For one, some of these players did not allow their lack of manufacturing capacity to get in the way of growth. They were early to get their products distributed through leading fast-food and coffee chains, which helped to elevate brand awareness. Some relied on co-manufacturing, even though this typically hurts margins in the short term. And now, as their revenues have grown, some of these players are building up their own manufacturing capacity to help meet demand, often with larger plants that produce goods at lower unit costs.

In some cases these players could experience scaling pains—when demand outpaces expanded production capacity, for example. However, being early to market and growing quickly has resulted in strong market share, with the distribution and cost advantages that come along with such a position. Gross margins tend to be strong for these players, too, since many consumers have been willing to pay a premium for their products. These companies have typically reinvested profits back into the business.

The alternative-proteins and alternative-dairy examples are, of course, B2C cases. However, scaling early and quickly is an approach that, based on our experience, may help to separate strong green businesses, whether B2B or B2C, from competitors or followers in the same space.

Seven keys to scaling green businesses

For green business building, incumbents may have advantages, including access to capital and deep institutional knowledge. Some corporate leaders have identified success factors for building a new business in general, such as providing ring-fenced investment in the new business and setting realistic expectations with both internal and external stakeholders on investment needs. However, building a green business can also come with new challenges for incumbents. For example, when scaling a new climate technology, it may be difficult to balance the time it takes to validate the technology on a demonstration scale while also planning industrial-scale installations across different conditions and geographies. Start-ups typically have been the first movers on some green ventures, as they are often equipped with a higher tolerance for risk-taking and the ability to operate at faster speeds.

Through our work with organizations that have built and scaled green businesses successfully, we have identified seven key principles.

Lead with game-changing ambition. Effective green business builders tend to set their sights on creating something significant from the start. Game-changing ambition may mean aspiring to produce a zero-carbon product at a competitive cost (which enables a competitive price), compared with a less sustainable alternative, and scaling new capacity fast. Leaders tend to think about what it will take for the product to achieve significant market share within the next, say, five years—instead of 15—and engineer backward from there, much like in the world of digital business building. Our experience shows that operating with such ambition could result in companies reaching their targeted costs faster. By setting firm production-capacity goals, a new business might better position itself to reach lower unit costs faster and potentially be competitive on price from the start (more on cost advantages shortly). Leading with game-changing ambition could also encourage certain markets to make the shift to net zero faster. For example, H2 Green Steel, a Swedish company founded in 2020, is building a fossil-fuel-free steel mill that relies on a hydrogen-based production process. Last year, H2 Green Steel announced that total financing for the first phase of the project is approximately €2.5 billion ($2.7 billion), and the company plans to begin production in 2024. Industry incumbents in Europe may have already been planning green-steel investments, but H2 Green Steel’s launch has coincided with incumbents now pursuing at least 20 other green-steel projects in the region.

Industry incumbents in Europe may have already been planning green-steel investments, but H2 Green Steel’s launch has coincided with incumbents now pursuing at least 20 other green-steel projects in the region. Secure a cost advantage by identifying a scaling break point for any new technology. Building a business around a clean technology may require analyzing different technological pathways, including some technology options that are not yet commercialized. When analyzing a new technology, leaders must understand the scale break point for cost competitiveness, so business viability can be reached as quickly as possible. Take recycled textiles, for example. Based on our experience, many fashion and apparel players are looking to introduce materials that require the scaling of textile-recycling technologies. Our analysis of one of the technologies identified the scale break point at which producing recycled man-made cellulosic fibers, an alternative to virgin viscose, would likely be cost competitive. In this case, only when average plant size and the number of plants reaches a critical scale could costs be expected to become competitive (Exhibit 2). Before committing to investments at scale, leaders may benefit from knowing the relative maturity of the technologies, assessing their performance under different scaling speeds, and understanding the environmental footprint.

Sign up captive demand before scaling. Green business builders often tackle the commercial side of investment risk by signing up captive demand for their output before they start to physically scale—as Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt AB did with Volkswagen and BMW. Many green business builders—including Northvolt—also invite their customers to invest in the business up front, as a way to align interests even further. Alternatively, when larger corporations start a green business, they might themselves be the ideal first captive customer. For example, shipping company Maersk and ferry operator DFDS are major investors in a new e-ammonia project (e-ammonia is a green shipping fuel).

Many green business builders—including Northvolt—also invite their customers to invest in the business up front, as a way to align interests even further. Alternatively, when larger corporations start a green business, they might themselves be the ideal first captive customer. For example, shipping company Maersk and ferry operator DFDS are major investors in a new e-ammonia project (e-ammonia is a green shipping fuel). Build capacity with parallel scaling. To reach scale-up goals, the ability to drive several investments or market introductions in a limited time frame is key. Often we’ve seen leaders “parallelize the scaling” from the start—that is, initiate additional growth waves before they have completed the first one. They create a modular, replicable standard for production based on the first business deployment rather than a tailor-made, one-off pilot. They also incorporate key lessons from each growth wave into the next, as a way to help manage costs and keep ambitious deployment timelines on schedule. One example of the parallel-scaling approach is a zero-carbon metals player that is planning to start building a second plant halfway into the construction of the first—and aims to complete it in approximately half the time as the first. The parallelization of scaling is also something to consider when growing adjacent businesses.

Proactively create business ecosystems. Many green business building efforts are also value-chain-building efforts. Consider circular materials, like the recycled textiles example mentioned earlier. There is a need to secure effective collection, appropriate sorting and processing, and market-based demand for the recycled textile fibers. No one player is the natural investor in all steps of the value chain. But investments in a single step may be less feasible without all the other steps already in place. Similarly, many new green businesses require new infrastructure around them. In the case of the e-ammonia project, substantial investments in upstream hydrogen and renewable electricity capacity are needed, as well as new transportation and fueling infrastructure downstream. Green business builders look to collaborate with players in their value chains and make sure that the infrastructure and investments come together in a coordinated manner. This could be done through joint feasibility studies or demonstration pilots where relevant players team up. When done successfully, these collaborations could also lead to the captive-demand arrangements described earlier. Once the framework of a new value chain starts to operate and has a financial underpinning, more ecosystem players may start gravitating toward it. One example of new ecosystem players getting together is the Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) Council. The CEO-led group has brought together key actors—from technology providers to end customers—with the aim of understanding the technology landscape and pathways to economic breakthrough and scaling. Council participants are in a position to help shape their industries and drive collaborations.

Lead on sustainable operations, through ambitious targets, innovation, and partnerships. Successful green business builders are leaders in how their operations minimize carbon emissions and other environmental impacts. For example, Northvolt, the Swedish battery manufacturer, has set a target to produce batteries that have a lower carbon footprint than most current EV batteries—by 80 to 90 percent—by leveraging green electricity and recycled input materials. Sustainable-textile company Spinnova has designed a manufacturing process with a water and chemicals footprint that is lower than that of similar products. Many green business builders also partner with organizations that share the same mentality. This 360-degree dedication to sustainability could help to drive credibility and encourage partnerships and innovation that may keep these companies ahead of their peers.

Dedicate recruiting resources early in the process. Many green business builders, whether they’re start-ups or corporates, are seeking the talent they need to scale quickly—and the range of skills required to pull off successful green businesses can be wide. Green business builders identify individuals who could help shape and (as needed) pivot strong business models and explore potential partnerships and financing structures. Many new green businesses benefit from those who understand customers’ technical, investment, and decision-making processes. Consider the specific skill sets the organization may need to meet business goals. For B2B technologies, for example, there could be a need to build awareness and acceptance. In B2C, strong brand-building skills could be beneficial to create messaging that speaks to green credibility and tangible, real-world impact. Finally, physical technology ramp-up, factory construction, and supply chain scaling at an ambitious speed typically require bringing along the best of the best in operations skills. Dedicating resources for recruiting early in the endeavor could be a critical enabler of scaling quickly, especially in areas where there may be a scarcity of talent.

Green business builders often tackle the commercial side of investment risk by signing up captive demand for their output before they start to physically scale.

Building a green business is no small feat. It often requires moving at unprecedented speed, setting ambitious growth targets, and planning multiple steps ahead. The mindset green business builders have demonstrated is very close to that of the digital leaders of our time: they have been adept at creating and shaping markets rather than spectating and waiting for the markets to appear, and they have embraced the notion of accelerated scaling. This mindset combined with a few key principles could help propel green business building on the global journey to net zero.",,[],"['Rob Bland Anna Granskog Tomas Nauclér', 'Rob Bland', 'Anna Granskog', 'Tomas Nauclér']"
TATA Group: Tata Steel shares price to turn ex-dividend today,"(With inputs from agencies)

How Charm Industrial hopes to use crops to cut steel emissions,"The iron and steel industry produces about 4 billion tons of carbon emissions each year, accounting for around 10% of all energy-related climate pollution, according to a 2020 report by the International Energy Agency. Those figures have risen sharply this century, driven by rapid economic growth in China and elsewhere.

The hefty emissions and increasingly strict climate policies in some areas, including Canada and the European Union, have started to compel some companies to explore cleaner ways of producing these essential building blocks of the modern world.

The Swedish joint venture Hybrit delivered the first commercial batch of green steel to Volvo last year. This partnership between the steel giant SSAB, the state-owned power company Vattenfall, and the mining company LKAB, used a manufacturing method that relied on carbon-free hydrogen in lieu of coal and coke. Other companies are exploring the use of facilities with equipment that captures carbon dioxide or, like Boston Metal, implementing entirely different electrochemical methods.

Charm is evaluating still another approach. In the back corner of the company’s warehouse, employees have been using a narrow metal contraption, known as a reformer, to react the company’s bio-oil with hot steam and oxygen. That produces what’s known as syngas, which is mostly a mix of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.

Bio-oil produced from crop remains. CHARM INDUSTRIAL

That could potentially be swapped into one method of producing iron and steel.

The most common form of steel production starts with a blast furnace, which heats iron ore, limestone, and coke, a form of coal, to temperatures above 1,500 ˚C. The resulting carbon-laden metal, known as “pig iron,” then moves into a second furnace, where oxygen is blown into it, impurities are removed, and other materials are added to produce various grades of steel.

Emissions occur at every stage of this process, including the extraction and production of iron, coal, and coke; the combustion of fuels to run the furnaces; and the chemical reactions that occur within them.",,[],['James Temple']

Nationwide coal scarcity hurts Rourkela Steel Plant in Odisha,"By Express News Service

ROURKELA: The ongoing coal crunch in India has hit production in SAIL's Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) here. The most lucrative plant of SAIL has been forced to cut down the daily hot metal production for want of imported coal.

The NTPC-SAIL Power Company Ltd (NSPCL) at RSP has also recently suspended its new 250 MW unit due to inadequate availability of boiler coal. The power unit was commissioned on March 29.

Sources said on an average, three blast furnaces (BFs) produce around 14,000 tonne of hot metal daily. But for the last 10 days, daily hot metal production has been cut down significantly. On Monday, the hot metal output was 12,500 tonne while it was 11,500 tonne on Sunday. The situation would deteriorate further with depletion of the existing imported coal inventory and delay in arrival of fresh stock.

Former general secretary of Steel Executives' Federation of India (SEFI) Bimal Bisi said the situation will have serious implications on the profitability of RSP. Besides, lower output with fixed expenditure will lead to rise in production cost.

Seeking intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Bisi claimed that imported coal consignments are waiting at Paradip, Dhamra, Haldia and Visakhapatnam ports without reaching RSP as the government has prioritised supply only to power plants.

""The RSP needs around 2.5 railway rakes of imported coal (one rake carries 3,600-3,700 tonne) daily, but is hardly receiving one rake for steel production,"" he said.

Sources said 80 per cent of imported coal arrives from Australia and the rest 20 per cent from USA and Mozambique. The imported coal is converted into coke in the ovens before being blended to feed in the BFs.

Bisi said in 2021-22, the RSP had registered an all-time high profit. In June, the plant is likely to suffer loss due to continuing production loss and unfavourable market condition. The RSP provides boiler coal to the NSPCL plant and the new unit of 250 MW had to be closed for shortly supply. In May, the RSP received around 80,000 tonne against the requirement of 1.65 lakh tonne.",,[],[]
Tata Steel unveils green investment plan for UK steel tube mill,"has unveiled a 7-million pound investment plan for its Hartlepool Tube Mill in north-east England that the Indian steel major says will cut carbon emissions, improve capacity and reduce costs to strengthen its UK business.The investment will go into a new slitter which will allow the Hartlepool site to process coils of steel delivered from Tata's Port Talbot steelmaking site in South Wales. All of the steel products made at the site, where almost 300 people work producing up to 200,000 tonnes ofa year, are 100 per cent recyclable and the investment is forecast to pay for itself in less than three years.""This project will allow us to bring a vital process on site, which in turn will free up thousands of tonnes of capacity at the Port Talbot site,"" Andrew Ward, Works Manager of Tata Steel in Hartlepool, said last week.""This will improve our efficiency and reduce overall CO2 emissions from our steel processing as well as reducing the total costs across the business,"" he said.Currently, wide steel slabs are slit in Port Talbot before being rolled and sent to Hartlepool to be turned into steel tubes, which are then used in a wide range of products such as agricultural machinery, sports stadiums, steel-framed buildings and the energy sector.The new project is expected to take more than a year to complete and is the second major investment announced by the Indian company in the UK this year after an investment plan for its site at Corby in the north-eastern England region. Both projects will further strengthen the UK business, improving services to customers and using the latest available technology to reduce environmental emissions, Tata Steel UK said.Andrew Ward added: ""Above all, safety will be a key factor in this investment both during the construction phase and when the new slitter is up and running. It will feature the latest computer-controlled technology, which reduces the need for our employees to be close to any hazardous operations and it will be as energy-efficient as possible.""The new slitter line will optimise the UK value chain for our smaller tube product range, allowing steel coil to flow through the chain and provide flexibility with on-site slitting . This investment will support the ongoing drive to improve customer delivery performance and responsiveness which the Hartlepool 20"" Mill team pride themselves upon.""Tata Steel in the UK says it has the ambition to produce net-zero steel by 2050 at the latest and to have reduced 30 per cent of CO2 emissions by 2030.

"Steel tube manufacturer Vallourec closes plants in Germany, France and the UK","Last Wednesday, the Vallourec steel pipe manufacturer announced what thousands of its workers had long feared. The multinational, which produces seamless tubes mainly for the gas and oil industry, is closing its plants in Düsseldorf-Rath and Mülheim/Ruhr, destroying about 2,400 jobs at these two sites alone.

Production of seamless pipes in Western Europe is to be halted completely. About 1,650 workers are affected in Düsseldorf and 750 in Mülheim. In addition, the closings will hit the many employees in subcontracting firms.

The two plants being closed in Germany used to belong to the Mannesmannröhren-Werke, which has a long history. The Düsseldorf plant in the Rath district has existed since 1899, while the Mülheim plant has existed since 1966 and is the second largest industrial employer in the city after the Siemens Energy plant.

The Mannesmann Group was taken over and broken up by Vodafone in 2000. A cooperation between the tube works and Vallourec has existed since 1997, when the joint venture Vallourec & Mannesmann Tubes (V&M Tubes) was formed. In 2005, Vallourec acquired the Mannesmann shares. In 2013, the German corporate unit became Vallourec Deutschland GmbH.

Vallourec is a classic multinational. The corporation owns 50 production facilities in over 20 countries with 20,000 employees; its headquarters are in France.

The closure of the factories and the destruction of many thousands more jobs in subcontracting firms are part of a worldwide rationalisation programme, as is currently being prepared and implemented in many corporations. Global corporations are reacting to the international economic crisis and the growing competition on the world market by lowering labour costs or relocating production to low-wage countries with the lowest social standards.

In the process, the international banks and big investors set the tone. Production is trimmed for profit and increasing shareholder value. The pandemic and NATO’s proxy war against Russia serve as a pretext for a frontal attack on the rights and living conditions of workers, who are paying with job losses and inflation for massive rearmament spending, war and the enormous enrichment of the corporations and the super-rich.

The trade unions have nothing to counter this attack except feigned indignation and toothless protests. They act as accomplices of corporate management and offer them “alternative rationalisation programmes.” They want to prove that, with their help, exploitation can also be drastically intensified on the home soil.

This can be seen all too clearly in the case of Vallourec. The closure of factories in Germany also means the closure of the plant in Saint-Saulve in northern France, with 100 jobs, where the tubes produced in Düsseldorf and Mülheim are reworked. Ten years ago, there were 1,000 jobs there, which were gradually cut with the help of the trade unions, employing the usual salami tactics.

One of the group’s sites, in Bellshill, Scotland, with 70 jobs, will also be closed. Production there is to be moved to Aulnoye in France, on condition that the company is then profitable and that appropriate sales markets are developed. Secondly, the company wants to introduce “additive manufacturing” and install robots to produce steel parts in small batches or, as with 3D printers, on a custom basis.

According to the French press, Vallourec also wants to rationalise its research and development department by merging it into one site in Aulnoye, cutting 100 jobs. About 60 other jobs are to be cut at the group’s headquarters near Paris. In total, 300 jobs will go in France as part of a plan to “safeguard employment.”

Worldwide, 2,950 jobs will be lost because of the measures now decided by the Vallourec board, mainly in Europe. The number of employees will drop from 17,000 to 14,000. In France, about 1,300 jobs will remain at Vallourec.

At the same time, the company is building a new production facility in Brazil to supply markets in the Middle East and a plant in Ohio in the US to supply drilling sites for the extraction of shale oil and gas (fracking) in the North American market.

Workers at the Vallourec plants have been concerned about their jobs and livelihoods for months. In November last year, management had announced the sale of the tube plants in Mülheim and Düsseldorf, which had accumulated losses of €700 million since 2015. Some financial investors had showed interest in the plants but did not want to pay anything for them. Instead, they demanded sums running into hundreds of millions of euros for the takeover, for example, for company pensions and other company commitments.

Vallourec CEO Philippe Guillemot justified the closures by saying they had not found a buyer for the plants with a sustainable plan; to avoid further losses, they therefore had to be closed. He claimed that sites in Western Europe were no longer profitable in the face of competition from Eastern European countries with much lower wage and production costs in the manufacture of pipes for the Middle East or other regions.

The role of the IG Metall union

Just two days before the closure was announced, IG Metall organised a convoy of about a thousand workers from Germany to Paris to protest in front of Vallourec headquarters.

Instead of organising joint action with French workers who are also losing their jobs, IG Metall officials delivered pathetic funeral speeches and bemoaned the owners’ profit lust and the king-of-the-castle stance of the decision-makers, with whom they closely collaborate. The union bureaucrats’ cowardly prattle is designed to spread hopelessness and demoralisation.

The globalisation of production and the systematic division and blackmail of the workers means the trade union policy of “social partnership” (i.e., collaborating with the employers) is proving completely bankrupt. To prevent the relocation of production, the works councils and trade union officials try to undercut the extreme exploitation in the low-wage countries by proposing their own rationalisation measures and social cuts. In this way, they set in motion a downward spiral in which the corporations and their shareholders earn handsomely.

At Vallourec, too, IG Metall and the works council had actively supported the downsizing plans from the start. They even commissioned a consultancy firm to draw up their own continuation concept for the plants, which they presented as an alternative to the sale planned by management. According to this concept, production at the German plants was to be oriented towards future markets around hydrogen, geothermal energy, offshore wind plants and solar technology.

This concept, which was also supported by the German management, as Labour Director Herbert Schaaff told the WAZ, still envisaged the elimination of 700 to 800 jobs, while at the same time increasing turnover by 10 percent within the next five years!

The whining of the works councils, that “even this plan is now wastepaper,” is pure hogwash. It merely served as a stalling tactic to prevent a fight for the unconditional preservation of jobs. This is known from numerous similar cases in the past. The Opel plants in Bochum, which at their peak employed 20,000 workers, were shut down in a similar step-by-step method with the collaboration of IG Metall.

Anger boiled over at a works meeting of both plants held on Friday in the ISS Dome in Düsseldorf. The Vallourec management, which had travelled from Paris to justify the closure decision, was greeted with a sustained shrill chorus of whistles; the CEO’s speech was constantly interrupted by boos and heckling. Finally, the event was abandoned, and the management left the hall through the back exit under police protection.

“At the moment, it is completely unclear how production will continue at the two sites until the end of next year in this emotionally charged situation,” commented broadcaster WDR. “It seems possible that there will be a strike.”

Industrial action—a strike or occupation of the plants—is indeed the only way to defend jobs. But that requires a complete break with IG Metall and its works council representatives. Even if they feel forced to organise a few more symbolic protests, they will do everything to stifle any serious fight.

The Ruhr area—from Dortmund (Hoesch) to Bochum (Opel) to Duisburg-Rheinhausen (Krupp)—is full of industrial ruins where tens of thousands once worked. Many had fought bitterly to defend their jobs, but the IG Metall and its works council representatives sabotaged workers’ resistance each time.

For this they were handsomely rewarded. The most famous case is that of Oliver Burkhard, who headed the IG Metall district of North Rhine-Westphalia from 2007 to 2013 before moving to the board of steelmakers thyssenkrupp as personnel director on a salary of millions. Since May 1 this year, Burkhard has had another job: he remains a board member of thyssenkrupp and additionally now heads the defence company thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, Europe’s leading systems supplier for submarines and naval vessels, as CEO.

While workers were raging with anger, all that could be heard from union officials and politicians was the usual demoralised whining. The director of IG Metall Düsseldorf-Neuss, Karsten Kaus, told dpa that they had tried everything to follow the sales process. A continuation concept had also been developed with the works council and a consulting firm. “In the end, none of this came to fruition.”

The IG Metall secretary in Mülheim, Dirk Horstkamp, told WAZ: “There is a lot of consternation here. It’s really hard how Vallourec treats the people here,” he said, and the workforce had put everything on the line.

Workers must reject this cowardly talk with contempt. It is necessary to break out of the straitjacket of the trade unions and organise independently of IG Metall and the works councils in rank-and-file action committees. The first task of these action committees is to make contact with colleagues in France, Scotland and other countries to organise joint industrial action to defend all jobs unconditionally.

The closure and retrenchment plans of Vallourec and the unions must not be accepted. The interests and needs of the workers must come before the company’s drive for profits.

To wage this struggle, it is necessary to build the Sozialistische Gleichheitspartei (SGP, Socialist Equality Party) and organise this struggle based on an international socialist programme. Get in touch with the SGP! It supports the building of independent action committees and helps to make international contact with workers in other countries and other factories also affected by closure.

Nickel drama highlights Tsingshan’s role in energy transition,"Tsingshan has no doubt been scarred by its experience on the LME, but the exchange’s decision to halt trading has helped to minimise its losses. With revenues of 352 billion yuan (US$53 billion) last year, the company is big enough to recover from the debacle.

It’s likely that Xiang will move into the battery market with the same determination he’s used to become the world’s largest and lowest-cost producer of stainless steel.

The mushrooming of Tsingshan’s nickel empire

Tsingshan has its origins in the explosion of private enterprise in the city of Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, in the 1980s, following reforms brought in by Deng Xiaoping to loosen the state’s grip on the economy, epitomised by the “Wenzhou model”.

As Wenzhou’s private economy began to boom, Xiang and his relative Zhang Jimin decided to leave the security of the state sector and founded a company to make car doors and windows in 1988. They eventually set up a stainless-steel company in 1992, which was one of China’s first private steel producers.

In the mid-2000s, Tsingshan helped develop a breakthrough process to make stainless steel by producing molten nickel pig iron and hot charging this directly into a stainless-steel plant. The method significantly lowered costs but increased energy consumption.

Yet by the time of the global financial crisis of 2008, Tsingshan, and the rest of China’s steel industry, were facing a nickel shortage. “Sixty to seventy per cent of our stainless steel is nickel, but who produced this nickel?… China had none of its own production,” Xiang recalled. So, in 2009, Xiang decided to go to the world’s biggest producer, Indonesia, and invest in nickel mining. “The decision was forced upon them,” due to the shortage of nickel, a person who knew Xiang well told me. It would later pay off handsomely.

In October 2013, Tsingshan signed an agreement with a local partner to establish the Morowali Industrial Park on the island of Sulawesi to produce nickel pig iron and stainless steel. Though the area was remote and without power, it represented a key plank in Indonesia’s strategy to derive more value from its natural resources. The key to unlocking that promise was Tsingshan.

Tsingshan started turning the Morowali Park into a giant stainless steel and nickel factory, complete with a four-star hotel, runway, port and 2 gigawatt coal-fired power plant. The park employed some 38,000 workers and the project received hundreds of millions of dollars in loans from Beijing’s key strategic lenders, China Development Bank, the China Export-Import Bank, and the British bank HSBC.

Today, Tsingshan is the biggest nickel producer in the world, accounting for around 20 per cent of the global market. The Morowali park mainly produces nickel pig iron for stainless steel. But since last year, Tsingshan has also started to produce a source of nickel for batteries. It achieves this by making nickel matte, an intermediate form of nickel that contains around 75 per cent to 80 per cent of the metal. It also works via two other joint ventures – with Chinese cobalt producer Huayou Cobalt and battery recycling firm GEM – to produce Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP) for batteries.

At the same time, downstream in China, Tsingshan has ventured into the manufacturing of batteries, which will be built using the company’s nickel. Tsingshan has a well-capitalised battery subsidiary, Ruipu Energy, and an energy storage developer, Foxess. This year it invested $375 million to build a lithium plant in Argentina with France’s Eramet, and also agreed on a deal with China’s SAIC Motor to invest 5.5 billion yuan (US$824 million) to build a battery gigafactory in southern Guangxi province.

How will the mountains remain lush?

With investments by Tsingshan and other Chinese companies, such as Huayou Cobalt, Indonesia is likely to be the dominant supplier of nickel for EV batteries by 2025.

But there is an environmental cost to producing nickel matte in Indonesia. It requires large furnaces that rely largely on captive coal-fired power in the country, and can emit almost six times as much carbon dioxide per tonne as producing nickel in Canada, according to the International Energy Agency.

In addition, nickel mining often requires stripping large areas of upland forest to access the lateritic nickel ore near the surface, which can lead to run-off that impacts communities. In addition, many nickel mines also produce hexavalent chromium, which can damage human health. This is the chemical Erin Brockovich campaigned about in the US in 1993, leading to the Oscar-winning Hollywood film after her name.",,[],"['China Dialogue', 'June']"
Opinion: China’s crucial role in decarbonising the global steel sector,"What happens in China’s steel plants matters for the global climate. After power generation, the steel sector is the second largest contributor to China’s emissions, accounting for roughly 17% annually. China produces more than half of all global steel, and over 60% of carbon emissions from steel.

Recent Chinese policy has set out a series of quantitative targets for steel’s decarbonisation, supported by several emissions-saving measures. But these will not be enough to put the sector on a pathway consistent with limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5C.

The scale of the challenge facing Chinese and global steelmakers is considerable. A recent report by climate change think tank E3G and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has unpacked the global and regional implications of a 1.5C-compatible transformation pathway for steel decarbonisation, showing that Chinese steel emissions need to be cut in half by 2030 to keep this goal alive. However, Chinese authorities have recently pushed back the sector’s emissions target, now aiming to peak emissions from steel production “by 2030”, rather than 2025, as its industry association had originally indicated in March 2021.

A faster transition is vital, and efforts from the Chinese steel sector to explore demand-side approaches, accelerate the shift to cleaner technologies and engage in international initiatives will need to be intensified. This would also offer China the opportunity to remain competitive in future green steel markets, engage in global efforts to shape standards for industrial decarbonisation, and become a leader in greening the global steel sector.

Current policy goes in the right direction, but too slowly

For a 1.5C-consistent pathway, China’s steel sector needs to peak emissions as soon as possible, cutting emissions by about half by 2030, and by 99% in 2050, according to our report’s findings.

The latest guidance for the sector to peak emissions before 2030 therefore falls far short. In contrast, key steel-producing companies Baowu Steel, HBIS and Baotou Steel, which together account for 17% of China’s total production, have put forward more ambitious targets. They aim to peak emissions well before 2025, to significantly reduce emissions by 2030, and become net-zero by 2050. The China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) also backed a leaked draft earlier last year that proposed a peaking target by 2025 and emissions reductions of 30% by 2030.

These signals from the industry show that a faster transition is possible. The government should make full use of all policy tools available to promote a sectoral pathway with more ambitious targets, including demand-side levers such as steel recycling and improvements in the efficiency of raw material usage. It should also pursue measures to ramp up the replacement of existing steel capacity with “net zero ready” technologies for production.

Capturing the full potential of demand-side levers

Demand-side levers could play a major role in China’s steel transition. Our report finds that the adoption of a suite of material-efficiency measures, alongside a scaling up of steel recycling, has the potential to halve emissions from the steel sector in 2050, compared to 2020 levels.

Instead of producing primary steel, steel scrap can be recycled to produce new steel in electric arc furnaces (EAF), which do not require any coking coal or iron ore as inputs. Our modelling found that scrap-based steel production in EAFs results in around 85% less emissions than traditional primary production in blast furnaces. By increasing scrap-based EAF production to 56%, China could reduce steel emissions by 39% on 2020 levels come 2050.

Recommended

Meanwhile, material efficiency improvements could reduce global steel emissions by 21% in 2050. These include measures such as lifetime extension, optimised design and post-use recycling of steel-intensive products and buildings. In China, we find that material efficiency improvements alone can bring production levels down, requiring 19% less steel to be produced in 2050.

Capturing the full potential of demand-side levers will require concerted policy efforts to curb primary steel production, to incentivise recycling, improve collection and sorting of steel scrap, and to extend the lifetime of steel-intensive assets. The recent government “guiding opinion” for the sector showed progress in promoting increases in recycling, setting a target for steel scrap use to increase to 300 million tonnes, up from 260 million tonnes in 2020.

Building out infrastructure with low-emission technologies

To move the steel asset base towards cleaner production, new and low-carbon technologies will be needed. Ninety-two percent of steel in China is currently produced via blast and basic oxygen furnaces (BF-BOF) – coal-based units in which metallurgical coal acts as both a source of heat and of carbon in the ironmaking process. As a result, the steel sector is responsible for more than 30% of total coal use in China and has been the main source of growth in demand for coal.

Under a 1.5C scenario, only 10% of China’s steel can be produced using BF-BOF units by 2050, and these furnaces would also need to be equipped with carbon capture and storage technologies. By 2050, most blast furnace production should be replaced by scrap-based electric arc furnaces in combination with green hydrogen-based production of direct reduced iron (DRI).

Scrap-based EAFs increase secondary production and recycling, lowering emissions from primary steel production and increasing the flexibility to meet fluctuating demand. In hydrogen-based DRI production, conventional fossil fuels are replaced by hydrogen derived from renewable energy sources, producing close to no emissions. A number of hydrogen DRI pilots have been announced over the last year in China, and companies project that hydrogen-based net-zero steel could be commercially available as early as 2025. To achieve the necessary level of emissions reductions, it is crucial that both the electricity and hydrogen used come from renewable sources, to facilitate a phase-out of unabated coal in the steel sector before 2050.

China’s target to increase the share of EAF steel output to more than 15% by 2025, as set out in the recent guiding opinion document, is broadly in line with a 1.5C scenario, but there are currently no targets for the sector’s long-term trajectory. While hydrogen-based DRI production is still in its infancy in most of the world, the first industrial-scale hydrogen-based DRI plant, built by Chinese steel producer HBIS, is expected to start operating in the city of Zhangjiakou this year.

The recent guidance also aims to expand the long-standing steel capacity swap policy to encourage the elimination of plants with low efficiency and high energy consumption. As part of the swap policy, for every new furnace approved by local governments, an equivalent or additional amount of old and inefficient blast furnaces need to be phased out.

To achieve the long-term targets above, China will have to significantly accelerate its capacity shift towards scrap-based EAF and hydrogen DRI, which will require increased policy support and incentives. In particular, the government needs to issue clear policy guidance on a decarbonisation pathway that increases recycling and material efficiency in steel production, and accelerates the upgrading of China’s current production fleet to low-emission technologies.

International engagement as the needed impetus

The varying pace of industrial decarbonisation across different countries is likely to drive the development of trade measures to tackle “carbon leakage”. China will soon have to contend with the impacts of carbon levies such as the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). Chinese officials consider CBAM to be a protectionist measure and have repeatedly spoken out against it. But these measures can also offer China incentives to accelerate its domestic transition. For example, steel producers in China using lower carbon technologies such as hydrogen-based DRI could potentially profit from the CBAM.

What is carbon leakage? If carbon taxes lead buyers to purchase products from another country with lower emissions restrictions, carbon emissions are merely shifted beyond the buyer’s borders. This is known as carbon leakage.

There are also emerging discussions on an international climate “club”, spearheaded by Germany. The German proposal aims to establish an “open and cooperative international climate club”, aiming to coordinate policy measures across countries to protect against carbon leakage and facilitate cooperation around industrial decarbonisation. It would be in China’s interest to engage in these discussions and be a shaper instead of a taker of these new rules of the global trading system.

Elsewhere, the UK and India are leading the Industrial Deep Decarbonisation Initiative (IDDI) within the Clean Energy Ministerial, of which China is a member, to coordinate countries to use government procurement to create market demand for low-carbon materials. Engaging in international initiatives such as the IDDI will enable China to play a role in setting global clean economy standards and secure access to future green markets.

To minimise trade tensions and ensure that Chinese steel remains competitive in the global marketplace, China would be well advised to accelerate its efforts to decarbonise the steel sector and play an active role in international initiatives on decarbonising the industry.",,[],[]
Boss of devastated Azovstal plant: ‘Steel is as key to Ukraine’s victory as soldiers’,"The Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol has become one of the symbols of the brutality of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Soldiers held out for weeks in the warren of tunnels, warehouses and cooling blast furnaces as they and hundreds of civilians sheltering with them were encircled and eventually forced to surrender.

The site produced 40% of Ukraine’s entire steel output and was the key asset of the country’s biggest pre-war employer, Metinvest. Now its owner has an important role to play in the parallel battle to sustain the economy via its other plants outside occupied territory, according to its chief executive, Yuriy Ryzhenkov.

“The war effort is not only what you supply to the army, but also how [the] economy functions,” the Metinvest boss says, speaking via video link from a company office in Lviv in the west of Ukraine. “So the better the economy functions, the better the country can fight a war. In our view, in my personal view, the people who are now at our steel mills are just as important to the victory of Ukraine as the soldiers on the frontline.”

Ryzhenkov was in the capital, Kyiv, when he first heard Russian weaponry signalling the start of the invasion, and was stunned that Vladimir Putin’s regime would launch open warfare. The company has since adjusted to operating in a warzone, but at least 153 Metinvest employees have died in the fighting.

Beyond keeping money flowing through the economy, the metals and mining group is playing a direct role in the war effort, delivering steel for 1,500 bulletproof vests a week to Ukraine’s armed forces, and importing military equipment such as drones, night-vision headsets and helmets.

It is a remarkable shift for a company whose main shareholder – Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov – was as recently as November cited by the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as a target to be recruited to back a possible coup attempt. Zelenskiy said Akhmetov was not involved in the plot, and the oligarch said claims of moves to draw him in were “an absolute lie”.

Akhmetov, who has links to the UK including past property investments in London, has remained hugely powerful under successive Ukraine administrations, both pro- and anti-Moscow, and has swung behind the current government, saying his allegiance is only to Ukraine and that Russian soldiers should be punished, adding that he would dedicate his wealth to rebuilding the country.

Ryzhenkov says he is in regular contact with Akhmetov as well as the Kyiv government, but insists the company is not involved with the “political issues” of its owner. “We’re working as a single team towards Ukrainian victory.”

Before the war, Azovstal employed 11,000 people, producing 4m tonnes of steel a year. That has all stopped. Given the scale of the human lives lost, it can be jarring to talk about quotidian business matters. Ryzhenkov raises an eyebrow when asked what Metinvest’s output will be this year, but responds that it will be down at least 60% compared with 2021.

Yet there has been “help from the market” in the form of strong steel prices, which have lessened the blow to the company’s finances, which were in any case in relatively good shape before the February invasion began, with cash balances high. Ryzhenkov says the company’s focus around Mariupol has now turned to providing temporary food and shelter for more than half of the workforce who have already left the city. Metinvest is running a “humanitarian hub” in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, offering medics and psychological help for adults and children.

Yet he estimates that 50,000 of its employees are still working in the country. Two more blast furnaces in Zaporizhzhia and the city of Kamianske to the north are working at about 50% and 60% capacity respectively, with most products going to European markets or ports. Iron ore mining facilities in Ukraine are operating at around 35% to 40% capacity, and a coking coalmine is at about 75%.

Running a humanitarian operation alongside one of the country’s largest businesses during wartime is not something most chief executives face, but Metinvest has had some preparation. It was forced to move its headquarters from Donetsk after Kremlin-backed separatists first invaded Ukraine’s east in 2014 and turn more towards European markets and non-Russian suppliers for fuel where possible. Then, in the pandemic, it implemented remote working for all eligible staff.

The issue is getting the goods to customers. There has been “quite a significant slowdown in the flow of goods”, Ryzhenkov says. Ukraine and EU governments could step in to provide subsidies for transport, he suggests. The situation for food exports is of particular urgency, not just for Ukrainians, but for poorer consumers of imported wheat around the world.

“It is a big concern,” he says. “Logistics is the key bottleneck right now for many Ukrainian businesses. The government is trying to restart the economy, but without resolving these logistical difficulties, it’s going to be very difficult. We are concerned about the speed at which these bottlenecks are being ‘debottlenecked’.” Reopening Black Sea ports at Mariupol and Odesa is “the key for economy restart”, he adds.

Efforts to increase exports via rail are complicated by the different railway gauges used in Ukraine and Poland, so Metinvest has set up reloading centres in Poland and Slovakia to move products more quickly on to Europe-compatible trains. There is a limit to what can be taken by road, and Ukraine is struggling with severe lack of fuel. Ryzhenkov says government efforts to cap prices have worsened the shortage instead.

From the images of Azovstal’s destruction that filtered out – some of them truly extraordinary – it seems like there cannot be much of it left, but the Metinvest boss cautions that the pictures could be “misleading”, with many showing less important auxiliary units, not the key blast furnaces.

The brutality of the battle for Mariupol has contributed to international isolation of Russia. (Ryzhenkov praised Boris Johnson’s backing for Ukrainian victory, saying the UK prime minister was sending a “very powerful message, and we can hear it and feel it”.) Putin’s apparent aim was to control Ukraine, but the invasion has prompted Metinvest and many other key parts of the economy to turn decisively away from Moscow.

The company is even looking at options to produce more steel in the EU using Ukrainian commodities and Ryzhenkov hopes that Russian steel exports will be targeted by sanctions.

Links with Russia of any kind are off the cards for the “foreseeable future”, he says, and Metinvest will “absolutely not” operate from Russian-controlled territory. “Until [the] Russian regime changes, I don’t see how that can be restored.”",,[],['Jasper Jolly']

Decades of Resistance: An Indian Community’s Struggle Against a Polluting Steel Plant,"For two decades, the village of Dhinkia has pushed back against plans for destructive, polluting “development projects” in the area.

When news of the construction of another steel factory broke out, local communities in Dhinkia and in the surrounding villages were not surprised. They knew their precious fields, with their bright green plantations of betel vines, were going to be once again put up for sale. They knew profit, instead of their interests and their rights, was always going to come first. And they knew that if they dared to protest, they were going to be attacked. But no matter the risks, they were ready to go back to the streets and defend their land.

Dhinkia is a village located in the district of Jagatsinghpur, in the eastern coastal state of Odisha, India. The local people are mostly indigenous Adivasi and they mainly work as farmers and fisherfolk, heavily depending on their betel vineyards, rice and cashew plantations, and the fish caught in the Bay of Bengal.

For 12 years, they fiercely resisted the South Korean steel-making giant POSCO, which proposed building a controversial and polluting steel plant in their territory. At the time, the project would have been the largest foreign investment in the history of India. In March 2017, thanks to their powerful mobilization, they managed to force POSCO to back off: the company had to hand over to the government the land they had acquired.

The community’s victory, however, was short-lived. The Indian government, instead of giving the land back to the local communities, invited the Jindal Steel Works (JSW) group — an Indian-based multinational corporation — to set up a new mega-project in the same location. The proposed plan involves an integrated steel factory, with an associated port, a cement grinding facility, mines and power plants.

This so-called “development project” has been met with strong opposition from local communities in Dhinkia, Nuagaon, Govindpur and neighboring villages, and it is being imposed in clear violation of their right to free, prior and informed consent.

“We’ve seen what happened to other families displaced by similar projects, such as the people displaced by the IOCL refinery plant in Trilochanpur. Today they are in a state of misery. The money received as compensation is already gone, and the women are those suffering the most – as they have to do hard labor all day to support their families,” says Shanti Das, a villager from Dhinkia.

As soon as the local communities started to peacefully oppose the proposed project, the repression began. Local authorities have violently tried to curb the protests of what is now called the Anti-Jindal movement. Security forces are committing severe human rights violations, forcefully evicting local villagers, and criminalizing hundreds of people.

Since the end of 2021, the area around Dhinkia has been heavily militarized. Hundreds of police officers are constantly surveilling and harassing villagers, requiring them to show their IDs when going in and out the village, and attacking them during demonstrations. Tensions escalated on January 14. During a protest against forced evictions and the destruction of plantations, the police attacked a group of 500 villagers with metal sticks. Among the injured, there were also women, children and elderly.

Local authorities have also criminalized everyone who is involved in the protest movement. It is estimated that there are a total of 400 criminal cases still pending from the previous waves of mobilization against POSCO. Over the years authorities have issued warrants against 700 people, including 300 women.

Yet despite the risks they face, villagers are continuing their powerful struggle for their rights.

“This collective and united struggle, through the mobilization of local communities and international solidarity, is a powerful tool to resist the forceful land acquisition process pushed forward by corporations and the state. We have withstood all sorts of dirty tactics used by the state and the company to try and divide our community, and we have never been afraid of going to jail for protecting our land. We’ll continue resisting,” says one of the local human rights defenders.

The proposed project has also disregarded the standard environmental clearance procedure. Most of the land impacted by the factory is officially classified as forest land, and therefore should be protected and preserved. Yet, even though the environmental license has not been issued yet, work has already started.

In early 2022, some sand dunes and mangrove trees were damaged because of the initial work, and dozens of betel vine plants — the most lucrative crop in the region — were razed. Once fully in operation, the project risks polluting hundreds of hectares of precious, fertile land and causing serious environmental impacts, including exacerbating air pollution, sea erosion and droughts. In an area already impacted by climate emergencies, such as cyclones and floods, the JSW steel plant risks completely destroying the fragile ecosystem.

According to the international organization FIAN International, the factory will heavily impact the livelihoods of at least 40,000 farmers, agricultural workers and fishers. “This project won’t bring any benefit to local communities,” says Pratap Rudra Samantaray, a villager from Dhinkia. “The only ones supporting it are people who are not cultivating any land here and just want to receive some money, by hook or crook, without thinking about the future of the next generations.”

The project also violates India’s legal frameworks. According to the 2006 Forest Rights Act, industrial projects diverting protected forest resources need to secure the consent of the impacted communities, through resolutions taken in the Gram Sabhas (village councils). As reported by FIAN, on several occasions the Gram Sabhas of Dhinkia and nearby villages have passed majority resolutions against any handover of their lands and community forest resources, which are key to sustaining their livelihoods and a healthy environment. These resolutions have been routinely disregarded.

The people who joined the anti-Jindal Movement have been sitting in dharna, in protest, for months, and they are now mobilizing other communities across the region. They are determined to keep resisting, and said they won’t stop their protest till their demands are met and the project is withdrawn: “We know we are taking risks, but what choice do we have? Otherwise, we would have to leave this soil, this wind, this sky and the peace we enjoy here. We will not leave, this is our motherland,” says Shanti Das.",,[],[]

Let’s pin down the elusive ‘E’ of ESG transition finance,"Sustainable climate funding initiatives that broadly comprise the ‘E’ of ESG transition finance have for long been paid lip service to and perceived as assurers of mere bragging rights. Yet, as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) action assumes importance, change is in the air. Considering the frequency with which weather events are impacting lives and given our national commitment to net zero carbon emissions, India Inc—businesses, financiers and regulatory stakeholders—will do well to study the ‘whole-of-government’ approach and come up with a similar workable ‘whole-of-industry investment and financing’ approach to facilitate a sustainable economy.

While commendable capacities have come up for various forms of renewable power, including utility-scale solar power, financed through a pool of bank/financial institution loans, bonds and private equity, much more should be done to enhance investments in round-the-clock renewable energy (RTC RE) supply, as increasingly choosy corporates pursuing sustainability mandates demand 365x24x7 RE via better power storage technologies and energy generators. Further, systemic pain points that hold back the growth of wind and roof-top solar systems and other renewables require policy streamlining.

The development of robust transition finance mechanisms across various industry segments will be our litmus test over the next decade or two. The 3 ‘R’ mantra of recycle, re-use and reduce shall be crucial for principal segments of Indian Industry to combat climate challenges effectively.

Heavy industries like iron and steel can help reduce India’s carbon dioxide exhaust by undertaking incremental capacity expansion through smaller ‘scrap based steel process plants’ (recycling) located near urban centres, instead of adding pollution-heavy integrated factories with blast furnaces that convert ore to iron and basic oxygen furnaces that transform iron into steel. The big reward: scrap production process emissions would be only 0.15 tonnes of carbon per tonne of crude steel, as against the latter’s 2.5 tonnes of carbon per tonne of crude steel. Once deep decarbonization steel technologies develop on a commercial scale, including green hydrogen from electrolysis of water or blue hydrogen from natural gas (where carbon by-products get captured), polluting entities could choose to make the appropriate technology investments.

In the energy and commodities space where coal and hydrocarbons are necessities, refining companies that guzzle finance to the tune of $20-40 million for every imported tanker consignment, could do more, given the sheer scale of their operations. Business and corporate social responsibility support is needed to promote greener technologies and bring about a large CO2 impact. Projects like the afforestation of habitats and revival of lost water bodies need priority.

Power distribution companies can do their bit to support electric vehicle (EV) usage by upgrading back-end transformer infrastructure and raising the sanctioned loads of connections , which remain as low as 5 KWh, leaving little spare load for quick EV battery charging at most alternative-current plug-in points.

In the construction industry, rain water harvesting (RWH) systems should be a strict precondition for issuing building plan approvals to reverse groundwater depletion and prevent urban flooding. If water-challenged Tamil Nadu could successfully implement mandatory RWH for all buildings across urban and later rural areas in the early 2000s, surely such best practices require replication today in heavy consumption areas across the country.

If organizations don’t display enough initiative, regulations will probably tread the path taken by the state for dismantling LPG subsidies for well-off users. First, consumers were requested to give up subvention voluntarily and then the tap was forcibly turned off. Similarly, regulators will have no choice but to follow a 3 ‘C’ script. First coax, then convince and eventually coerce the laggards of India Inc, including financiers, to fall in line for hastening a green transition.

The revamped Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) framework, which requires listed corporates to disclose specific quantifiable metrics under standard templates, and the ESG assessment scores introduced by credit rating agencies, are early moves of this cajoling stage.

European banks like BNP Paribas have taken an early lead by coming out with climate analytics and alignment studies, specifying a carbon transition finance roadmap towards net zero. Recently, interim decarbonization percentage targets were set that envision raising the share of finance available to RE in overall power generation capacity, reducing upstream exposure to oil, and increasing the financing share of EVs in the automobile market by 2025. For these three, the reduced carbon intensity of bank finance can be measured in terms of grams per KWh, grams per mega joule and grams per kilometre driven, respectively. Indian banks need to follow suit by devising their own specific strategies. Most banks in India, however, haven’t yet framed comprehensive climate funding policies, while a few that have taken initial steps in that direction have held their drafted plans in abeyance.

A green economic transition and the financing needed for it should not be elusive buzzwords, but an opportunity that Indian corporates and financiers should act upon right away before climate action regulations start hitting them hard.

Global Turbocompressor Market

Global Turbocompressor Market

Dublin, June 15, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Turbocompressor Market by Type, Stage, and End User: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2021-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The global turbocompressor market size was $15,748.7 million in 2020, and is expected to reach $29,356.4 million by 2030, with a CAGR of 6.3% from 2021 to 2030.

A turbocompressor is a dynamic type of compressor used for the compression and injection of gases. In these compressors, the required pressure rise takes place during the continuous conversion of angular momentum imparted to the refrigerant vapor by a high-speed impeller into static pressure. The unique design and reliability of turbocompressors makes them applicable in industries where large amounts of air need to be compressed. Metallurgical, chemical, and petrochemical plants and refineries are amongst the most common applications for turbo compression solutions.



The major driving factor for the growth of the turbocompressor market is the rise in trade of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) in countries such as Australia and the U.S., which is promoting more use of the cleaner source of energy for different industries, such as generating electricity, manufacturing and heating industry. This is leading to the rise in trade of the liquefied natural gas over different countries and turbocompressor are used for the LNG for maintaining the pressure ratios. In addition, various government regulations over the use of cleaner energy such as the Clean Energy Act prompt the use of cleaner energy for different industries. In addition, for the wastewater plant applications, the turbocompressor are used to provide more efficiency to remove pollutants and requires less maintenance, which drives the growth of turbocompressor market.



However, in countries such as Japan and South Korea, due to warmer weathers the temperature in certain places is high and use of liquefied natural gas in such places is restricted as the use of LNG in such weather could lead to explosion. In addition, screw compressors provide an advantage over turbocompressors, as screw compressors provide greater efficiency over the part load and provide more capacity control over the output range. Hence, making the screw compressors getting more preferred over the turbocompressor, which restraints the growth of the turbocompressor market.



However, the demand for passenger vehicles increases over the years. With the growing electric vehicles market, the fuel vehicles provide more features such as increase in fuel efficiency by more than 10%. In addition, the turbocompressor used for diesel engines reduces the NOx that causes environmental pollution, which is increases the adoption of the thermocompressor. Various companies manufacture their own turbocompressors considering the diesel engines applications. In addition, the rise in the automotive industry with the increase in government regulations build new opportunities for the turbocompressor market.



The turbocompressor market is segmented into type, stage, end user, and region. On the basis of type, the market is divided into centrifugal and axial. On the basis of stage, the market is divided into single stage and multi-stage. On the basis of end user, the market is egmented into oil & gas, power generation, chemical, water & wastewater, and others.

Stellantis confirms layoffs at Sterling Heights stamping plant. Here's what we know,"Stellantis confirms layoffs at Sterling Heights stamping plant. Here's what we know

Jeep maker Stellantis NV will make indefinite layoffs at its stamping plant in Sterling Heights starting Monday, the automaker confirmed.

The company didn't specify how many workers will be affected by the layoff at the plant employing nearly 2,000 hourly workers making various parts for Ram trucks, Dodge and Jeep SUVs and Chrysler minivans.

""In order to operate the plant in a more sustainable manner,"" spokeswoman Ann Marie Fortunate said in a statement, ""Stellantis confirms that there will be indefinite layoffs at the Sterling Stamping Plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, effective June 20.""

The confirmation came after United Auto Workers Local 1264, which represents employees at the plant, posted on Facebook a letter from President LaShawn English alerting members of the plans for the layoff. The letter indicated layoffs will be done based on seniority, ""from the bottom up.""

Sterling Stamping Plant, at 35777 Van Dyke Road, employs 2,184 people, including salaried workers, according to Stellantis' website, which also claims the facility is the largest stamping plant in the world.

The plant produces stamping and assemblies for hoods, roofs, liftgates, side apertures, fenders and floor pans.

Unifor Local 444, the Canadian autoworkers union representing employees at Windsor Assembly Plant in Windsor, Ontario, on Tuesday also posted on Twitter that the Chrysler Pacifica plant will idle next week because of insufficient parts.

Sterling Stamping isn't alone in facing indefinite layoffs. The global microchip shortage and sluggish demand have resulted in indefinite shift cuts and layoffs at the Jeep Cherokee crossover plant in Belvidere, Illinois, and at Windsor Assembly. There, the company has extended the 1,800-person second shift through the end of the year, though a $2.8 billion commitment to Ontario facilities promises to return it to a three-shift operation in the coming years after retooling for an electrified platform starts next year.

The automaker in 2019 announced Sterling Stamping would receive a $160 million investment as a part of a $4.5 billion commitment to its plants in Michigan to support additional Jeep and Ram production. That was expected to create 80 jobs at the stamping plant.

It has 26 major lines of stamping presses ranging from 400 to 4,000 tons of capacity, according to Stellantis' website. The facility has a capacity of 480,000 tons of steel and 14,000 tons of aluminum annually, water storage capacity of 900,000 gallons, steam capacity of 300,000 pounds per hour and compressed air of 25,000 cubic feet per minute. Products ship inside the U.S. and to Canada, Mexico and Venezuela.

Russia claims advances in Ukraine amid fierce fighting,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia on Tuesday claimed to have taken control of 97% of one of the two provinces that make up Ukraine's Donbas, bringing the Kremlin closer to its goal of fully capturing the eastern industrial heartland of coal mines and factories.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow’s forces hold nearly all of Luhansk province. And it appears that Russia now occupies roughly half of Donetsk province, according to Ukrainian officials and military analysts.

After abandoning its bungled attempt to storm Kyiv two months ago, Russia declared that taking the entire Donbas is its main objective. Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian government forces in the Donbas since 2014, and the region has borne the brunt of the Russian onslaught in recent weeks.

Early in the war, Russian troops also took control of the entire Kherson region and a large part of the Zaporizhzhia region, both in the south. Russian officials and their local appointees have talked about plans for those regions to either declare their independence or be folded into Russia.

But in what may be the latest instance of anti-Russian sabotage inside Ukraine, Russian state media said Tuesday that an explosion at a cafe in the city of Kherson wounded four people. Tass called the apparent bombing in the Russian-occupied city a “terror act.”

Before the Feb. 24 invasion, Ukrainian officials said Russia controlled some 7% of the country, including the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, and areas held by the separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces hold 20% of the country.

While Russia has superior firepower, the Ukrainian defenders are entrenched and have shown the ability to counterattack.

While insisting on Ukraine’s need to defeat Russia on the battlefield, Zelenskyy said at a Financial Times conference Tuesday that he is still open to peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

But a former senior U.S. intelligence officer said the time isn’t right.

“You’re not going to get to the negotiating table until neither side feels they have an advantage that they could push,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor of the Washington-based Center for a New American Security.

The Russians “think they will be able to take the whole of the Donbas and then might use that as the opportunity to call for negotiations,” Kendall-Taylor said at an online seminar organized by Columbia and New York universities.

Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, said Moscow's forces have seized the residential quarters of Sievierodonetsk and are fighting to take control of an industrial zone on the city's outskirts and nearby towns.

Sievierodonetsk and nearby Lysychansk have seen heavy fighting in recent weeks. They are among a few cities and towns in the Luhansk region still holding out against the Russian invasion, which is being helped by local pro-Kremlin forces.

Shoigu added that Russian troops were pressing their offensive toward the town of Popasna and have taken control of Lyman and Sviatohirsk and 15 other towns in the region.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak urged his people not to be downhearted about the battlefield reverses.

“Don’t let the news that we’ve ceded something scare you,” he said in a video address. “It is clear that tactical maneuvers are ongoing. We cede something, we take something back.""

Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai conceded that Russian forces control the industrial outskirts of Sievierodonetsk.

“The toughest street battles continue, with varying degrees of success,” Haidai said. “The situation constantly changes, but the Ukrainians are repelling attacks.”

Moscow’s forces also kept up their artillery barrage of Lysychansk. Haidai said Russian troops shelled a market, a school and a college building, destroying the latter. At least three people were wounded, he said.

“A total destruction of the city is under way. Russian shelling has intensified significantly over the past 24 hours. Russians are using scorched-earth tactics,” Haidai said.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military has begun training Ukrainian forces on the sophisticated multiple rocket launchers that the Biden administration agreed last week to provide. The Pentagon said the training is going on at a base in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.

The High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, is mounted on a truck and can carry a container with six rockets, which can travel about 45 miles (70 kilometers). Officials said it would take about three weeks of training before they could go to the battlefront.

The war also brought a standoff Tuesday between the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency and Ukrainian authorities over the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe.

The director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, wants to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant to help maintain its safety after it was taken by Russian troops in March.

But Energoatom, the Ukrainian state company overseeing the country’s nuclear plants, said in a blunt statement that Grossi isn’t welcome. It said his planned tour is “yet another attempt to legitimize the occupier’s presence there.”

Amid fears of a global food crisis because of the war, the Kremlin said Ukraine needs to remove sea mines near its Black Sea port of Odesa to allow essential grain exports to resume from there. Ukrainian officials have expressed concern that removing the mines could enable Moscow’s forces to attack.

Behind almost every shortage and price spike is a bungled government policy,"OPINION:

In a market economy, persistent shortages of goods and services are not supposed to occur, unlike in socialist economies. In free markets, if demand begins to exceed the supply for something, producers will raise prices until the point where supply and demand are in equilibrium. The higher prices serve to motivate sellers to produce more, and to allocate scarce resources to avoid shortages. There can be temporary supply shocks, where a critical raw material becomes scarce because of a flood, drought, earthquake, war or what have you. But normally producers quickly adjust and find ways to meet demand.

How then can we have persistent shortages in toilet paper — a product invented more than 150 years ago — when there is no shortage of trees? Insulin was invented a century ago and is critical for the world’s 537 million diabetics (37 million in the U.S. alone), and the price has been soaring and now costs 10 times more in the U.S. than in any other developed country. The world, and particularly the U.S., is awash with oil and gas, yet prices have tripled in the last couple of years and are at record highs. There has been a global shortage of semiconductor chips — particularly, high-end chips. Baby formula — a product made for decades — is suddenly all but unobtainable in many places.

In communist and socialist countries, production decisions are made by state bureaucrats, who often make incorrect forecasts, resulting in shortages of things people need and want and surpluses of things for which there is little demand.

In a market economy, a lack of competition — too few competitors or competitors that collude with each other — can lead to higher prices and less innovation. This is why monopolies, and many organized collusive oligopolies, are often deemed illegal. A large body of “antitrust” law has developed to deal with the perceived problem. The government antitrusters have often missed the mark by attacking companies that posed little or no danger, while totally missing real dangers to the system.

Decades ago, when I took my first course in antitrust, the big fear was that GM would monopolize the auto industry. (That was just before many foreign auto companies opened plants in the U.S., almost destroying Detroit.) Another fear was that IBM would monopolize the computer industry — just before more innovative companies like Apple, Microsoft and Intel almost drove IBM into bankruptcy. And then there was the worry that U.S. Steel (a company few are aware even exists) would monopolize the steel industry.

Government is all too often responsible for the lack of competition in many industries because of regulations, patent and other intellectual property provisions, trade agreements and subsidies, and political attacks on the industry.

President Biden, before being elected, said he was going to shut down the oil, gas and coal industries for environmental reasons. He then appointed many people to his administration who are very hostile to the industry and are issuing endless costly rules, not only on production but also on the refiners, distributors and oil transporters. Given the situation, it should be no surprise that there is less new investment in the oil and gas industry, and prices have soared.

Mr. Biden likes to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for the high prices, but the Russians are producing huge amounts of oil, while loving the high prices that Mr. Biden’s policies have caused. Mr. Biden is enriching the Saudis and the Russians while impoverishing American consumers. His policies cause more dirty oil to be produced by foreign countries at the expense of cleaner American oil. It is hard to be more wrong and mean-spirited than that.

Much of the pharmaceutical industry has produced off-shore for decades, putting U.S. consumers at risk from potentially hostile foreign actors like China. For many drugs, there are only a very few producers — often because existing patent holders have found legal ways of extending their intellectual property protections for even decades. Global insulin production has been almost entirely controlled by three companies — Novo Nordisk (Denmark), Lilly (USA) and Sanofi (France). In March 2021, the U.S. FDA introduced an interchangeability regulation that is easing market entry for other companies.

West Virginia has had an acute problem with diabetes, where 16% of the adult population is suffering from it. The average gross cost of insulin last year in the U.S. was $6,459 per patient, which hits a poor state like West Virginia particularly hard. Last week, there was very good news when UNDBIO, a South Korean company, announced it was launching a facility for producing insulin in West Virginia. The state of West Virginia is supporting the effort with tax and other incentives, which is expected to create 1,200 new jobs in Morgantown.

Subsidizing the creation of new competitors is less than an ideal solution, but far superior to the Biden administration’s proposals for price controls. Price controls almost always lead to shortages, black markets and corruption.

Behind almost every shortage and price spike is some bungled government policy. Other than less government regulation in general, there is no simple solution other than to take on each market impediment one by one. The solutions to all of the shortages listed are known. It is not rocket science — it is common sense.

"Steel can power UK’s energy ambitions, says Severfield boss","Steel can power UK’s energy ambitions, says Severfield boss

Steel has a vital role in boosting the UK’s energy infrastructure and could help power the transition to a greener economy, argued Severfield chief executive Alan Dunsmore.

The steel boss told City A.M. that the main opportunity in a market defined by challenging headwinds such as inflation and supply chain disruption was in the growth of domestic infrastructure.

He said: “I think the main opportunity is around infrastructure growth and investment, and the transition to a green economy. There are a lot of options there…particularly in nuclear power.”

Severfield is the UK’s largest steel contractor, trading on the London Stock Exchange, and is hoping to benefit from Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s ‘big new bet’ on nuclear.

The government is pushing to green-light eight new reactors by the end of the decade – with Sizewell C set to benefit from taxpayer support as part of its latest funding model.

Earlier this year, Downing Street unveiled its supply security strategy – targeting a ramp-up in nuclear power generation from 7GW to 24GW over the next three decades – alongside a wider expansion in domestic energy production following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Steel is a key component in the construction of nuclear power plants, and is also used in the production of wind turbines, solar panels and hydrogen power alongside North Sea oil and gas exploration and drilling.

Dunsmore concluded: “The green agenda could drive the long-term sustainability and viability of steel, as the product is endlessly recyclable.”

Commenting on current challenges in the industry, he also said the sector has been used to headwinds to navigate over the past five to six years since the UK voted to leave the European Union.

Severfield has sought to reduce its exposure to challenges over the past eight years through expanding its options for producing fabricated steel – to ensure it is not overly dependent on anyone supplier.

He explained: “We’ve spent a lot of time just broadening and diversifying our supply options and making sure that we can react to whatever happens,”

Severfield revels in record order book as demand rebounds from pandemic

Dunsmore was speaking with City A.M. following the release of Severfield’s full-year results, which revealed strong revenues and profits powered by a record order book.

Revenues had risen 11 per cent to £403.6m, while underlying profit had also increased 11 per cent to £27.1m, with the company raising its total dividend seven per cent to 3.1p per share.

The firm has navigated the choppy waters of the pandemic, the energy crisis and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine thanks to a rebounding appetite in construction – enjoying a record UK and Europe order book totalling £486m – up from £393m in November.

Its orders includes a film studio, an industrial centre and the upcoming new stadium for Everton Football Club.

The company has kept its outlook of £31m in pre-tax profits next year unchanged, with £397m of its hefty order book deliverable in the next 12 months.

Severfield’s expansion into India has also gathered pace, with its order book growing to £158m, reflecting strong underlying demand for structural steel in India

The company has also revealed the successful completion of a new £50m revolving credit facility maturing in December 2026.

Its performance is a bright spot for a troubled industry, with GFG Alliance’s legal sojourn suffering another set back last week, after Sanjeev Gupta failed in his last-ditch attempt to get a winding-up order thrown out after Credit Suisse.

The Swiss investment group started insolvency hearings against the group’s companies last month.

This also follows the collapse of Greensill Capital last year – one of GFG Alliance’s biggest backers.

Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has also been weighing up the possibility of cutting steel producers out of network charges to help ease the pain of spiralling energy prices.

Harry Philips, investment analyst Peel Hunt, has maintained the investment group’s ‘Buy’ stance, with a target price of 100p.

He said: “Severfield has an evolving strategy that will enable it to be more readily aligned with growth – it has been already but it will become clearer to see; it has developed a good track record with infill acquisitions so more would be a plus; and India is on the cusp of making a significant step forward on the profit line that can accelerate value or partial realisation – the latter aspect is simply not reflected in the share price. “

What Happened on Day 83 of the War in Ukraine,"A couple in Bucha, Ukraine, last Wednesday. The city outside of Kyiv has been working hard to clear debris from the Russian occupation.

BUCHA, Ukraine — A breeze rustles through the cherry blossoms in bloom on almost every block in this small city, the white petals fluttering onto streets where new pavement covers damage left by Russian tanks just weeks ago.

Spring has arrived in Bucha in the six weeks since Russian soldiers withdrew from this bedroom community outside Kyiv, leaving behind mass graves of slaughtered citizens, many of them mutilated, as well as broken streets and destroyed buildings.

A semblance of normal life has returned to the city. Residents have been coming back to Bucha over the past few weeks, and the city has raced to repair the physical damage wrought by the invading Russian troops and their weapons. Now, on the leafy springtime streets of the city, it is hard to imagine the horrors that unfolded here.

On a newly paved street with freshly painted white lines, the rotating brushes of a street cleaning machine whisked away what was left of shattered glass and bits of iron shrapnel. In one of the neighborhoods where many of the roughly 400 bodies of Ukrainian citizens were discovered in April, technicians were laying cable to restore internet service. At one house, a resident was removing pieces of destroyed Russian tanks still littering his garden.

Sweeping away as many traces as possible of the destruction caused by the Russian occupation was an important step in healing the wounds suffered by Bucha’s residents, said Taras Shapravsky, a City Council official.

Mr. Shapravsky said 4,000 residents had stayed in the city while it was occupied, terrified and many hiding in basements without enough food. Even after the Russian soldiers withdrew, many residents remained traumatized.

“They were in very bad psychological condition,” he said. “Specialists explained to us that the faster we clear away all possible reminders of the war, the faster we will be able to take people out of this condition.”

Mr. Shapravsky said phone reception was restored a few days after the Russians left, and then water and electricity. He said about 10,000 residents had returned so far — roughly a quarter of the prewar population of this small city 20 miles from Kyiv, the capital.

In a sign of life returning to normal, he said the marriage registration office reopened last week and almost every day, couples are applying for marriage licenses.

Bucha was a city where many people moved to for quieter lifestyles, a place where they could raise families away from the bustle of the capital, to which many commuted to work. It was a place where people from Kyiv might drive to on a nice weekend to have lunch.

Six years ago, Sergo Markaryan and his wife opened the Jam Cafe, where they served Italian food, played old jazz and sold jars of jam. He described the cafe as almost like their child, and he has decorated it with an eclectic mix of hundreds of pictures and strings of photos of customers.

When Russia invaded, Mr. Markaryan, 38, drove his wife and 3-year-old son to the border with Georgia, where he is from. As a Georgian citizen he could have stayed outside the country, but he came back to Ukraine to volunteer, sending food to the front lines.

Two weeks ago, when the electricity was restored, Mr. Markaryan came back on his own to Bucha to see what was left of the cafe and repair the damage caused by the Russian soldiers.

“They stole the knives and forks,” he said, ticking off missing items. He said the soldiers dragged the dining chairs out to use at checkpoints and stole the sound system. And, he said, despite the working toilets, they had defecated on the floor before leaving.

Two days before it was due to reopen last week, the cafe and its outdoor terrace looked spotless and Mr. Markaryan was taste-testing the espresso to see if it was up to par.

“Many people have already returned but some are still afraid,” Mr. Markaryan said. “But we have all definitely become much stronger than we were. We faced things that we never thought could happen.”

On the other side of town, in a row of closed shops with peaked roofs and boarded-up windows, Mr. B — a former cocktail bar run by Borys Tkachenko has been patched up and turned into a coffee bar.

Mr. Tkachenko, 27, came back to Bucha a month ago, repaired the roof, which like most of the buildings on the street appeared to have been damaged by shrapnel, and found that the espresso machine was still there. He reopened to sell coffee — or in the case of customers who were soldiers or medical workers, give it away.

Mr. Tkachenko, who had worked in clubs in Florida and Canada and studied the hotel business in Switzerland, opened the bar with his savings last December. Russia invaded two months later.

He said he knew they had to leave when his 14-month-old daughter started running around their apartment, covering her ears and saying “boom, boom, boom” at the sound of explosions.

Mr. Tkachenko drove his family to the border with Slovakia, where they eventually made their way to Switzerland. He returned to Ukraine to volunteer, helping to send supplies to the front and to displaced civilians.

“We had big plans for this place,” Mr. Tkachenko, who despite everything had a wide smile that matched a tattoo on his arm reading, “Born to be happy,” said of his bar.

He said that when the war ended he would probably join his wife and daughter in Switzerland.

“I don’t see a future here right now,” he said.

While the frenetic activity of city workers and residents has helped clear the city of much of the debris of the Russian occupation, the scars of what happened here run deep.

On one quiet street corner, a bunch of dandelions and lilies of the valley had been laid out on a flowered scarf in a modest sidewalk memorial.

Volodymyr Abramov, 39, said the memorial honored his brother-in-law, Oleh Abramov, who was taken out of his house at gunpoint by Russian soldiers, ordered to kneel and shot. (Oleh Abramov and his wife, Iryna, were the subject of a Times article published this month.)

“He was not even interrogated,” he said.

Mr. Abramov’s home was destroyed by Russian soldiers who tossed grenades into his house. But he said that was nothing compared with the suffering of his 48-year-old sister, Iryna Abramova, who lost her husband as well as her house.

“I try to help her and take care of her so she doesn’t kill herself,” he said. “I tell her that her husband is watching her from heaven.”

Mr. Abramov, a glazier, said he was now wondering if he should rebuild his house. “I want to run away from here,” he said.

Outside the city’s morgue, where French and Ukrainian investigators are still working to identify bodies from the massacres by Russian troops, a small group of residents gathered, hoping to find out what happened to family members.

Yulia Monastyrska, 29, said she had come to try to get a death certificate for her husband, whose body was among those discovered in April. His hands were bound, he had been shot in the back and the legs, and one of his eyes was burned out, she said.

Ms. Monastyrska said her husband, Ivan, was a crane operator who disappeared while she and her 7-year-old daughter, Oleksandra, hid in the basement of their apartment building.

Oleksandra, wearing glasses and sneakers with princesses on them, leaned against her mother as she listened to details that were clearly now familiar to her.

“As far as I know, everyone wants to come back here, but they are still afraid,” Ms. Monastyrska said. “We were born here, we lived here, a lot of good things happened here.”

Yulia Kozak, 48, accompanied by her daughter Daryna, 23, and Daryna’s 3-year-old son, Yehor, had come to take a DNA test to see if there was a match among the unidentified remains of her missing son, Oleksandr, 29, who had fought in the war against Russia in 2017.

Prosecutors found his military ID, dirty and moldy, in a basement where the Russians held prisoners.

Sobbing, she said the last time she spoke by phone with her son, in March, he had told her he was being shot at. In his apartment, there is a bullet hole in the window, on which the sign of the cross had been etched.

Ms. Kozak, a cook, said she planned to stay in Bucha until she found her son.

“I am sure he is alive, 100 percent sure,” she said. “I feel that he is somewhere, I just don’t know where.”",,[],"['Valerie Hopkins', 'Marc Santora', 'Ivan Nechepurenko', 'Rick Gladstone', 'Erin Mendell', 'Alexandra Petri', 'David Bolaños', 'Nicole Tung', 'Anushka Patil', 'Aurelien Breeden']"
"How Extreme Heat Kills, Sickens, Strains and Ages Us","There also haven’t been enough studies, Dr. Huber said, on living full time in a warmer world, instead of just experiencing the occasional roasting summer. “We don’t know what the long-term consequences of getting up every day, working for three hours in nearly deadly heat, sweating like crazy and then going back home are,” he said.

The growing urgency of these issues is drawing in researchers, like Dr. Kenney, who didn’t always think of themselves as climate scientists. For a recent study, he and his colleagues placed young, healthy men and women in specially designed chambers, where they pedaled an exercise bike at low intensity. Then the researchers dialed up the heat and humidity.

They found that their subjects started overheating dangerously at much lower “wet-bulb” temperatures — a measure that accounts for both heat and mugginess — than what they had expected based on previous theoretical estimates by climate scientists.

Effectively, under steam-bath conditions, our bodies absorb heat from the environment faster than we can sweat to cool ourselves down. And “unfortunately for humans, we don’t pump out a lot more sweat to keep up,” Dr. Kenney said.",,[],['Raymond Zhong']
Take a look inside the demolition of Lakeland Electric's McIntosh power plants,"Take a look inside the demolition of Lakeland Electric's McIntosh power plants

LAKELAND — Lakeland Electric's largest demolition project to date is getting underway off the shores of Lake Parker. Residents can expect to see changes this week.

The city's third-party contractor, Total Wrecking & Environmental, arrived on the site May 23. This kick starts a nearly year and a half process to dismantle three units at the utility's C.D. McIntosh Power Plant.

""'First and foremost, No. 1, is safety of our employees and people in the community,"" said David Holdener, Lakeland Electric's power production projects coordinator. ""No. 2 is being environmentally conscious.""

Lakeland Electric hired the New-York-based demolition company to oversee dismantling of three power plants:

Unit 1, a 90-megawatt oil burner converted to run on natural gas.

Unit 2, a dual fuel 114.7 megawatt steam-turbine run on oil or natural gas decommissioned after a violent explosion in May 2017.

Unit 3, a 360-megawatt coal-powered generator that ran from 1982 to April 4, 2021.

Mike Dammer, Lakeland Electric engineer and project lead for demolition, said Total Wrecking has spent the first weeks in the salvage phase. Its employees have been focused on finding valuable metals or used parts that can be resold for a profit. The contractor signed a contract with Lakeland to pay up to $1.2 million for the demolition and rights to scrap.

Previously: Lakeland could make $1.2 million on demolition of power plants

Rising rates: Customers likely to see higher bills as Lakeland Electric seeks to raise fuel rate

A Polk sales tax?: Traffic and road conditions continue to worsen in Polk County. Is a sales tax increase the fix?

Mounds of black coated wire stripped from the cooling towers has been thrown at the base of McIntosh's Unit 3. Dammer said the contractor plans to set up machines in the utility's warehouse to strip the protective coating away from the copper wiring. Sale of this scrap copper will be one of the contractor's early revenue streams, Dammer said.

Lakeland Electric employees have already swept through the site taking a limited amount of equipment that the utility can use for spare parts or its repowering efforts. The utility has been working since January 2021 to reroute controls for its other locations from Unit 3 to McIntosh Unit 5's control room at the north end of the site.

""Everything was tied to Unit 3. It was the mothership. It was the baseload of generation,"" Holdener said.

Unit 3's control room now looks like something out of a bygone era. The hallway leading in has monitors that once printed the latest updates on power production on paper with perforated edges. Inside, a long and narrow room has hundreds of dials, gauges and light up buttons. Papers scattered across the table tops and tacked to a board are long forgotten. Some instruments have been stripped for environmental remediation because they contained mercury, Dammer said.

Cathryn Lacy, Lakeland Electric's spokesperson, said some of the more historic signs have been taken for preservation. Some of these items will be loaned or given to the Lakeland History and Cultural Center for a future exhibition.

Red, spray-painted X's mark doors and walls throughout the power plant's structure. The marking indicates areas where asbestos has been identified by the contractor and needs to be removed before demolition work can proceed.

""We have had numerous abatement projects over the year to remove a large quantity of asbestos,"" Dammer said. ""What we have left is minimal given the age of the plant.""

Among the first structures to be dismantled will be the cooling towers for Units 2 and 3, Dammer said. One is a small, rectangular structure with four stacks. The coal plant's is a long structure with 13 short stacks that is larger than a football field with a smaller two-stack building. These structures are highly visible on the northeast shore of Lake Parker.

""The really neat thing for people who live around Lake Parker is you are going to see green all the way across,"" Lacy said. ""Just living here, your view is going to improve.""

It will mark the start of dramatic changes along Lake Parker's landscape.

Dammer said the gradual demolition of attached Units 1 and 2 is scheduled to start in July. The contractor's tentative plans are to use cable wires to ""kneel,"" or lay the power plants down on the ground before mechanically dismantling them. Sale of this scrap steel will provide another source of revenue for Total Wrecking, Dammer said.

Later in the process, Lakeland residents will get an explosive view. Dammer said the current timeline puts the implosion of Unit 3's stack and boiler in the second quarter of 2023.

""Those are basically the things that are going to be imploded. The rest of the stuff can kind of being taken down,"" Holdener said.

The utility company tentatively has plans to establish areas where residents and the media will be able to view the explosion from a safe distance, Lacy said. All materials should be contained on the utility's site.

Lakeland Electric plans to keep using the switch yard that's part of its transmission and distribution lines adjacent to Unit 3, Dammer said. The utility plans to keep the large double pipeline once used to transport cooling water for the coal-powered generator in place until after the explosions as a form of protection. The contractor must also provide additional barriers to ensure it is not damaged during demolition.

The coal trestle spanning Lake Parker Drive that was used to convey fuel to Unit 3 will be among the last structures left standing. Dammer said the plan is to cut it to pieces and use pincers to remove it section by section.

Demolition is expected to be finished by the end of 2023, Dammer said. It will eliminate about 75% to 80% of all Lakeland Electric's structures on the southern half of its McIntosh site. The schedule remains flexible.

EU proposals on Emissions Trading and Carbon Border Adjustment derail the green transition,"The European steel industry is a strategic sector for the EU’s green transition, economic resilience and independence. We have clear plans and concrete projects to reduce our sector’s CO2 emissions by at least 30 percent by 2030 and to achieve climate-neutral steel production in the European Union by 2050. These commitments represent a truly industrial revolution that requires a massive €30 billion capital investment in breakthrough technologies over the coming eight years and a significant increase in operational costs stemming from the use of decarbonized electricity and hydrogen.

However, European legislators are now considering proposals on the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that undermine our capacity to invest in these projects and derail the transition to green steel production in Europe.

In Europe, new allocation rules will suddenly reduce the main CO2 benchmark by around 40 percent.

via EUROFER

The proposals weaken carbon-leakage protection of our industry in the domestic and global markets, favoring international competitors which are not subject to equivalent carbon costs. In Europe, new allocation rules will suddenly reduce the main CO2 benchmark by around 40 percent — because of one plant that was previously not in the scope — and set a value which no company can achieve in just three years. This is due to a premature transition from the free allocation and indirect cost compensation system to a CBAM which has not yet been tested. Circumvention and resource shuffling are only a few of the many risks that could undermine the CBAM’s effectiveness. Moreover, the CBAM does not yet foresee any measure to preserve the EU’s 20 million metric tons of steel exports per year, worth €45 billion, and the 30,000 jobs that are directly dependent on these.

The proposals also remove massive allowances from the market, further driving the carbon and electricity price in Europe at a time when businesses and households are struggling with skyrocketing energy costs and inflation. Finally, they fail to capture the much higher carbon footprint of stainless steel imports derived from the embedded alloying elements.

Avoid further scaling back existing carbon-leakage protection until the CBAM has proven its effectiveness and a solution for exports is in place.

We call on the European Parliament and Council to immediately address these concerns and in particular to:

● Avoid further scaling back existing carbon-leakage protection until the CBAM has proven its effectiveness and a solution for exports is in place.

● Prevent a sharp decrease in free allocation for existing steel plants which would result from a modification of the benchmark scope. Instead, low-carbon technologies must be rewarded without reducing prematurely benchmark values, at least in the first years when such technologies are introduced at an industrial scale.

The aforementioned changes to the ETS and CBAM will allow us to make the green steel transformation happen now within the EU. Our investments will greatly benefit climate protection, the EU’s industrial competitiveness and hundreds of thousands of jobs across the EU.

"Without Cheap Russian Energy, Some European Factories Are Shutting Down","Industrial energy costs are soaring in the wake of Russia's war on Ukraine, hobbling European manufacturers' ability to compete globally

For decades, European industry relied on Russia to supply low-cost oil and natural gas that kept the continent's factories humming.

Now Europe's industrial energy costs are soaring in the wake of Russia's war on Ukraine, hobbling manufacturers' ability to compete in the global marketplace.

Factories are scrambling to find alternatives to Russian energy under threat that Moscow could abruptly turn off the gas spigot, bringing production to a halt.

Europe's producers of chemicals, fertilizer, steel and other energy-intensive goods have come under pressure over the last eight months as tensions with Russia climbed ahead of the February invasion.

Some producers are shutting down in the face of competition from factories in the U.S., the Middle East and other regions where energy costs are much lower than in Europe.

Natural-gas prices are now nearly three times higher in Europe than in the U.S.

""Overall, the big concern for Europe is increasing imports and falling exports,"" said Marco Mensink, director general of Cefic, Europe's chemical-industry trade group.

The conflict with Russia has Europe preparing to ration gas if Russian President Vladimir Putin shuts off supplies to the entire region.

Russian state-owned natural-gas company Gazprom PJSC has already cut off Bulgaria, Finland and Poland after the countries refused to accede to a Kremlin decree demanding payment for gas in rubles.

As of last year, Russia supplied about 40% of the European Union's natural gas.

Europe's high energy costs are forecast to drag on the region's industrial production and overall economic growth this year.

Economists at the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, expect the German economy to shrink in the second quarter under pressure from high energy prices.

Germany, the region's largest economy, is also the biggest buyer of Russian natural gas.

Europe's consumers are unlikely to pick up the slack, as high energy costs are filtering through into prices across the economy, sapping their purchasing power.

The phaseout of Russian supplies risks putting European industry at a long-term competitive disadvantage unless manufacturers can deploy technologies that will sharply reduce their fossil-fuel consumption.

But many of those technologies, such as using wind and solar energy to power chemical factory furnaces or hydrogen to make steel, are years from becoming commercially viable and will require massive investments, executives say.

Manufacturers depend on natural gas both as a source of energy and a raw material in production. In Europe, natural gas usually sets the price of electricity, hitting factories with a double-whammy if gas prices increase.

Ammonia is the most sensitive product, accounting for around 70% of the gas Europe uses as a raw material. Most of that ammonia is used to make fertilizer.

Whether companies can adapt to Europe's surging energy prices depends on whether they can draw from production sites across the globe.

OCI NV, a fertilizer producer based in Amsterdam, has lowered ammonia production at its factory in the Netherlands and is instead importing the chemical from its plants in Texas, Egypt and Algeria, said chief executive Ahmed El-Hoshy.

The company is still completing the final steps of fertilizer production in the Netherlands.

Moves by energy-hungry industries to throttle production have relieved short-term pressure on Europe's natural-gas supplies, freeing up more gas for Europe to generate electricity and heat homes through the next winter, when officials expect gas supplies will be tight.

OCI usually only imports significant quantities of ammonia to Europe in winter when gas prices are highest.

""Now every month is a winter month,"" Mr. El-Hoshy said.

Other fertilizer manufacturers have decided to shut down factories that can't import ammonia from overseas.

CF Industries Holdings Inc., the U.K.'s largest fertilizer producer, said last week that it would permanently shut a plant that hadn't been producing ammonia since last year.

""As a high-cost producer in an intensely competitive global industry, we see considerable challenges to long-term sustainability from our current operational approach,"" said Brett Nightingale, managing director of the company's British subsidiary.

European steelmakers have been curtailing production since October to save money on gas and electricity. In March, soaring electricity prices in Spain led steelmakers there to lower output or shut down completely.

""This is absolutely crazy,"" said Miguel Ferrandis Torres, chief financial officer of Madrid-based Acerinox SA, which shut one of its production lines for three days in March.

Industries have been lobbying European authorities and governments to assure they will keep getting gas from somewhere if Russia stops shipping the fuel.

""With Mr. Putin, nobody knows what is going to happen,"" said Jacob Hansen, director general of Fertilizers Europe, the industry's main lobby group. ""We cannot produce any fertilizer without gas. We have to insist that we come right at the top.""

If Russia halts the gas flow to Germany, the country would give priority to private households as well as critical services such as hospitals, police stations and military barracks, but large industrial players could face rationing and disruptions, putting thousands of jobs at risk.

The decision of who gets gas in Europe's largest economy would fall to the Bonn-based Federal Network Agency, the country's energy regulator.

The agency, which has established a war room equipped with a diesel stockpile, showers, camp beds and food supplies, where a 65-strong crisis team is expected to work around the clock in such an emergency, would decide based on gas-usage data it is currently collecting from companies.

""We'll take a look at how specific companies can deal with it, which companies can live with gas interruptions and reductions, and which companies definitely cannot,"" said Klaus Muller, the president of the agency.

Mr. Muller and his team will also look at factors such as geographical distribution of the industrial players and how to transport the gas to them.

""We try to anticipate all of these factors, but that's not a good situation to be facing,"" he said.

Europe's chemical makers rely on natural gas to operate crackers, the large furnaces that separate oil and natural gas into constituent chemicals under immense heat and pressure.

Cefic's Mr. Mensink said the industry is researching ways to power the process with electricity but said the technology wouldn't be ready for commercial use before 2030.

Factories want to replace gas-powered electricity with electricity from renewables, but the supply of wind and solar power isn't enough to meet demand, he said.

""We are trying to get as much as we can for our production, but the reality is that Europe will have to invest and build much more,"" Mr. Mensink said.

European steelmakers are pledging to overhaul their factories to run on hydrogen rather than natural gas as raw material.

""Gas supplies other than from Russia will remain crucial as long as no hydrogen infrastructure at affordable costs is available,"" said Axel Eggert, director general of European steel lobby group Eurofer.",,[],['Bangkok Post Public Company Limited']
Chinese firm to build engine manufacturing facility for IMI,"SepcoIII, working with Aramco, one of four jv partners at International Maritime Industries (IMI), will manufacture two and four-stroke marine and electric power plant engines, in addition to marine pumps for ships, auxiliary equipment, generators and propulsion systems, a report in Arab News said last week, citing the Middle East Economic Digest (MEED).

"Union Government hell-bent on privatising Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, alleges CPI(M)","‘VSP withstood the onslaught and registered a profit of ₹582 crore in the last financial year’

‘VSP withstood the onslaught and registered a profit of ₹582 crore in the last financial year’

Coming down heavily on the Union government, CPI(M) State Secretariat Member Ch. Narasinga Rao alleged that the government was working against the health of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.

Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, he said that despite the efforts by the Union Government to privatise the plant, VSP has withstood the onslaught and registered a profit of ₹582 crore in the last financial year.

He pointed out that since January 2022, the price of steel has gone up from ₹45,000 to ₹90,000 per tonne. But when other steel plants were minting money, the VSP has been asked to reduce its production, he alleged.

He pointed out that out of the three blast furnaces, one has been shutdown and another one has been made to work at reduced capacity and out of six rolling mills, four has been asked to shutdown.

Mr Narasinga Rao alleged that the Central Government has also not approved the functioning of the sixth Coke Oven battery.

Even the Steel Melting Shop is working at 70% capacity.

He alleged that the Central Government has ordered the production of steel blooms which are sold at ₹45,000 per tonne, instead of the steel rods which are sold at ₹80,000 per tonne. This stands as a testimony to the attitude of the Central Government, he said.

The CPI (M) leader alleged that the Union Government has threatened the management to fall in line, failing which it would appoint a steel joint secretary through the Niti Aayog to run the show.

He also alleged that the Union Government has altered the practice of paying off the dues after meeting the funds for raw material, working capital and wages, by asking VSP to pay off the dues first. Because of this move, the plant is facing shortage of funds to buy iron ore and coal, which is affecting the production, he said.

The CPI (M) leader also alleged that both the State and the Union Governments were eyeing the 9,000 acres of land bank of the plant.

The land is required for future expansion, as the plant has the capacity to be expanded from the present 7.3 million tonnes to 20 million tonnes.

“The Steel Secretary, on his visit to Vijayawada on June 1, tried to meet the union leaders on this issue, but cancelled the meeting after sensing the vehement opposition from the unions,” he informed the media.

‘Forced to invest in bad projects’

He also alleged that the Union Government had forced VSP to invest in bad projects to drain its resources.

The plant was made to invest to the tune of ₹1,500 crore in a rail wheel plant at Raebareli. But now the government has given the orders for wheels to a Chinese company for the 400 Vande Bharat trains. Similarly, it was forced to invest over ₹1,000 crore in Odisha Mining Development Corporation, but not a single tonne of ore has reached the plant in the last 15 years.

Mr. Narasinga Rao also pointed out the allotment of iron ore mines to VSP was also cancelled and the plant has to buy ore from the open market by spending over ₹2,000 crore extra per year.

“We condemn this attitude and if the Union Government does not change its tack, all political parties, trade unions and the people will be compelled to tread the path of agitation,” he said. Party district secretary K. Lokanadham was present.",,[],[]
Is the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant agitation losing its steam?,"There is a lack of strong support from MPs to the stir, say Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee leaders

There is a lack of strong support from MPs to the stir, say Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee leaders

In January 2021, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the 100% strategic sale of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), the corporate entity of Visakhapatnan Steel Plant. Since then, the employees and union members from various political fronts have been staging an agitation, which at one point of time had scaled a good height.

But of late, the tempo of the agitation appears to have slowed down, especially at a time when the Union Government had already appointed the legal advisory committee and the transaction advisory committee. It has also recently short-listed three firms from 10 companies who had bid for the appointment of the valuation committee.

“It appears that the agitation is losing its steam, and we need to revive it as soon as possible,” feel many of the leaders from various trade unions, who are also part of the Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee (VUPPC).

VUPPC is the umbrella committee consisting of all unions and employees that has taken up the fight against the privatisation move.

One main reason cited by the VUPPC leaders is the lack of strong support from the Members of Parliament, including from the ruling party, in the State.

The steel plant was set up in Visakhapatnam after a long struggle in which over 30 people had lost their lives in November 1966. This was followed by the resignation of about 66 MLAs and about 7 MPs from the Left parties. The slogan ‘Visakha Ukku- Andhrula Hakku’ had rocked both the houses of Parliament.

“But that kind of support seems to be missing. The MPs from the ruling YSR Congress Party on the face of it appear to support our agitation, but it is not translating into a strong demand in Parliament. They may have their own political agenda or equations, which is not helping the agitation here,” said J. Ramakrishna of AITUC and member of VUPPC.

“Coming to the MPs from the Left parties, hardly there are about 10 of them in both the Houses combined. They are not being heard properly and their voices are being stifled,” he said.

The VUPPC members had some hopes from the TDP MPs, but even they failed to raise the issue to the desired level. “Probably, even they have some political compulsions in the State and are unable to outrightly go against the BJP-ruled Union Government,” said Ch. Adinarayana, president of AITUC and one of the co-chairmen of VUPPC.

“Only the Prime Minister has the power to rule out the privatisation, but none of the MPs could obtain an appointment with him,” he added.

Sources in VUPPC say that a deal is already in the making and a top Indian company may collaborate with a South Korean steel major to buy the plant at a very nominal price.

Without naming the Indian company, the VUPPC leaders said that though the Indian company has no steel plants so far, it has been allotted iron ore mines and it already has coking coal and boiler coal mines. It also has got ports in its kitty, said Mr. Ramakrishna.

Talking about the way ahead, Ch. Narasinga Rao, State Secretariat Member of CPI (M), and co-chairman of VUPPC, said, “We are aware that the committees are being formed, but so far we did not allow any member of the committee to get inside the plant. Without physical verification the valuation cannot be done. And we have decided to stop them at least till the next General Election in 2024.” This he said probably assuming that the government will change and things can be reverted.

Mr. Adinarayana said that plans are afoot to scale up the agitation to the level of 1966-70 agitation. “We intend to go to the people and the students. It was the students of Andhra Medical College, AVN College and Andhra University, who had then led the agitation from the front,” he said.

He also hopes that the political parties such as TDP, JSP and YSRCP, would also join them before the General and Assembly elections, as 8% of the voters consist of PSU employees and those associated with PSUs, including ancillaries and mining sector.",,[],[]

Export duty levy may force steel companies to review capex plans,"The Centre’s weekend decision to levy a 15% export tax on steel products and iron ore to rein in domestic inflation may force a review of capital-expenditure (capex) plans at local steelmakers that risk being outdone by Chinese and Russian mills globally, industry captains told ET.India's steel exports in 2019-20 totaled 11.2 million tonnes; in 2021-22, shipments rose to 18.4 million tonnes.""This quantity (export) cannot be absorbed in the domestic market as almost all steel producers are affected by the new export duty regime,"" Seshagiri Rao,'s joint managing director, told ET. ""Capacity utilisation will fall, and consequent reviews of further capex plans are inevitable.""To be sure, iron ore now faces a 50% duty and pellets 45%.Steel was the front-runner in reviving private capex locally. Cumulatively, steelmakers have earmarked capex of more than Rs 1 lakh crore in the next two to three years. JSW Steel,and ArcelorMittal/Nippon Steel have announced ambitious plans that would almost double capacities by 2030.They were encouraged by the Indian government to target 300 million tonnes of steelmaking capacity by 2030, from about 100 million tonnes. The supercycle in metals and commodities encouraged them to rapidly slash debt on their balance sheets and simultaneously draw up huge capex in anticipation of steel demand as governments worldwide invest in infrastructure.Top executives at four leading steelmakers said capex would be reviewed as the surplus steel hitherto exported will now find its way into the Indian market.To be sure, the government's move to impose export tariffs will bring some respite to end-user industries such as automotive, consumer electronics and construction, where high steel prices have squeezed corporate margins and hurt consumer demand.Echoing the views of Rao, the managing director of one of India's leading steelmakers said that ""this move to impose export duty is not good for private investment in the steel sector. This sector will expand only as much as domestic demand grows, and India will miss an opportunity to become a strong net exporter of steel.”The imposition of a 15% duty on exports makes it unviable to operate steel plants at full capacity, experts said. The government recognises the pain of high coking coal prices and has removed the duty on coal. Rao and his peers believe it will only have a ""marginal impact"" as coking coal prices are at ""historically elevated levels.""“We invest based on demand and profitability. For export markets, profitability will not be good enough to justify capacity expansion,"" said the executive who did not wish to be named.India was a ‘net importer’ of steel until a few years ago.VR Sharma, managing director of, said that steelmakers export the excess production after meeting domestic demand and steel exports weren’t necessarily at the expense of the domestic manufacturing sector. The increase in steel prices, he said, was due to global reasons, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, that sent energy costs soaring.""We are with the government on controlling inflation. But inflation is not just due to steel,"" Sharma explained.According to Rao, Indian steel prices remained at a discount relative to international prices for the past few years, enabling downstream industries to become competitive. India's engineering competitiveness was reflected by a jump in engineering goods exports from $75 billion in FY20 to $112 billion in FY22.Meanwhile, the Indian steel industry's capacity utilisation improved to 87% in March 2022 as exports totalling 15% of total output led to higher capacity utilisation, employment creation, and foreign exchange earnings for the country. When the international steel prices started falling, domestic prices fell in line with landed costs in India.""The domestic downstream industry has never been at a disadvantage either in availability or price,"" said Rao.On Saturday, the Finance Ministry imposed a 45% export duty on iron ore pellets from nil duty earlier and a flat 15% duty on export of flat steel products from zero duty earlier.One of the executives quoted above said that the move was counter-intuitive to the government’s stance on “Make in India” and boosting exports. Indian steelmakers are part of a global supply chain and their relationship with their customers is in jeopardy now. Overseas customers developed over the years will look for cheaper sources of steel, they said.“Painstaking work of so many years will go for a toss,” this executive said, requesting not to be named.",,[],"['Nehal Chaliawala', 'Satish John']"

Nextracker announces second dedicated steel line for tracker components,"Tracker manufacturer, Nextracker, announced a new manufacturing line dedicated to producing steel tracker components for use in utility-scale solar power plants at Atkore’ Phoenix, Arizona facility, which has been expanded and reconfigured with new capacity dedicated to Nextracker products.

According to Nextracker, the move was made in part to ensure that the company has a dedicated supply of critical materials in the strategic solar market of the Southwestern United States and is well-positioned to support key customers in the region, with the company highlighting Arizona utility, Arizona Public Service (APS), as one such key customer.

“Building out our manufacturing capacity with partners across the US allows us to protect customers from cost volatility, steel supply risk and delays in logistics,” said Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker. “Partnering with Atkore in Phoenix provides product in the epicenter of the Southwest’s rapidly growing region from a population and power perspective and ensures that best in class product is available to enable that demand to be served with clean, affordable solar power.”

Nextracker already has plans for the first components created in the Atkore facility. According to the company, newly-manufactured components will be used in the construction of APS’ 150 MW Agave solar project. That project will be Arizona to its core, featuring First Solar modules and being constructed by Arizona-based McCarthy Building Companies.

Securing steel

Today’s announcement marks the second steel manufacturer to add a dedicated Nextracker production line in as many months. In April, Nextracker and JM Steel, a division of JENNMAR USA, announced a partnership under which a dedicated solar tracker production line was built on the campus of a new Steel Dynamics manufacturing facility near Corpus Christi, Texas.

The Steel Dynamics facility utilizes electric arc furnaces in its manufacturing, which have been described as a “next-generation” process for steel fabrication, one which can lead to electric arc furnace facilities being up to 75% less carbon-intensive than traditional blast furnaces. As for the new Atkore manufacturing line, it has not yet been shared whether or not the company will look to institute low-carbon fabrication practices.

Securing steel fabrication to alleviate supply chain concerns and shipping volatility is an emerging trend in the tracker and racking space, one that could hold momentum if the aforementioned market concerns persist. Another prominent name in the space, Terrasmart fabricates its own steel structures in house. In a prior interview with pv magazine, Terrasmart President, Ed McKiernan said that such an approach allows his company to switch up their operations “on a dime,” and to accommodate design and timeline changes for customers.

One issue that Terrasmart has run into, however, is sourcing the steel to enable this process, as steel supply markets have had historically high demand, and can be difficult to navigate as a somewhat-newer entrant. In partnering with an existing name in the industry, Nextracker should be able to forgo some of these sourcing concerns, while still keeping overall costs down and product innovation flexible.",,[],"['Tim Sylvia', 'Tim Sylvia Is An Associate Editor At Pv Magazine Usa.', 'A Recent Graduate Of Hood College', 'Tim Has Been With Pv Magazine Since May']"

Metal industry blames govt for recent coal crisis,"Rakesh Kumar By

Express News Service

NEW DELHI: The ongoing coal shortage in the country is not just impacting the thermal power plants but other sectors such as steel and aluminum too. According to industry sources, the dip in coal production over the last few years has led the country’s GDP to decline by almost 1% and has caused millions of jobs losses. “Though the global factors have added to the recent crisis, the government is also responsible for the shortage of coal in the country,” said a top official from the steel industry.

The metal industry has questioned the monopoly of Coal India Limited (CIL), which supplies 80% of India’s coal needs. They claim that the demand for coal in India is nearly a billion tonnes a year, and the supply is below 800 million tonnes. Therefore, the industry is of the view that India will import around 300 million tonnes of coal this year because of the shortage. In the pre-covid era India was importing around 220 million tonnes of coal.

“Consider the CIL performance in the last few years: Its output was 606 MT in 2018-2019, 602 MT in 2019-2020, and 596 MT in 2020-2021. Contrast this with various governments’ efforts to ramp up Coal production in the 1992-2010,” said the official. India is facing a power crisis due to coal shortage at its thermal power plants. The coal shortage has raised a lot of concern amongst various stakeholders including government bodies, thermal power plants, metal and mining industry industries and investors.

However, the government claims there is no shortage of coal as such and said it had raised coal production in the country. According to the coal ministry, the current total coal production increased by 29% to 66.58 Million Ton (MT) from 51.62 MT in April 2022 as compared to April, 2021.

“Of course, there is a shortage of coal in the country; otherwise the government would not have taken so many steps. They have mandated all imported coal-based plant to operate and generate power to their full capacity. Also, directed gencos based on domestic coal will have to import at least 10% of their fuel requirement. These things showcase the country is facing an immense coal crisis,” said Shailendra Dubey, chairman of All India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF).

The industries, which are dependent on coal, also alleged that the government is diverting coal meant for industry to the power sectors. “The power sector is the priority, the steel sector is not the priority,” said an official from the steel industry.",,[],[]

When an Indie Watch Brand Teams With a Street-Culture Brand,"How does being an independent brand versus a group brand help?

We can do things that bigger group-owned brands can’t with their marketing and message. Our latest watch released this year is the Streamliner Chronograph Blacker Than Black, with a case coated in Vantablack material [a process said to absorb most visible light]. The message was about showing a glimpse of the future of our industry. When you go to an exhibition, sure, you want to see the new pieces from the brands, but you also want to see something different, to discover the concept watches. Or, as in car shows, you want to discover the Ferrari of the future, or the BMW concept car with all the gadgets you would never see in a production car. This attracts the people and then we can engage them in what else we have to offer.

Who is your target market?

Our prices start at around $13,000 so a younger collector who wants to buy an indie brand can do it. The age of our average customer today versus 10 years ago has dropped by 20 to 30 years, even though we have watches retailing for as much as $90,000. It sounds a bit extreme, but we see our brand talking to the Millennial and Gen X and Gen Y customers.

We produce just about 2,000 watches a year, so we often have waiting lists. What makes them so in demand has a lot to do with our minimalistic design aesthetic, and our bold fumé gradient dials in multiple tones like Funky Blue and Matrix Green. At $40,000 for the average sale, consumers must like what we are doing.",,[],['Roberta Naas']

What Happened on Day 85 of the War in Ukraine,"A cat near the body of a Russian soldier seen Thursday outside a school destroyed by bombardment in the village of Vilkhivka, which had been occupied for weeks by Russian forces, near Kharkiv, Ukraine.

KRAKOW, Poland — Fresh from its triumph over the last armed Ukrainian resistance in the devastated city of Mariupol, Russia appeared to be laying the groundwork Thursday for annexing swaths of southeast Ukraine, described by a high-ranking Kremlin official as having a “worthy place in our Russian family.’’

The official, Marat Khusnullin, Russia’s deputy prime minister for infrastructure, toured the region this week and outlined plans to take full control of vital infrastructure, including Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, as Russia fortified its defensive positions there and exerted its authority over the local population.

“I came here to provide maximum opportunities for integration,” Mr. Khusnullin was quoted by Russian news media as saying.

In a further sign that Moscow was preparing to push for the Russification of the region — the way it has in Crimea since seizing it from Ukraine in 2014 — Russian officials have already moved to introduce the ruble currency, install proxy politicians in local governments, impose new school curriculums, reroute internet servers through Russia and cut the population off from Ukrainian broadcasts.

Mr. Khusnullin said Russia even intended to charge Ukraine for electricity generated by the Ukrainian nuclear plant that Russian forces commandeered in the early weeks of the invasion — a plan that Ukraine described as extortion.

Russia’s moves came as the United States sought to further escalate pressure on the Kremlin. President Biden vowed to help gain speedy approval of applications to join NATO by formerly neutral Finland and Sweden, as he welcomed the leaders of those countries to the White House and as U.S. officials expressed confidence that they could satisfy Turkey’s objections to Finnish and Swedish membership. And the Senate overwhelmingly approved a $40 billion aid package for Ukraine that Mr. Biden was set to sign into law.

Even as the Russian authorities projected control over a Ukrainian region that is culturally close to Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin appeared to be punishing military subordinates for blunders in the three-month-old invasion.

A report by Britain’s defense intelligence agency suggested the Kremlin was conducting a purge of senior commanders deemed responsible for the failures of Russia’s initial strategy to seize much more Ukraine territory, including the capital, Kyiv, and second-largest city, Kharkiv. The report raised the question of whether Mr. Putin retained faith in his chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov.

The Russians have said nothing about any changes in the military leadership.

Russia’s new, narrower strategy of focusing on Ukraine’s east has proved more successful than its initially greater aims, even as its forces have retreated in the northeast and struggled to gain ground in the eastern Donbas region.

Following the longest battle of the war, Russian soldiers completed their capture of Mariupol on Tuesday after having seized control of the sprawling Azovstal steel plant, the last redoubt of Ukrainian defenders. More than 700 fighters from the Azov battalion, die-hards who had made a final stand against the Russians from the plant, surrendered between Wednesday and Thursday, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, bringing the total number of captives to 1,730.

The Kremlin has been using the mass surrender for propaganda purposes, describing its captives as terrorists and Nazi war criminals, and framing the conquest of Mariupol as a turning point in the conflict.

Although much of Mariupol is ruined, the capture of the port city is expected to bring Russia concrete benefits. It will complete a long-sought land bridge between the Russian-controlled Crimean peninsula to the south and the adjoining region known as Donbas, where pro-Russian separatists have battled Ukrainian forces since the Crimea annexation.

With Mariupol captured, Russian troops are now freed to help entrench Russia’s authority over the rest of the eastern region — well short of Moscow’s initial push to control all of Ukraine, but strong leverage in any future peace negotiations.

The fighting has settled into a stalemate along most of the front.

Stiff Ukrainian resistance is forcing Russian troops to fight in smaller formations and seek more limited objectives elsewhere in the Donbas region, a senior Pentagon official said on Thursday.

“They’re going after smaller objectives,” the senior official said of the Russian goals, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details of American defense intelligence work. “And sometimes those objectives are only maintained for a short period of time before the Ukrainians take them back. They’re just being more modest in what they’re trying to go after.”

The shift in Russian tactics reflects not only the resilient Ukrainian defense, but also the nagging command, logistics and morale problems that continued to bedevil Russian commanders, especially in the hotly contested Donbas, the official said.

The southern region under Russian control covers a vast expanse that includes Ukraine’s agricultural heartland and several key ports. Along with Russia’s naval dominion in the Black Sea, annexation would tighten Moscow’s stranglehold on the Ukrainian economy and solidify its blockade of Ukraine’s southern coast.

In another possible sign of steps to entrench Russia’s control, its troops closed checkpoints on Thursday for civilians crossing between Russian-occupied zones and Ukrainian controlled areas in two regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, according to the Ukrainian military and local authorities.

At one checkpoint, near the town of Vasilyevka, a line of cars transporting mostly women and children seeking to evacuate Russian-held areas stretched through farm fields. Ukrainian officials estimated more than 1,000 cars waited at the crossing, said Zlata Nekrasova, the deputy governor of the Ukrainian regional government in Zaporizhzhia.

The Ukrainians have accused Russia of forcibly deporting thousands to Russia and witnesses have described increasingly repressive efforts to enforce Russian rule.

The Kremlin has sought to portray its actions as reflecting popular will. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, appeared to play down the significance of Mr. Khusnullin’s statements signaling annexation, saying only locals could decide.

But in a move that some analysts regarded as reflecting confusion within the Russian leadership about how to secure Ukrainian areas seized by Russia, a group of lawmakers on Thursday submitted a bill to the State Duma that would allow Mr. Putin to establish “temporary administrations on territories where Russia’s army conducts military operations.”

Mr. Khusnullin said that Russia would soon begin charging Ukraine for electricity from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which Russia has controlled since early March. When fully operational, the plant can produce enough energy for four million homes.

Ukraine’s energy provider, NPC Ukrenergo, which called Mr. Khusnullin’s statement nuclear blackmail, said the real aim was to give Russia electricity leverage over Ukraine and the rest of Europe. It noted that the plant was part of the Ukrainian power grid and unequipped to deliver power to Russia.

Moscow’s announcements were also part of a propaganda campaign aimed at conveying control over areas where its grip is less solid. Military analysts have said Russia’s forces could still face Ukrainian uprisings and counteroffensives.

Russia’s invasion in February, spearheaded by a rapid advance of tanks and helicopters, ultimately led to many Russian casualties, including some senior generals on the battlefield. The finger-pointing has started, Britain’s defense intelligence agency said in its Thursday report.

It said the commander of the elite 1st Guards Tank Army, Lt. Gen. Serhiy Kisel, had been suspended for failure to capture Kharkiv, where Ukrainian forces have not only counterattacked but driven the invaders back toward the Russian border 40 miles away.

The British agency also reported that the commander of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, Vice Adm. Igor Osipov, had likely been suspended following the April sinking of the fleet’s flagship, the cruiser Moskva. Asked about the report, a senior Pentagon went further, saying the commander had been dismissed.

General Gerasimov, Russia’s highest ranking uniformed officer, “likely remains in post but it is unclear whether he retains the confidence” of Mr. Putin, the British report said.

But in a signal that General Gerasimov remained in good standing, he spoke on Thursday by phone with Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon said. It was their first call since the invasion.

In the port city of Kherson, in the south near the border with Crimea, Mr. Khusnullin inspected infrastructure, including the port, a cargo railway station and a factory.

“We will live and work together,” he said, adding that Russia had already allocated funds to restore the city’s roads.

“We will now eat tomatoes and tomato paste more often in Russia thanks to the work of Kherson’s agricultural producers,” Mr. Khusnullin said, alluding to Kherson’s longtime role as a breadbasket and a global exporter.

But even as he spoke, Ukrainian officials said a convoy of civilian cars trying to flee the region came under fire from Russian soldiers. Roughly half of the million people who once lived in the region have fled, with witnesses who escaped offering harrowing stories of Russian repression.

In Kyiv, a committee in Ukraine’s Parliament accused Russia of having robbed Kherson of 400,000 tons of grain, sending it to Russia and creating conditions that “may lead to famine in the occupied territories.”

A Russian naval blockade of Ukraine’s ports is preventing Ukraine from exporting millions more tons, putting tens of millions of people worldwide at risk of hunger and famine, the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said Thursday at a U.N. conference on food security.

"India’s Green Future, Built On Hydrogen","The latest buzzword in the world of global energy aspirations sounds like the title of a blockbuster Sci-Fi movie — Green H2 -1-1-1 ($1 for 1 kg of green hydrogen in 1 decade). The buzzword may be new but the science behind it was dreamt up way back in the 19th century. “Water will one day be employed as fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of an intensity of which coal is not capable,” Jules Verne wrote in his 1875 novel, The Mysterious Island.

Hydrogen, nature’s lightest and most abundant element, can be used as energy after being taken out from coal (brown hydrogen), natural gas (grey hydrogen), renewable energy (green hydrogen) and water (blue hydrogen). Technologies for doing so have been around for decades but are yet to become commercially viable as output is less than the energy used to produce the gas. But this is set to change with governments and companies making hydrogen an important part of their carbon neutrality goals.

The ball was set rolling by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he unveiled the 25-year roadmap for hydrogen development in his address on India’s 75th Independence Day and announced the National Hydrogen Mission to meet the larger goal of self-reliance in energy production by the 100th Independence Day in 2047. “The thing that is going to help India with a quantum leap in terms of climate is green hydrogen. We have to make India a global hub for green hydrogen production and export,” he said.

Some years ago, government had launched a similar mission for solar power under which India is chasing 500 gigawatt (GW) capacity by 2030 and has achieved much success —100 GW, from less than 30 GW six years ago. Will hydrogen see a similar takeoff? It will, but with time. “Hydrogen will drive economies not now but in near future. Today’s electrolysers (used to separate hydrogen from water using cathode, anode and membrane) consume 40-50 units of electricity to split water and generate 30-35 units. Energy consumed is more than energy produced,” says M.V.S Seshagiri Rao, joint MD & group CFO of JSW Group.

Why Hydrogen?

For energy-starved India, which is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2070, the path to energy security goes through a mix of oil, coal, blended fuels, natural gas, renewables and electricity. At present India’s $3.12 trillion economy needs 1,650 billion units (BU) of power, made from nearly 400 GW of capacity. Of this, green electricity is only 17%. When the economy touches $5-7 trillion in the next decade, it will need at least 3,000-4,000 GW. Further, at current rate, the energy import bill will triple by 2040. The only way out of these massive challenges is tapping as many green and locally available energy sources as possible.

New Delhi-based climate and energy research firm, Council for Energy, Environment and Water Research (CEEWR) has estimated that net zero emissions by 2070 will require 5,630 GW solar capacity, 99% reduction in coal use between 2040 and 2060 and 90% fall in crude oil consumption between 2050 and 2070. By that time, green hydrogen should meet 19% of industry’s needs, it says. CEEWR’s Centre for Energy Finance says India requires $10 trillion (₹750 lakh crore) energy investments, including $8.4 trillion for augmenting renewable capabilities. Another $1.5 trillion will be required for creating a green hydrogen ecosystem in the industrial sector, it says.

The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) estimates 23 MT hydrogen demand by 2050. India’s current output is 6.7 MT, produced mostly from natural gas through steam-methane reforming process (methane reacts with steam under pressure in presence of a catalyst to produce hydrogen, carbon monoxide and a small amount of carbon dioxide). The biggest consumers of this hydrogen are refineries, chemical companies and fertiliser plants.",,[],['P B Jayakumar']
Bsl Tops Sail’s Profit Charts In 2021-22 Fy,"BOKARO: Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL) has clocked its highest ever profit of around Rs 6,387cr, a statement said.

The 2020-21 and 2021-22 financial years were unstable due to Covid-19 pandemic, but some industries performed remarkably well,” read the statement.BSL also created a history achieving highest ever profit and registered an increase in exports. BSL’s chief of communication Manikant Dhan said, “Apart from making significant achievements in production, BSL exported about 2,65,437 tonnes of steel to Bangladesh, Nepal, Middle East, Singapore, among others. This also includes export of steel in the European markets.”SAIL too made remarkable improvement in financial performance due to robust operational performance. SAIL supplied steel for various projects of national importance like Central Vista Delhi, Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail, Delhi-Meerut RRTS, Polavaram irrigation project, Kaleshwaram Irrigation Project Purvanchal Expressway , several metro rail projects. It also supplied Liquid Medical Oxygen in excess of 1.3 lakh tonne, majorly during the second wave of Covid-19.",,[],[]

The War in Ukraine Is Speeding Europe’s Pivot to Renewables,"Placeholder while article actions load

Europe aims to lead the global fight against climate change by rapidly shifting away from fossil fuels. Yet in the wake of the pandemic, the continent was rocked by disruptions in its energy supply that caused prices to surge -– even before the turmoil triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now the forces have combined to put Europe’s so-called energy transition onto something of a wartime footing, testing the limits of an accelerated timeline to adopt new technologies and leaving consumers footing higher bills.

1. How fast is Europe changing?

A decades-long push into wind and solar energy has transformed countries such as Denmark and Germany into leaders in the technologies. The 27 countries in the European Union got about a fifth of their total energy from renewables in 2020 and had planned to double that share to 40% by 2030. In the wake of the war in Ukraine, the target was raised to 45%. Germany, which relied on Russia for the bulk of its oil, natural gas and coal, brought forward its goal of 100% renewable power by more than a decade to 2035. That’s a very ambitious challenge since wind and solar farms take years to plan and build. If anything, the crisis has made EU policymakers more committed to the bloc’s so-called Green Deal, the flagship climate policy that includes a massive package of laws to meet a target of zeroing-out greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.

2. What disrupted Europe’s energy supply?

In 2021, Europe’s vulnerability was laid bare by an unexpected chain of events: A stronger-than-expected post-pandemic recovery (which created higher demand for energy) coincided with weather patterns that created unusually low wind speeds, at a time when natural gas was in short supply because of an unusually cold and long winter. As a result, electricity prices more than tripled from August to December. Then in February, Russia’s military campaign triggered rounds of financial sanctions against Moscow. President Vladimir Putin hit back by weaponizing natural gas flows to his neighbors. In late April, he escalated threats and shut off natural gas flowing to Poland and Bulgaria, though these are two countries where the impact was small.

3. Why is Russia such a big factor?

Russia is the world’s biggest exporter of gas and Europe is its biggest customer. As coal and nuclear plants around the bloc were shuttered in recent years, some countries became more dependent on the giant pipelines carrying gas from Siberia. For many years, EU officials talked about the need to wean off of Russian supplies, but since both sides benefited, and gas delivered by pipeline was often cheaper (and cleaner) than other energy sources, little action was taken. The EU relied on gas for about a quarter of its energy, with Russia accounting for more than a third of that supply in 2021, up from 26% in 2001. When the conflict in Ukraine erupted, it was suddenly untenable for Europe to continue spending as much as $1 billion a day on coal, gas and oil imported from Russia -– since it was funding the war machine.

4. How did Europe respond?

Europe’s plans suddenly got a lot more urgent. First Nord Stream 2, a second gas link from Russia to Germany that had become entangled in a political battle, was put firmly on hold. As the U.S. and other allies went ahead with an embargo of Russian energy, EU policymakers rushed to find alternative supplies. They hashed out a tiered retreat that began with a ban on Russian coal from August. Then they wrestled for weeks to try to develop a plan to phase out Russian oil this year and reduce imports of gas by two-thirds. It’s difficult as some refineries and chemical plants in the eastern part of the bloc are captive customers, as they get their feedstocks via pipelines from Russia.

5. What’s the fallout?

Europe’s manufacturers took a hit because energy prices rose faster than in other regions. Some of the continent’s biggest fertilizer makers, steel producers and aluminum smelters cut production because power and gas prices at least four times higher than historical norms made them uncompetitive on world markets. German officials asked citizens to curb energy use and warned about possible rationing of natural gas, rattling companies from car manufacturers to cement makers. As the war dragged on for months, more economists predicted the energy crisis would cause Europe’s economy to shrink, tipping it into a recession.

6. How did Europe keep the lights on?

Initially at least, there was a return to dirtier fuels. The use of hard coal and lignite to generate power in the EU rose 12% in the first quarter of 2022 from a year earlier as decommissioned plants were reconsidered. Longer-term, there are no easy tradeoffs for an energy mix that also includes about 35% oil, 12% coal and 13% nuclear. A push to bring in more liquefied natural gas by ship, which costs about four times more than Russian pipeline gas, was constrained by infrastructure and limited global supplies. There was talk of delaying the phase-out nuclear power in Germany and other countries -– a source of stable electricity virtually free of emissions -– but only Belgium extended the life of two reactors. At the same time, France’s aging nuclear plants, still the backbone of the region’s integrated power system, are becoming more unreliable. Output from the fleet may fall to the lowest in more than three decades this year.

7. How fast can it shift?

That’s not clear. Some member states, including Poland, questioned the ambitious shift to renewables in light of the war and record energy prices. But EU leaders have stuck with the Green Deal, pushing renewables and energy efficiency as the best long-term solution. What’s more, higher prices mean more of the burden is falling on consumers. It’s driving the fastest inflation in decades, pushing what’s known as the “the cost-of-living crisis” to the top of the political agenda. By the end of 2021, there was a slew of measures to help the poorest: France dished out “energy checks,” Italy limited price increases and Sweden offered rebates based on energy consumption. But these are likely temporary measures. The rupture with Russia means Europe will likely face higher energy costs for the foreseeable future. Overall, subsidies for renewables are being phased out, which means that energy prices will need to be high enough to cover the cost of green investments.

The Race to Produce Green Steel,"In the city of Woburn, Massachusetts, a suburb just north of Boston, a cadre of engineers and scientists in white coats inspected an orderly stack of brick-sized, gunmetal-gray steel ingots on a desk inside a neon-illuminated lab space.

What they were looking at was a batch of steel created using an innovative manufacturing method, one that Boston Metal, a company that spun out a decade ago from MIT, hopes will dramatically reshape the way the alloy has been made for centuries. By using electricity to separate iron from its ore, the firm claims it can make steel without releasing carbon dioxide, offering a path to cleaning up one of the world’s worst industries for greenhouse gas emissions.

An essential input for engineering and construction, steel is one of the most popular industrial materials in the world, with more than 2 billion tons produced annually. This abundance, however, comes at a steep price for the environment. Steelmaking accounts for 7 to 11 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions, making it one of the largest industrial sources of atmospheric pollution. And because production could rise by a third by 2050, this environmental burden could grow.

Related One Last Climate Warning

That poses a significant challenge for tackling the climate crisis. The United Nations says significantly cutting industrial carbon emissions is essential to keeping global warming under the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark set under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. To do so, emissions from steel and other heavy industries will have to fall by 93 percent by 2050, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency.

Facing escalating pressure from governments and investors to reduce emissions, a number of steelmakers — including both major producers and startups — are experimenting with low-carbon technologies that use hydrogen or electricity instead of traditional carbon-intensive manufacturing. Some of these efforts are nearing commercial reality.

“What we are talking about is a capital-intensive, risk-averse industry where disruption is extremely rare,” said Chris Bataille, an energy economist at IDDRI, a Paris-based research think tank. Therefore, he added, “it’s exciting” that there’s so much going on all at once.

Still, experts agree that transforming a global industry that turned over $2.5 trillion in 2017 and employs more than 6 million people will take enormous effort. Beyond the practical obstacles to scaling up novel processes in time to reach global climate goals, there are concerns about China, where over half the world’s steel is made and whose plans to decarbonize the steel sector remain vague.

“It’s certainly not an easy fix to decarbonize an industry like this,” said Bataille. “But there’s no choice. The future of the sector — and that of our climate — depends on just that.”

Modern steelmaking involves several production stages. Most commonly, iron ore is crushed and turned into sinter (a rough solid) or pellets. Separately, coal is baked and converted into coke. The ore and coke are then mixed with limestone and fed into a large blast furnace where a flow of extremely hot air is introduced from the bottom. Under high temperatures, the coke burns and the mixture produces liquid iron, known as pig iron or blast-furnace iron. The molten material then goes into an oxygen furnace, where it’s blasted with pure oxygen through a water-cooled lance, which forces off carbon to leave crude steel as a final product.

This method, first patented by English engineer Henry Bessemer in the 1850s, produces carbon-dioxide emissions in different ways. First, the chemical reactions in the blast furnace result in emissions, as carbon trapped in coke and limestone binds with oxygen in the air to create carbon dioxide as a byproduct. In addition, fossil fuels are typically burned to heat the blast furnace and to power sintering and pelletizing plants, as well as coke ovens, emitting carbon dioxide in the process.

As much as 70 percent of the world’s steel is produced this way, generating nearly two tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of steel produced. The remaining 30 percent is almost all made through electric arc furnaces, which use an electrical current to melt steel — largely recycled scrap — and have far lower CO2 emissions than blast furnaces.

“It’s certainly not an easy fix to decarbonize an industry like this,” said Bataille. “But there’s no choice. The future of the sector — and that of our climate — depends on just that.”

But because of the limited scrap supply, not all future demand can be met this way, said Jeffrey Rissman, an industry program director and head of modeling at the San Francisco-based energy and climate policy firm Energy Innovation. With the right policies in place, recycling could supply up to 45 percent of global demand in 2050, he said. “The rest will be satisfied by forging primary ore-based steel, which is where most emissions come from.”

So “if the steel industry is serious” about its climate commitments, he added, “it will have to fundamentally reshape the way the material is made — and do so fairly quickly.”

One alternative technology being tested replaces coke with hydrogen. In Sweden, Hybrit — a joint venture between the steelmaker SSAB, the energy supplier Vattenfall, and LKAB, an iron ore producer — is piloting a process that aims to repurpose an existing system called direct reduced iron. The process uses coke from fossil fuels to extract oxygen from iron ore pellets, leaving a porous iron pellet called sponge iron.

The Hybrit method instead extracts the oxygen using fossil-free hydrogen gas. The gas is created through electrolysis, a technique that uses an electric current — in this case, from a fossil-free energy source — to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen. (Most pure hydrogen today is made with methane, which produces CO2 when burned.) The resulting sponge iron then goes into an electric arc furnace, where it’s eventually refined into steel. The process releases only water vapor as a byproduct.

“This technology has been known for a while, but it’s only been done in the lab so far,” said Mikael Nordlander, head of industry decarbonization at Vattenfall. “What we are doing here is to see if it can work at [the] industrial level.”

Last August, Hybrit reached its first milepost: SSAB, which produces and sells the end product, delivered its first batch of fossil-free steel to the automaker Volvo, which used it in vehicle prototypes. It is also planning a plant for commercial-scale production, which it aims to complete by 2026.

Another Swedish venture, H2 Green Steel, is developing a similar commercial-scale hydrogen steel plant with the help of $105 million raised from private investors and companies including Mercedes-Benz, Scania, and IMAS Foundation, an organization linked to Ikea. The company plans to begin production by 2024 and produce 5 million tons of zero-emissions steel annually by the end of the decade. Other companies testing hydrogen-powered steelmaking include ArcelorMittal, Thyssenkrupp, and Salzgitter AG in Germany; Posco in South Korea; and Voestalpine in Austria.

Electricity can also be used to reduce iron ore. Boston Metal, for example, has developed a process called molten oxide electrolysis, in which a current moves through a cell containing iron ore. As electricity travels between both ends of the cell and heats up the ore, oxygen bubbles up (and can be collected), while iron ore is reduced into liquid iron that pools at the bottom of the cell and is periodically tapped. The purified iron is then mixed with carbon and other ingredients.

“What we do is basically swapping carbon for electricity as a reducing agent,” explained Adam Rauwerdink, the company’s senior vice president of business development. “This allows us to make very high-quality steel using way less energy and in fewer steps than conventional steelmaking.” As long as power comes from fossil-free sources, he added, the process generates no carbon emissions.

He said the company, which currently runs three pilot lines at its Woburn facility, is working to bring its laboratory concept to the market, using $50 million raised last year from an investor group including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, backed by Bill Gates, and the German carmaker BMW. A commercial-scale demonstration plant is expected to be up and running by 2025.

“I feel all these solutions have their place, depending on location, resource availability, and targeted product,” said Sridhar Seetharaman, a professor of materials science and engineering at Arizona State University. “However I do not think for now any one alone will give you a silver bullet to meet the demand.”

“Hydrogen has a bit of a head start being based on an established system and it’s also ahead in commercialization,” said Bataille, the IDDRI energy economist. “But achieving a net-zero steel industry will take more carbon-free pathways, so I think there will be enough room in the market for all of them in the end.”

Although greener steelmaking processes appear to be gaining momentum, there remain a number of serious challenges to confront. Chief among them is the massive expansion in renewable energy infrastructure that an industry-wide shift to these new methods would entail, said Thomas Koch Blank, senior principal at the Colorado-based nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute. He estimates that the world would need up to three times the currently installed solar and wind energy sources to electrify the existing primary steel production.

Another barrier is cost. Switching to electricity or hydrogen would require vast amounts of capital spending to erect new plants and retrofit old ones. In the case of the clean hydrogen method, the price tag for steel will increase largely because steel producers are located close to low-cost coking coal rather than low-cost hydrogen, pointed out Koch Blank. “These upfront costs will likely drive up the price of both steel and the end products, at least in the beginning.”

According to Rissman, the analyst in San Francisco, legislation on both the supply and the demand side could help offset those higher costs and encourage more investment in greener technologies. Governments, he said, could incentivize the use of low-carbon steel for building and infrastructure by requiring state-funded projects to use low-carbon versions of designated construction materials. They could also enforce policies that make it more expensive to buy from countries where rules on emissions are less stringent. That will help domestic producers “stay competitive” as the market for clean steel “grows and new production processes achieve economies of scale,” said Rissman.

“It’s a fantastic challenge that we’re up against,” Rauwerdink said. But, he added, “We are showing that solutions exist — and work.”

Perhaps the biggest roadblock is China, where about 90 percent of steel production is achieved using blast furnaces. In September 2020, President Xi Jinping announced that the country aims to become carbon neutral by 2060. In a bid to reduce pollution from domestic steel mills, which account for roughly 15 percent of the nation’s overall carbon emissions, Beijing has also pledged to achieve peak steel emissions by 2030. Even so, 18 new blast-furnace projects were announced in China just in the first six months of 2021, according to the Helsinki-based research group Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

Steel is one of the most important and challenging industries to decarbonize, said Rissman, so global coordination on it would help greatly.

Back in Boston, Rauwerdink, surveying Boston Metal’s factory lines, agreed. “It’s a fantastic challenge that we’re up against,” he said. But, he added, “We are showing that solutions exist — and work.”

"This Colorado steel mill 'built the American west,' but its ownership has ties to Russia","(CNN) The steel mill that looms over low-slung neighborhoods in Pueblo, Colorado, is a rare bright spot for American manufacturing. Once part of the state's largest private employer, pumping out steel that was used to build rail lines across the Western US, it is now in the midst of a major expansion and recently became the world's first steel plant to run almost entirely on solar power.

But in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, the steelworkers and their city are grappling with an unpleasant reality that is no longer easy to ignore: The mill is owned by a company that has been accused of potentially supplying steel to build Russian tanks and whose largest stakeholder is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The plant, which still ranks among the largest employers in the small city of Pueblo, was bought in 2007 by Evraz, one of Russia's major steel-producing companies. Evraz's biggest shareholder is the oligarch Roman Abramovich, who was sanctioned by the United Kingdom, the European Union and Canada last month.

In announcing its sanctions , the UK government alleged that Abramovich controlled Evraz and that the company was ""potentially supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks."" Abramovich was involved in ""destabilising Ukraine"" through Evraz, the sanctions office wrote.

Evraz, which owns several other steel plants in Oregon and Canada in addition to the Pueblo mill, has denied that it supplies the Russian military and tried to distance itself from Abramovich. But its stock fell by 90% from the beginning of the year before it was suspended from the London Stock Exchange in the wake of the invasion, and its entire board of directors quit . The company nearly defaulted on its debt last month due to a sanctions-related delay in a bond payment.

Evraz's North American subsidiary and its employees say the steel produced in the US is not going to Russia. The North American operation doesn't send money to the parent company, and its profits are reinvested in its US and Canadian operations, according to executives.

But in recent years, the parent company's operations have resulted in billions of dollars in dividends that have largely gone to Abramovich and a handful of other Russian oligarchs. Advocates for Ukraine say they're distressed that the US hasn't followed its allies in sanctioning Abramovich, and that a figure with close ties to Putin still holds the largest stake in the company that owns the Pueblo mill.

""There is no clean money among the oligarchs,"" said Marina Dubrova, the founder of Ukrainians of Colorado, a non-profit organization that has raised funds to send medical supplies to Ukraine. Even if he were to own a ""half percent, even one-tenth of a percent"" in the company, she argued, ""Abramovich has to be sanctioned and his portion has to go to the highest bidder.""

So far, executives and local employees at the Pueblo plant say there has been no impact on their day-to-day job. But some workers are worried about whether that could change if more sanctions go into effect.

""Just the uncertainty is scary, it's real scary,"" said Rique Lucero, a metallurgical technician who has worked at the plant for 14 years. ""We wonder how the war is going to further affect us.""

The Evraz situation is an example of how Russian investment in the West could be complicating sanctions: The company employs more than 1,600 people in the US, and the need to avoid job losses could make officials more cautious about sanctioning Abramovich, sanctions experts said.

And the company also shows that the Russian elite's money in the US goes deeper than stereotypical luxury items -- even reaching a historic icon of American industry.

Most people think Russian ""oligarchs have been putting their money primarily into these mega-mansions, these superyachts, high-end artwork, Ferraris, Maseratis,"" said Casey Michel, the author of a book on foreign investment in the US. But in addition to those flashy status symbols, he said, ""there are so many other significant industries that are wide-open for all this oligarchic money.""

A plant that 'built the American West'

A worker mans the control room at the Evraz steel mill in Pueblo.

Every hour, tons of recycled scrap metal are dropped into the Pueblo mill's massive furnace, with a deafening boom and an eruption of golden sparks. The metal is heated at about 3000 degrees Fahrenheit into white-hot, molten steel, then cooled and carefully rolled into rail, wire rod, rebar or pipe.

That transformation has been taking place here, in one form or another, since the mill was founded in 1881 as the first steel plant west of the Mississippi River.

Owned by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company, which grew into Colorado's largest private employer, the mill attracted workers from around the world. At one point, 40 languages were spoken at the mill and its mines. It pumped out rail that stretched around the region, speeding migration across the sparsely settled Western US.

""This steel really built the American West,"" said Nick Gradisar, Pueblo's mayor, whose father and grandfather worked at the mill, and who worked there himself several summers during college. ""It used to be that the fortunes of Pueblo rose and fell on the economics of the steel industry.""

The city experienced the downside of that relationship when the price of steel crashed in the 1980s. Thousands of workers at the plant lost their jobs over several years, local leaders say.

Historical photos of a mining operation are displayed at the Evraz offices in Pueblo.

After the downturn, the mill went through bankruptcy and was bought by an Oregon-based company. Evraz bought the parent company in 2007 for $2.3 billion, in what was at the time the largest ever Russian investment in the US.

According to the company's 2021 annual report , five percent of Evraz employees are in North America and about 16% of its revenue comes from its North American steel operation. Most of its other mills are in Russia and Kazakhstan.

As of February, Abramovich, a globe-trotting owner of the Chelsea soccer team who holds citizenship in at least two other countries, owned the largest stake in Evraz, at roughly 29%, according to the company . But the UK sanctions office argued that he effectively controls the company, which is publicly traded, along with his associates: Four other Russian oligarchs control another 38% of the company.

Evraz has been a lucrative investment for Abramovich and other oligarchs. In 2021, according to its annual report, almost half of Evraz's profit went to paying out more than $1.5 billion in dividends to its shareholders -- two-thirds of which went to the five largest Russian shareholders. Evraz's financial performance in 2021 ""made it possible to pay"" such generous dividends, the company wrote in the annual report, citing numbers that included a big increase in earnings in its North American operations.

Abramovich also has myriad investments in the US hidden through complicated networks of shell corporations and hedge funds, The New York Times reported last month. But his shares in Evraz are in his own name, as are two mansions he owns in Colorado ski towns. A spokesperson for Abramovich declined to comment about Evraz.

While the Pueblo mill now has far fewer employees than at its peak, it still puts out about half of all rail used in North America. And while it's no longer the biggest employer in the city, it's still the source of some of the best-paying blue-collar jobs in the region, local leaders say.

""Just about everyone that's a resident of Pueblo has had family that's worked out there,"" some going back four generations or more, said Jeff Shaw, president of the Pueblo Economic Development Corporation.

How Russia's war could affect Colorado steel

Most people in Pueblo don't really think of the mill as Russian-owned, according to interviews with city leaders and local residents. Instead of referring to it as Evraz, locals still call it CF&I -- Colorado Fuel and Iron -- or just ""The Mill.""

But the new ownership became impossible to ignore over the last few weeks, when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.

Chuck Perko, the president of one of the two United Steelworkers unions that represent workers at the plant, said he got ""dozens of phone calls"" about the potential impact in the days after the invasion and after the UK and EU governments announced sanctions against Abramovich.

""Retirees are worried, will the company continue to exist, will their pensions stay solvent?"" he said. ""Families want to know, is my husband or wife going to have a job tomorrow?""

In the weeks since, however, Perko said he hasn't seen any real impact on the Pueblo mill's operations. ""I'm worried more about the people in Ukraine than I am about my people being affected by it,"" Perko added.

Evraz says it's business as usual in Pueblo. David Ferryman, the Evraz North America senior vice president who runs the Pueblo plant, said watching the war in Ukraine was ""heartbreaking,"" but argued that critics of Evraz were painting any connection to Russia with ""a broad brush.""

""We have our own CEO, we have our own board of directors ... we're about as American a company as it gets,"" said Ferryman, sitting in a room in the company's Pueblo office with walls covered in historic photos of the plant. ""Those earnings stay here in North America, and they're invested into these facilities.""

The US government has not publicly explained why it hasn't targeted Abramovich with sanctions like the UK, EU and Canada. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked President Biden in early March not to sanction Abramovich, who has acted as an unofficial go-between for Moscow and Kyiv, in order to allow him to play a role in the peace process, according to two sources with direct knowledge. The Wall Street Journal first reported Zelensky's request.

It's unclear how active or central Abramovich has been in the negotiations since then. A Kremlin spokesperson confirmed that Abramovich was involved in peace talks, and he was present at a meeting between the two sides in Istanbul last week.

Treasury Department officials were examining sanctions on Abramovich that would exempt Evraz's US plants as part of a wide-ranging effort to limit economic fallout of new sanctions, the sources said. A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment about the potential of US sanctions on Abramovich, saying the department doesn't preview sanctions.

David Ferryman, senior vice president at Evraz North America, is pictured in front of the Pueblo steel mill.

According to sanctions experts, if the US does sanction Abramovich, the Treasury Department would likely issue a license allowing the Pueblo and Portland steel mills to continue operating in order to avoid any impact on American employees.

""If 1,000 Americans are going to lose their jobs, that could impact their decisions,"" said Charlie Steele, a former Treasury Department and Department of Justice official who worked on sanctions policy.

Even without US sanctions, the UK, EU and Canadian actions appear to have complicated Evraz's financial picture, between its stock being suspended from the London exchange and the near-miss in its bond payment. And the broader impact of sanctions can be unpredictable, especially if financial institutions decide they want to avoid the potential stigma of working with companies linked to Russia, experts said.

Even if banks are allowed to work with the company, Steele said, ""they might say, I'm not going to get within 100 miles of that.""

Russian investment in America's industrial heartland

Cranes tower over a construction site for a new steel mill that will produce longer segments of rail.

While many major US businesses have expanded in Russia over the last two decades -- and are now cutting ties -- Evraz is a rare example of investment flowing in the opposite direction.

There are a handful of other US steel plants in the country with ties to Russian oligarchs. NLMK, one of Russia's largest steel companies, owns plants in Pennsylvania and Indiana. And Severstal, another major Russian steel producer, bought several plants around the US, including in Mississippi and Michigan, before selling them in 2014 as tensions escalated over the invasion of Crimea.

Meanwhile, other proposals for Russian investment in US manufacturing have fallen through over the last decade, in some cases because of past sanctions -- including plans for factories in Louisiana and North Carolina

Most notably, in 2019, Russian aluminum company Rusal announced with great fanfare a $200 million investment to build an aluminum factory in eastern Kentucky, promising hundreds of new jobs in the economically struggling region. The investment came just months after the Trump administration lifted sanctions on Rusal -- which had previously been run by oligarch and Putin ally Oleg Deripaska -- amid an extensive lobbying campaign by the company.

Buttons are illuminated on a panel in a control room at the Pueblo steel mill on March 29.

But the Kentucky factory plan fell apart in recent years as Rusal backed out, leaving an empty greenfield and angry state legislators trying to claw back a $15 million taxpayer investment in the project.

By all accounts, Evraz has done the opposite. Workers say that their new owners have been far easier to work with than the previous, Oregon-based management, whose contentious relations with unions led to years of strikes and labor disputes . And they're thrilled with the new investments Evraz is making in Pueblo, which have led to a bevy of construction cranes stretching up into the sky around the plant.

""Locally, Evraz has been a great partner,"" said Jerry Pacheco, the executive director of the Pueblo Urban Renewal Authority, which has helped fund the expansion.

The company is in the middle of building a new $700 million steel mill that will produce much longer segments of rail, helping them compete for contracts to build high-speed rail lines and other rail projects. The project is set to receive at least $84 million in public incentives from the city and state governments and the urban renewal authority, and potentially up to $118 million — with certain requirements including retaining jobs and paying higher property taxes in the future.

Evraz has invested more money into the Pueblo expansion in recent years than any capital project at its facilities around the world, according to the company's annual reports.

Steel is cast at the Evraz mill in Pueblo on March 29.

Evraz also just finished a solar power project that makes it the first steel plant in the world to be powered almost exclusively with solar power -- putting it on the cutting edge of green manufacturing. A sprawling field of solar panels now lies just beyond the historic mill buildings, swiveling to face the sun and stockpile the energy needed for the mill.

The public incentives were crucial in keeping Evraz in Pueblo: The company had been exploring the possibility of moving its operation to another state before city leaders agreed to kick in the funding, and Gradisar argued that the taxpayer money was well worth it. ""Good jobs for blue-collar workers, those are hard to come by in this day and age,"" he said.

Moral dilemmas at an 'All-American' mill

Pueblo Mayor Nick Gradisar says the Russian connection to the Evraz mill is not a big concern for him.

Like many communities across the US, Pueblo is stepping up to help Ukraine. The county sheriff donated unused body armor to the Ukrainian military. A boy scout troop held a fundraiser for Ukrainian scouts at the local Pizza Ranch. A new mural painted on the levee of the Arkansas River, which runs through the city, displays the colors of the Ukrainian flag and a sunflower, the country's national flower.

But there's little public consternation or debate about Pueblo's close ties with a company accused of potentially supplying Russia's war effort.

""It's not a big concern for me right now,"" Gradisar, the mayor, said of the Russian connection to the mill. He said he wanted to see stability at the plant: ""Those are tough operations to operate and run, and you need to know what you're doing.""

""I've had people suggest to me we should seize the mill, whatever that means,"" Gradisar added. ""I didn't even respond to that.""

Cars drive through downtown Pueblo on March 29.

Other Pueblans agree that they're not bothered by the Russian ownership. As she waited for a lunch table at Estela's Mill Stop Cafe, a popular Mexican joint around the corner from the Evraz offices, Carol Trujillo said she never thought of the company as Russian-owned before the latest string of headlines.

""To us, it's All-American,"" she said of the mill, listing her relatives who had worked there over the years: uncles, aunts, a brother, her grandmother. ""I don't think the ownership matters to what the people do here.""

Some officials in Canada have called on Evraz to divest from its steel mills there, to avoid any connection with the invasion of Ukraine. ""That is actually the way out of this in terms of the balance between needing to support Ukraine and accepting those sanctions and protecting the employment and the ... livelihood of those workers,"" Sandra Masters, the mayor of Regina, Saskatchewan, which is home to a major Evraz plant, said last month

Perko, the union president, and several other steelworkers said they would be happy to see Abramovich's shares sold off, or the mill return to American ownership.

""We're fairly independent to the point that if something were to really happen, we could be ripped away from the parent company and run independently,"" Perko said.

Daniel Duran, an accounting clerk with Evraz, admits he has felt a moral dilemma for working for a company with Russian ties.

Some steelworkers said they've been feeling the moral dilemma of working for a company with ties to Russia. Daniel Duran, an accounting clerk who has been at the mill for five years after a string of nonunion, low-paying jobs in construction and at Walmart, said he loves working at Evraz, and credits the job for letting him give his four children a good life in Pueblo.

""Honestly, this job has afforded me everything I have today,"" Duran said. ""I have always thought of this place as being American hands forging US steel.""

But when he's turned on the news to see Ukrainian families fleeing Russian tanks, he said he's found himself getting emotional. ""I have my own kids, so it makes it tough to sit there and see all this stuff going on and try turning a blind eye,"" he said.

Sitting in his empty union hall, a 100-year-old Mission Revival-style building with long cracks running up the walls, Perko said that watching the videos from Ukraine reminded him of his own family history: his grandmother fled the Soviet army as a refugee from Yugoslavia during World War II.

""I disdain what's going on over there,"" Perko said of Ukraine. ""But my company is not Abramovich's company in my eyes -- and so it helps me sleep at night to know that we've got so much separation from the larger picture.""",,[],"['Casey Tolan', 'Audrey Ash', 'Cnn Photographs Rachel Woolf For Cnn']"
"A tale of two steel mills, and yet they’re the same one","The new solar array not far from where the Arkansas River winds through Pueblo, Colorado, is unlike any other in the world: It powers a steel mill. Just about all of it. 24/7. That’s a first.

Consider this: 750,000 solar panels on 1,800 acres of sun-drenched high plains providing 300 carbon-free megawatts to EVRAZ steel.

Steel had long been the backbone of Pueblo’s economy from the time the first mill was built in the late 1800s. So it’s no small irony that a renewable and non-emissions source of power is being used for a carbon emissions-intensive industry, one built on iron and coal in a city that has evolved from a one-time blue collar Democratic bastion to more conservative in recent decades.

The Pueblo experience may provide lessons for other communities around the world that, like Pueblo, have feared losing their traditional economic base and jobs long-rooted in fossil fuels.

A ‘win, win, win’ proposal … if only …

The Pueblo experience also offers something of a blueprint for others to consider regarding the importance of communication, trust, and imagination. In Pueblo’s case, a bit of lucky timing also helped. But the process still required bringing together folks who likely don’t routinely agree. They included players from several often-opposing industries, elected and non-elected community and civic leaders, the state, and also active and engaged local residents.

“Each of them had something the other desired,” says Dave Ferryman, senior vice president of EVRAZ North America’s Pueblo business unit. “We had what I would call a win, win, win proposal. If we could get the parties to agree.”

Pueblo’s steel mill has cycled through owners, boom times, bad times, bankruptcies, new beginnings, and more. When it was acquired by EVRAZ in 2007, the operation was already using an electric arc furnace instead of a traditional blast furnace. An arc furnace makes new steel out of old steel – everything from old washing machines to – in EVRAZ’s case – the remnants of Mile High Stadium in Denver, onetime home of the Broncos NFL football team. That process knocks down carbon emissions by up to 75%.

But an arc furnace needs a lot of power – more power than anything else in Colorado.

“We’re the largest energy consumer in the state of Colorado,” Ferryman says. “That’s not necessarily something we’re proud of, but a necessity for our business. So we need energy; we need affordable energy.”

That need was particularly strong given a new mill EVRAZ was planning to build to manufacture rails for train tracks in 320-foot sections instead of the customary 80-foot rails. Without more affordable power than it had, EVRAZ might decide to build the new mill in one of the other states it was actively considering. “There was a lot of concern locally that this could be the beginning of the end for Pueblo steelmaking,” Ferryman says.

How to begin: ‘We just started having meetings’ across the community

But something else happening at the same time changed the whole trajectory.

Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest power provider, had been supplying electricity to the mill complex from three coal plants – Comanche 1, 2, and 3. The prices tended to be high and also inconsistent.

Xcel didn’t know the steel mill was considering moving when the State of Colorado issued a mandate in 2017 requiring power providers to get to 80% carbon-free power by 2030. The first step Xcel wanted to take was to close Comanche 1 and 2 in 2023 and 2025 respectively, about 10 years earlier than planned.

“It was important to start talking with our community about that transition,” says Hollie Velasquez Horvath, who handles state affairs and community relations for Xcel in Colorado and has family in Pueblo. “So we just started having meetings.”

What Xcel heard at those meetings was that, along with concerns about losing jobs at the Comanche plants, Pueblo was worried the steel mill would simply up-and-leave.

Bringing all parties together seemed like the only way forward.

EVRAZ needed affordable energy. Xcel needed carbon-free power. Pueblo needed to keep its industry and the jobs and tax base that came with it.

The answer was literally sitting in EVRAZ’s backyard, those 1,800 sun-bathed acres.

“We have a lot of land that really isn’t good for agriculture, or much anything else – just very desert-type environment in and around our facility,” Ferryman says. “But a lot of sunshine and a lot of land.”

The solution was solar.

“The conversations weren’t necessarily driven by the climate side of it, but the solution came from that,” says Jeff Shaw, president and CEO of the privately-run Pueblo Economic Development Corporation, PEDCO. “We had to get guaranteed lower rates. And this was the way that we can do it.”

Complexity of deal yields to time, effort, and ‘a little creativity’

It was a complicated deal though. “The most complicated one we’ve ever worked on in 40 years,” Shaw says.

In addition to EVRAZ and Xcel, the parties included solar developer Lightsource BP. Half-owned by BP, the company was tapped to build, own, and operate the installation – now known as Bighorn Solar. Also involved were the city of Pueblo; the county of Pueblo; PEDCO; and others.

Each put in time and effort to understand the nuances of difficult technical and financial processes. It took more than a little creativity to get through some unique twists and turns, starting with the mill’s power being supplied by Xcel, but not the city’s power.

In addition, it took a bit of doing to convince EVRAZ that solar was going to make more sense than coal for a 24/7 operation.

‘We had to find a way … or risk losing the mill.’

Further complicating the conversation: The steel mill is actually located in Pueblo County, not in the city. So to tap the city’s dedicated tax fund for capital or economic development, PEDCO had to figure out a way for the city to annex a portion of where the new rail mill would be located.

“Necessity is the mother of invention,” says Terry Hart, a county commissioner at the time. “We had to find a way to make this work, or we stood the chance of losing the steel mill.”

Residents of the community had to be involved early and at every step.

“We had to educate them on what they were doing, why they’re doing it, the economic impact of the mill that it has right now, and then what the projected economic impact would be after expansion,” Shaw says. “Overall, the community was wildly supportive.”

With all that, the deal took less than two years to pull together. Some $95 million in a variety of incentives was secured, and so too was a 20-year fixed rate power purchase agreement for EVRAZ.

Since the fall of 2021, two years after the deal was announced, Bighorn Solar has been providing power to EVRAZ.

“The best thing that Pueblo did was not put up a roadblock and decide at that moment when we started talking with them that they were going to fight this plan and fight the realities that coal plants were being decommissioned and coming offline,” Horvath of Xcel says. “Instead, they engaged.”

Lots of winners, the climate among them

Pueblo is among several winners, as are efforts to address climate change. Coal has basically been eliminated from the mill. The third Comanche coal plant still running the mill and online only since 2010 now is to be retired in 2034 – 36 years ahead of schedule. Combine those carbon savings with the solar power and savings from mined iron and coal no longer needed, and the mill will produce 1/30th the carbon it might have otherwise.

Xcel has two more solar installations under construction in the area – 550 megawatts of grid power and storage. They will produce tax revenue, jobs, and the kind of climate change-consciousness and cleaner environment more and more businesses and residents seek when choosing where to locate.

EVRAZ, having gotten a consistent energy price, has stayed, and its planned new mill is under construction.

The local community college is getting money for job training, and in addition to the mill jobs increase, there will now be jobs for solar installation.

Xcel says it is already applying the lessons of Pueblo to help retire two coal units in another part of the state. And they’re talking to their large customers about sustainability goals and making positive impacts on climate change. “So for them to have a large utility-scale solar farm that generates a majority of their power, man, what a great story,” Horvath says.

Pueblo County appears now to have the solar bug. It’s hoping to land solar industry manufacturing and supply chain companies. It’s planning to build a net-zero jail with a solar array that will generate electricity for the jail and for the grid.

Had the folks in Pueblo looked only at their existing businesses and customers, Ferryman says, chances are EVRAZ would have moved, and Xcel might have never come up with an alternative after shutting down the coal plants.

“When people come together that don’t necessarily work well together,” he says, “If you can get the parties to sit down and talk, you can find alternatives that end up being wins for everyone. And that’s really what happened here.”

The lesson, says Chris Wiseman, a Pueblo County commissioner: “Just be open to any ideas.”

“You’ve got to trust each other,” he says. “We have our little scrapes from time to time because competing governmental entities do, but when it comes down to what we need to create jobs and create a better environment in Pueblo I think for the most part we’re all on the same page.”

From Shaw of PEDCO, who says he couldn’t have envisioned the Pueblo scenario even five years ago: “The easy lesson is if it can be pulled off for a large steelmaker, there’s really no industry that it can’t work for.”",,[],['More Jan Ellen Spiegel']

VIDEO: Destruction of steel factory in Mariupol,"The Azovstal iron and steelworks, one of the largest in Europe, has been severely damaged during the siege of Mariupol, it was reported on 20 March.

""One of the biggest metallurgic plants in #Europe destroyed. The economic losses for #Ukraine are huge. The environment is devastated,"" said Ukrainian lawmaker Lesia Vasylenko taking to Twitter. She backed up the tweet with pictures of the destruction caused to the site.

One of her colleagues, Serhiy Taruta, wrote on Facebook that Russian forces ""had practically destroyed the factory"".

""We will return to the city, rebuild the enterprise and revive it,"" Azovstal's director-general Enver Tskitishvili wrote on messaging app Telegram, without specifying the extent of the damage.

Since February 24, the factory has been out of action and measures have been taken measures in order to minimise the environmental damage in the event of being hit. The factory has only been taken out of action twice before: once in 1941 and once in 1943.

'A chance to survive': Ukraine's fortress steel mills,"Zaporizhzhia (Ukraine) (AFP) – Food and water stockpiles, generators, toilets, stacks of mattresses and even wood-burning stoves in bunkers deep underground -- the Soviets built this Ukrainian steelworks with war in mind.

Advertising Read more

A sister plant of the Azovstal mill that's the last redoubt of Ukrainian forces in the port city of Mariupol, the Zaporizhstal factory shows how these Stalin-era sites are designed to defy Russia's invasion.

""We can stay in the shelters for a long time,"" said Zaporizhstal employee Ihor Buhlayev, 20, in his hooded silver safety gear as molten metal flowed and sparked behind him. ""I think it will give us the chance to survive.""

Buhlayev's workplace in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia was not taken in Russia's internationally condemned attack, though the plant had to halt operations as the front drew dangerously closer.

The bunkers underneath the giant Azovstal and Zaporizhstal plants were built in the early 1930s, when the world recovered from one war while plodding towards another, and they are intended to shelter thousands of workers.

Both plants are under Metinvest Holding, which is controlled by Ukraine's richest man Rinat Akhmetov.

There are 16 bunkers at the Zaporizhstal works, and the one AFP visited was about 10 metres (about 30 feet) underground and protected by a roughly 10 centimetre-thick blast door.

The bunkers underneath the giant plants were built in the early 1930s and are intended to shelter thousands of workers Dimitar DILKOFF AFP

The long, brightly lit room has rows of wooden benches and is supposed to be able to hold 600 people.

Tanks of water can flush the toilets, emergency food and bottled water are stacked in a storage room, and there are chest-high stacks of firewood for the oil barrel-sized metal stove.

Another kind of war

The bunkers under Azovstal sheltered hundreds of civilians, many of whom left the site in an international rescue operation, and still offer refuge for the holdout forces resisting full Russian control of Mariupol.

""God forbid we find ourselves in a situation like our colleagues from Azovstal, metalworkers like us, who ended up staying for so long (in the shelter)... I wouldn't wish that on anyone,"" Alexander Lotenkov, communications department head, said inside the bunker.

Above that shelter, the roughly 5.5-square-kilometre site has about half the footprint of Azovstal but is still massive and the only way to efficiently get between its units is on a vehicle with wheels.

The size of the site is one thing, but the sheer number of places to hide among rows of buildings and tunnels below the site, as well as observation posts from its tall structures, is another.

But war, in this case, has not been good for business.

War has not been good for business Dimitar DILKOFF AFP

Reduced operations have been back up and running since the beginning of April, the same period when the Russians were forced by fierce Ukrainian resistance to retreat from areas around Kyiv.

Some good news came this week with an American announcement to suspend tariffs on Ukraine-made steel, but the situation is still dire.

Ukraine accounts for only about one percent of US steel imports, according to American authorities, who had imposed the 25 percent protective tariff, and logistics is a major challenge for Ukrainian exporters with the usual transport routes shattered by the war.

""We won't be able to compete with other producers, because their logistic expenses are lower and for us to export to the US we need now to get our production from Zaporizhzhia to Poland,"" the site's general director Alexander Mironenko told AFP.

Steel exports have plunged to a fraction of their pre-war levels and getting back up to speed and to market will be key for the Ukrainian economy.

""It was one of the primary export-oriented industries in Ukraine and around 50 percent of foreign currency income was generated by the metallurgical and mining sectors of Ukraine,"" Mironenko added.

U.S. Steel to locate $3 billion steel mill in Northeast Arkansas,"When Big River Steel first started operations near Osceola in Mississippi County in 2014, it was one of the largest industrial projects ever in the state of Arkansas. BRS, now owned by U.S. Steel, is about to get a companion steel mill and it will rival the first plant in terms of money spent and jobs created.

U.S. Steel Corp. announced Tuesday (Jan. 11) it would locate a new $3 billion steel factory in Osceola, a move expected to create 900 jobs with an average pay over $100,000 annually. It is the largest capital investment project in Arkansas history.

The new optimized steel production facility is expected to feature two electric arc furnaces (EAFs) with 3 million tons per year of advanced steelmaking capability, a state-of-the-art endless casting and rolling line, and advanced finishing capabilities. Upon completion, the project will apply to become LEED certified, the company said.

“With this location selected and shovels ready, we are reshaping the future of steelmaking,” said U.S. Steel President and CEO David Burritt. “We had numerous competitive site options, but Osceola offers our customers incomparable advantages.”

“Arkansas has created an ideal business environment for the growth of the steel industry in our state,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. “The investment and high paying jobs that will result from this announcement will make a real difference in the lives of many families in Northeast Arkansas. I am grateful for the support of the legislature which was critical in winning this expansion. Now, U. S. Steel is an important part of our future and we look forward to continued success in the coming years.”

Dubbed “Project Blueprint,” the steel mill will begin construction in early 2022.

“The state of Arkansas, Mississippi County, the city of Osceola, Entergy, BNSF, and other parties have all worked to make this the clear choice for a path to the future without roadblocks. We’re not going to make our stakeholders wait to see progress. We intend to break ground this quarter and get to work as soon as permits are in hand. With its extraordinarily low-cost structure, energy efficient production equipment, and advanced capabilities, this $3 billion project will yield significant benefits to our customers, stockholders, communities, employees, and contribute to a more sustainable world,” Burritt added.

Shares of Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel Corp. (NYSE: X) closed trading on Tuesday at $24.39. The company’s stock has traded between a low of $16.13 and a high of $30.57 over the past 52 weeks.

“The news this afternoon from U.S. Steel is exciting and is a testament to the workforce and environment we have in Northeast Arkansas to support this incredible growth by our steel industry,” said U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Jonesboro. “This expansion will create hundreds of direct and indirect jobs for our area, which will have far reaching impacts across the entire region. I am proud to have supported our local leaders, steel company representatives, and the steel industry as a whole while serving in Congress and will continue to advocate for American steel and steelworkers.”

Arkansas wasn’t the only state in the running for the mill. Alabama and Mississippi were also in the running for the mill. To land the project, Arkansas lawmakers put together an incentive package during a special session in December.

State economic developers convinced the legislature to put up $50 million in Quick Action Closing Fund money for site infrastructure. That money was moved from a reserve account during the special session.

Lawmakers also had to adapt recycling tax credits for the steel industry during the session. Those recycling tax credits will cost the state an average of $11 million a year for 14 years and $8.8 million a year if the state buys back the tax credits at a 20% discount. The legislation passed creates a new project type for steel manufacturers to qualify for an income tax credit for waste reduction, reuse or recycling equipment.

There are a number of qualifiers for the tax credits to be utilized. The steel mill project has to be located on the site of or adjacent to an existing qualified manufacturer of steel; have a total investment of at least $2 billion; create 700 new direct positions with an average annual wage of $120,000; and create 200 new independent direct positions with an average annual wage of $60,000, according to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration.

Mississippi County, home to Nucor and BRS, has become the largest county in the U.S. for steel production. Billions of dollars of infrastructure investment and thousands of jobs in the region rely on the steel industry. According to U.S. Census data, Mississippi County has seen a population decline every decade since the 1950s. Once home to over 82,000 residents and heavily dependent on an agricultural economy, Mississippi County now has about 40,000 residents.

There are more than 20 steel-related businesses in the county employing more than 3,600 workers. That’s about 1 in every 5 jobs in the county. There are low land and utility costs for businesses locating in Mississippi County. Access to the Mississippi River is complemented by interstate and rail access that criss-crosses north and south, east and west.

'They never expected Mariupol to resist.' Locals horrified by Russia's relentless attack on the vast steel plant shielding Ukrainians,"Lviv, Ukraine — Few beyond the metals industry had heard of Mariupol's Azovstal Steel and Iron Works before it became the scene of a desperate last stand against Russia's invading forces.

Until recently Azovstal was a major player on the global stage, producing 4 million tons of steel annually and exporting the majority across the globe, according to its owner Metinvest Holding, Ukraine's biggest steelmaker.

From London's Shard skyscraper to Hudson Yards in Manhattan to Genoa's San Giorgio Bridge (which replaced the collapsed Morandi Bridge), steel produced at Azovstal is used in some of the world's most recognizable landmarks.

But for weeks now, the world has been gripped by the battle raging over the steelworks on the coast of the Sea of Azov.

The pocket of Ukrainian fighters entrenched at the plant has become a symbol of the country's unwavering resistance in the face of an enemy that far outnumbers them

Yuriy Ryzhenkov, CEO of Metinvest Holding which owns the plant, is devastated by what he sees happening to the plant and to Mariupol.

""The city's literally under siege for almost two months now. And the Russians, they don't allow us to bring food into the city or water into the city,"" Ryzhenkov says.

""They're not allowing us to take the civilians out of the city in a centralized manner. They make the people either move out in their own automobiles or even walk by foot through the minefields. It's a humanitarian disaster there.""

Asked why Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to take Azovstal so badly, Ryzhenkov tells CNN, ""I don't think it's the plant that he wants.""

""I think it's about the symbolism that they wanted to conquer Mariupol. They never expected Mariupol to resist.""

At least 150 employees have been killed and thousands remain unaccounted for, he says.

Smoke rises above the Azovstal plant as nearby buildings were flattened to the ground in Mariupol on April 18.

""What we know is that out of the 11,000 employees at Azovstal,"" says Ryzhenkov, ""only about 4,500 people got out of Mariupol and got in contact with us so we know their whereabouts.""

He seems haunted by the fate of Azovstal's workforce.

""For the last two months, the whole company tried to do anything possible to get the people to the safety. Unfortunately, at the moment, we're still not even half-way there.""

The company's staff includes family dynasties who have made steel for as long as they can remember.

Ivan Goltvenko, a 38-year-old human resources director at the plant, is the third generation of his family to work at Azovstal.

""I hoped I would work for Azovstal all my life and will contribute a lot to the fabric and to my city,"" he says sadly.

""Seeing your city being destroyed is horrible, You could compare it to a relative dying in your arms ... And seeing him or her dying gradually, organ after organ failing, and you can do nothing.""

From the city of Zaphorizhzhia, he finds it hard to watch the scale of the devastation wrought by Russian airstrikes ""because you want your city to remain the same as it was in your memory.""

News of what's happening back home is filtering through from friends and colleagues who are still trapped in Mariupol.

""Today, for example, I was shown a video of my apartment. Despite the fact that the house survived, my flat is completely looted by Russian soldiers. Nothing valuable was left -- they even rummaged among the children's toys, and many of them were stolen.""

Part of a destroyed tank and a burned vehicle are pictured in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces in Mariupol on April 23.

He says he spoke to one colleague on April 24 who revealed some of the horrors with which residents are being confronted.

""From one of the employees, who has a connection, we know that he is in the city, he didn't manage to leave, and he has been involved in debris removal and transporting the bodies of dead citizens,"" Goltvenko says.

""And yesterday he told me that for one day from only one district of the city, I would even say 'from only one street' he loaded four trucks of bodies.

""He said: 'I was drawn to volunteering at the morgue to collect bodies in the city and take them away.'""

""For that,"" says Goltvenko, ""he receives a dry ration.""

His colleague, 49-year-old Oleksiy Ehorov, deputy head for repairs, has lived in Mariupol since he was a child.

""I studied there, I started working there, there I've become the person who I am now. And seeing how it has been destroyed ... You can't tell it without tears, without a lump in the throat,"" he says.

The agony is not over. Russian jets and missiles continue to pummel the site despite Putin saying last week there was no need to storm the industrial area around the plant.

The defenders of Azovstal have repeatedly refused to give up their weapons. There are thought to be hundreds of soldiers and civilians still in the plant.

Before the war

What has happened at Azovstal is a mirror image of what's happened to a city proud of its history and industrial heritage.

The industrial port city was perhaps never conventionally beautiful, with chimney stacks emitting smoke and steam into the sky over the plant. At the port, blue and yellow cranes moved heavy items around the bustling shipyard. But Mariupol had its charm and was beloved by its residents.

In recent years, major improvements had been made, green spaces were developed and quality of life for the working-class communities was at last improving.

""The last eight years we've spent on building a modern and comfortable city there ... a good city to live in,"" Ryzhenkov says.

""We've completed some major environmental projects, and there were still plans to make sure that we have clean air, that we have clean water and so on and so forth. And now we're seeing all that is being destroyed in less than two months.""

A view of Mariupol's port, taken by Mariupol native Maryna Holovnova last June.

Holovnova used to run tours starting from Mariupol's Old Water Tower near Theater Square.

Maryna Holovnova, 28, says ""it was like a living dream"" because ""we had worked towards turning the city from just industrial small town to a cultural capital.""

The Mariupol native returned in 2020 after a 10-year absence to find a burgeoning social scene. ""It was completely different,"" she tells CNN, proudly adding it had even been designated Ukraine's Cultural Capital last year by the Ministry of Culture.

""We had so many festivals and we had so many people coming from other cities and from other countries as well,"" she continues. ""We got a chance to tell the people about the city not only from the perspective of industrial development, but also from a cultural point of view [and] from the historical point of view -- because Mariupol has an amazing history.""

A beaming smile spreads across her face as the former city guide remembers the route she'd take visitors on. It would start at Mariupol's century-old Old Water Tower, she says, before winding around the city center, taking in its many historic buildings and locations tied to home-grown personalities.

Holovnova says with the waterfront metropolis continuing to thrive, a sailing tour was introduced last year, and plans were underway to launch an industrial-themed excursion complete with a factory tour showcasing the process of steel production.

""One of my favorite places, which was weird as locals wouldn't understand me ... was an observation point from where you could see the whole Azovstal factory and you could see how big it was, how huge it was, how great it was,"" she says. ""For locals it was nothing special because we get used to it but all the foreigners, people from other cities, they were amazed by the view.""

Holonova, a former Mariupol city guide says her favorite spot in the city was this viewpoint looking across to Azovstal.

City under siege

The blossoming of Mariupol was an unlikely story, because it was swallowed by the violence of the 20th century. It was the scene of bitter fighting in World War II.

This time, the devastation is even greater. Ukrainian officials say less than 20% of the city's buildings are unscathed. Russia's merciless bombing campaign has left rubble where landmarks like the Drama Theater once stood. Ukrainian officials say about 300 of the estimated 1,300 civilians who had sought sanctuary in the cultural institution are believed to have died when it was bombed in a brazen attack by Russia on March 16.

A man walks past the shell of Mariupol's Drama Theater on April 25.

The same applies to Azovstal. Built in 1933 under Soviet rule, it was partially demolished during the Nazi occupation in the 1940s before being rebuilt.

Now it is gone again -- its carcass sheltering Ukrainian soldiers and around 1,000 civilians in a maze of underground chambers, according to Ukrainian officials.

Azovstal was partially demolished during the Nazi occupation in the 1940s.

An estimated 100,000 people remain in the city. On Thursday, local authorities warned Mariupol was vulnerable to epidemics given the appalling sanitary conditions in much of the city and the fact that maybe thousands of bodies remain uncollected.

Oleksiy Ehorov can't bear to think of what has happened to his city -- and his family. His mother-in-law died from injuries sustained from shelling during their first attempt to flee to Zaporizhzhia.

""My emotions disappeared already there in Mariupol. That's why there's nothing but hate,"" he tells CNN.

Ehorov says he loved living by the sea and had hoped to stay at the steelworks until he retired.

Now all he can do is watch as Russia continues to blockade the city and his former workplace.

When asked if he'd work under the Russians if they take the factory, he echoes Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man and the main shareholder of the group behind Azovstal steel.

Spain's electric steel mills cut output amid soaring power prices,"The logo of Spanish stainless steel manufacturer Acerinox is pictured during the ""Tube Fair"" in Duesseldorf, Germany, April 7, 2016. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay

MADRID, March 10 (Reuters) - Spanish steel makers have cut output at their electric-powered mills after power prices skyrocketed to record highs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Andres Barcelo, the general director of national steel producers' association UNESID, told Reuters on Thursday that the steel mills halted production on the afternoon of March 8.

Since then, many have been producing at a reduced rate to lower costs, UNESID and some local steel producers said.

Electricity costs have surged in tandem with gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, creating a headache for power-intensive industries like steel, as producers are unable to transfer all the increase in costs to their customers.

Wary of signing long-term contracts with utilities, which would lock in current high prices, steel makers have resorted to buying electricity on the spot market where prices are at record highs, a spokesperson for ArcelorMittal (MT.LU) said.

As a result, ArcelorMittal has stopped operating during peak hours, or about one third of the time, at its Olaberria plant in the Basque Country, the spokesperson said.

The company will also extend a scheduled closure of another plant in nearby Sestao for 10 days until March 23, and plans to close a third plant in Gijon, in Asturias, between March 24 and 28.

Spanish stainless steel maker Acerinox (ACX.MC) said it had halted production at its only plant in Spain, in Algeciras at the southern tip of the country, while privately held producer Celsa, whose Barcelona mill has an annual capacity of 2.5 million tons, also cut output, citing unbearable energy costs.

""We are meeting the demands of our customers but our furnaces are operating at different hours to adapt to electricity prices,"" a Celsa spokesperson said.

Other privately held steel makers such as Megasa and Siderurgica Balboa also halted output at least in part.

To protect steel makers, UNESID has asked the government to change regulations to decouple electricity from international gas prices.

U.S. to Lift Tariffs on Ukrainian Steel,"Ukraine is a significant steel producer, ranking 13th globally. Most of the country’s factories and other economic activity have been frozen as workers are called off to fight and shipments of parts and raw materials are disrupted during the war. Many major Ukrainian steel mills halted their operations in late February because of major disruptions to logistics routes required to ship metal out of the country, analysts at S&P Global said.

The senior Commerce Department official said that Ukrainian steel plants had been cut off from some of their more traditional markets in the Middle East and Africa, as the war closed shipping lanes through the Black Sea. In order to continue to support its plants, the Ukrainian government is now aiming to move steel by rail to Romania, and then on to markets in Europe, Britain and the United States, the official said.

The Commerce Department has noted that the steel industry is uniquely important to Ukraine’s economic strength, employing one in 13 people there.

A steel mill in Mariupol under siege by Russian forces sheltered thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians for weeks. Russian and Ukrainian officials said on Saturday that all the women, children and elderly people who had been trapped for weeks in the plant were evacuated.",,[],['Ana Swanson']
Two Ukraine Steel Mills Set to Restart Production,"At least two Ukraine steel manufacturers are ready to restart production amid the ongoing conflict with Russia. Sources indicate this is because the areas where the mills are located have seen less impact from the invasion. Global investors greeted the announcement with much fanfare. After all, the renewed export of Ukrainian steel will undoubtedly have a significant impact on European markets.

A Major Steel Producer Comes Back Online

Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal Kryviy Rih, a longs producer in the country’s second-largest city, is set to bring Blast Furnace No. 8 back online on May 2. This is according to CEO Mauro Longobardo, who made the announcement in the April 8 issue of the plant newspaper, Metallurg. Longobardo went on to say that Blast Furnace No. 6 will resume operations “in the coming days.”

ArcelorMittal Kryviy Rih also expressed plans to return rolling production to the “highest possible level” by May 10. At the same time, the company plans to resume exports of iron ore concentrates. However, Longobardo made it clear that these actions are contingent on both logistics and the military situation. Currently, the plan is to dispatch finished products to Poland via train.

“It used to go by sea, but now we will transport it by rail first to Poland and from there to our customers,” Longobardo added.

Ukraine Steel is Crucial to the Country’s Economy

When Russia invaded back on February 24, Arcelor Mittal announced it would slow down production at Kryviy Rih to a technical minimum. However, AMKR is located in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, which has so far not experienced much fighting. Though the war appears far from over, many Ukranian businesses are eager to get the economy rolling again.

The Ukrainian steel industry typically comprises around 15% of the country’s economy. This is meaningful, as the World Bank estimated that the war will shrink Ukrainian GDP by as much as 45%. Altogether, mills in Ukraine can produce about 20 million metric tons of finished and semi-finished steel products. Before the war began, some 70% of this amount was exported. Were exports to continue, it might help alleviate wartime financial problems.

Indeed, Arcelor Mittal alone can produce around 6 million metric tons per year of crude steel via the BF/BOF Route. Its steel is mainly cast into billets. These are then rolled into long products, such as wire rods, rebar, and merchant bar.

Metinvest Joining the Fight to Boost Steel Production

On April 12, Metinvest, an international mining and steel enterprises company, announced that it had restored operations at its sinter plant. The company also said that it was in the process of blowing in two of the four blast furnaces at its Zaporizhstal joint venture.

Zaporizhstal, located in the southeast, is Ukraine’s fourth largest steelmaker. “Gradually, with the production of hot metal by the blast furnaces, subsequent links in the production chain will be put into operation as well,” the group stated. They later added that Zaporizhia Coke and Refractory have also resumed operations.

Metinvest reports a 49.9% stake in Zaporizhstal. However, one source told MetalMiner that this is closer to 100%. This is because the remaining stake originally belonged to “a group of Russian investors.” Of course, since the war began, the Ukrainian government has started confiscating all Russian-owned assets.

Zaporizhstal Represents Significant Metal Output

Zaporizhstal lies some 550 kilometers southeast of Kyiv. According to Metinvest representatives, the site’s four blast furnaces can produce up to 3.8 million metric tons (mmt) of pig iron annually. Meanwhile, its seven open-hearth furnaces and single bath furnace can pour around 4 mmt of crude steel.

Zaporizhstal’s Mill 1680 can also make up to 3.6 mmt per year of hot-rolled sheet and coil in multiple gauges and widths. Further downstream, the plant has an annual capacity of 1 mmt for cold-rolled coil. In this case, Rolling Shops #1 and #3 produce gauges of 0.2-5 mm gauges and 850-2,300 mm.

Ukraine Steel Production Rolls on in Some Areas

Another Metinvest operation is Kamet Steel. The company acquired it back in June 2021, when it was known as Dneprovsky Iron & Steel Integrated Works. Situated near Dnipro, this longs producer has managed to operate as normal virtually the entire war.

Kamet Steel site can pour up to 3.5 million metric tons of crude steel per year. The company casts nearly all of this into square and round billet. It then makes these billets available for commercial sale. They can also roll the billet into roughly 1.8 million metric tons of long products or ship them to Metinvest’s Promet subsidiary in Bulgaria.

The fact that Metinvest and ArcelorMittal Kryviy Rih are restarting production is undoubtedly good news. What effects will renewed steel export have on Ukraine’s overall economic situation? It’s hard to tell . However, European investors are undoubtedly eager to see anything returning to “normal.”

Two vital sources of neon for chipmaking just shut down in Ukraine,"Two companies based in Ukraine that make a majority of neon gas used in part of the process to print the most advanced chips have shut down because of Russia's invasion, Reuters reported Friday.

Should the two neon suppliers remain shut down for a prolonged period — months, rather than weeks — it could disrupt chip manufacturing, especially for businesses that don’t have a stockpile. Ukraine produces roughly 25% of the world’s neon, which is a byproduct of steel manufacturing, according to Bernstein Research. Large semiconductor manufacturers such as Intel or TSMC typically store two to three months of the gas, and there may be as much as three months worth of neon moving through the supply chain.

The two Ukrainian companies, Ingas and Cryoin, produce 45% to 54% of the neon used in chip manufacturing around the world, according to Reuters. Neon is used as part of the lithography stage of chip manufacturing, the step that involves using lasers to draw features onto the silicon wafers. Chipmakers account for 75% of global demand for neon, with the remainder going to industrial lasers and Lasik eye surgery, according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.

Rasgon estimated that the industry wouldn’t experience disruptions for the next “several months.” But if the war drags on longer, there will be problems, he wrote in a research note distributed Monday.

“Many large semi companies are on long-term contracts though so gas companies will absorb at first, but large semi players may have an advantage over small ones,” Rasgon wrote. “Beyond this, the industry is capable of paying up and shouldering high prices to secure supply as neon is tiny part of the cost structure; industrial lasers / lasik etc. may ultimately get starved first (so get your eye surgery now).”

According to Reuters, the two Ukrainian companies have halted operations, and a Cryoin executive warned that if their equipment is damaged during the fighting it would make restarting production much more difficult. The same executive also warned that it wasn’t clear where the company would access the raw materials needed to purify neon gas.

"The U.K. Government Places Sanctions on Evraz Steel, Owner of Oregon’s Largest Steel Mill","The economic consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continue to mount. On May 5, the British government announced it is sanctioning Evraz PLC, the giant steel company whose largest shareholder is Roman Abramovich, the wealthy Russian industrialist.

In a statement, the British Foreign Office said it was taking the step because of the central role Evraz plays within Russia’s economy. (The company has its headquarters in London).

“Evraz PLC produce 28% of all Russian railway wheels and 97% of rail-tracks in Russia. This is of vital significance as Russia uses rail to move key military supplies and troops to the front line in Ukraine,” the Foreign Office said.

“Along with existing measures, this action will further deter companies operating in strategic sectors in Russia. Today’s asset freeze means no UK citizen or company can do business with them. Evraz PLC’s core operations are in Russia where they are a major employer. These sanctions will further chip away at Putin’s financial reserves and siege economy, and support Ukraine’s continued resistance.”

Evraz owns a large steel rolling mill in North Portland, acquired in 2007 when it purchased the company then known as Oregon Steel. The company also operates a mill in Pueblo, Colo., and four facilities in Canada. So far, the U.S. government has taken no action to curtail the company’s operations.

The U.K. and Canada announced sanctions against Abramovich in March. The U.S. did not, reportedly at the request of Ukrainian officials who hoped he could play a role in negotiating an end to the invasion.",,[],[]
