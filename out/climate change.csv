Climate change portends more heat,"Temperatures hit 100 for the first time in a decade yesterday at the same time many suburban residents were without power due to storm damage.

As we slog through these steamy days, it's natural to wonder — is this just a typical heat wave or a bigger part of our future with climate change?

Why it matters: The science is pretty clear that we're in for more of this.

""One of the most high-confidence conclusions of climate science is that human-caused global warming is raising the odds of, as well as the severity and longevity of, extreme heat events. That likely includes this one,"" says Andrew Freedman, Axios' climate and energy reporter, who recently reported on this record-breaking heat wave.

Zoom in: A new analysis from nonprofit climate research company Climate Central shows that Chicago is seeing an average of seven more summer days above normal temperature than in 1970.

The latest: We're in for at least two more days of this heat, but the worst is expected to end on Friday.

Be smart: At a press conference yesterday, Office of Emergency Management and Communications chief Rich Guidice advised residents to:

Stay hydrated.

Open windows and close shades if you don't have AC.

Don't leave people or pets in the car.

""Be aware of the cumulative effect with extreme heat and how it affects you in the coming days, even after the temperatures cool down.""

Pro tips: Use 311 to request a wellness check on loved ones, but Guidice advises calling 911 if someone is suffering a heat-related medical emergency.",,[],"['Monica Eng', 'Https', 'Www.Axios.Com Local Chicago Authors Meng']"
"A look at state efforts to combat climate change in 2022, so far","Story at a glance Party politics have long hindered comprehensive federal action on climate change. As the summer of 2022 kicks off with soaring temperatures across the country, the League of Conservation Voters looks back at legislative victories achieved by individual states this year. In the following states, new bills, rules, and budgets have subtly incorporated climate action into agendas, marking incremental steps forward in the fight against climate change.

Amid extreme heat waves engulfing the nation and striking footage of floods deluging a national park, it’s difficult to ignore the palpable effects of climate change already altering everyday life.

And although the failure of President Biden’s Build Back Better bill in the Senate may have signaled a roadblock for those calling for tougher federal action on climate change, a series of actions at the state level implemented or introduced in 2022 offer some hope, at least on the local front.

Here are what states have achieved thus far in 2022 after taking matters into their own hands, according to a compilation from the League of Conservation Voters (LCV).

Maryland

In Maryland, the state’s legislature passed the Climate Solutions Now Act which includes the nation’s strongest carbon pollution reduction goal by committing the state to net-zero emissions by 2045. By 2031, the state will need to cut emissions by 60 percent, marking the boldest near-term goal in the United States.

The act also includes provisions allocating resources for low-income residents to prevent further climate-related harm to vulnerable communities and allows for school bus fleets to transition to electric buses. Maryland’s governor, Republican Larry Hogan, has said the act will go into effect without his signature.

Connecticut

SB10, passed in April, made Connecticut the 14th state to commit to 100 percent clean energy via legislative action, while an additional bill, SB4 committed the state to California’s Advanced Trucks Rule. Together, the two bills include provisions that will commit the state to all electric school buses by 2035 with particular emphasis on driving adoption in low-income communities and communities of color. The state plans to transition to 100 percent clean energy by 2040.

Colorado

New financial requirements for oil and gas companies were unanimously approved by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. The requirements center on reducing risks of orphaned oil wells and will significantly increase bond amounts oil and gas producers must provide to cover clean up costs. In addition, new fees will help raise money to fund plugging of abandoned wells.

The state also passed Air Toxics Rules (HB22-1244) to monitor toxic air pollution with particular focus on the state’s vulnerable communities. Under these rules the state is required to establish health-based standards for certain pollutants.

HB22-1193 was passed to provide funds supporting the “just transition” from coal to clean energy.

New Mexico

In 2022, New Mexico’s Environmental Improvement Board adopted new ozone rules aimed at preventing methane emission leaks at oil and gas production facilities which account for the majority of the industry’s methane problem. The state also adopted a Clean Car Rule which will reduce emissions and smog-causing pollutants from new passenger cars and trucks beginning in 2026 by increasing the number of electric vehicles on the road. By 2050, the rule is estimated to eliminate approximately 130,000 tons of greenhouse gasses in the state.

Maine

Within Maine’s Climate Action Plan, the state now requires integrated grid planning which will serve as a foundation for a clean power sector. It will also be among the first in the nation to mandate assessment of grid plans’ environmental, equity, and environmental justice impacts. LD 1959 says public input from experts and those outside utility companies should be incorporated into the plan.

New Jersey

A5160 updated appliance efficiency standards in the state and was passed with bipartisan support in the state’s legislature in January. The state’s plastic bag ban also recently went into effect, barring single-use plastic or paper bags in grocery stores and banning all styrofoam containers like those used for take-out food.

New York

The New York state budget passed this year included funding to require all new school bus purchases to be zero-emission beginning in 2027. By 2035, all school buses will be zero-emission, while $500 million was also allotted for electric school buses and charging infrastructure specifically aimed at serving disadvantaged communities.

Come November, the $4.2 billion New York Environmental Bond Act will be on voters’ ballots and seeks to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind supply chains and clean water infrastructure.

Washington

A $17 billion transportation package passed by the Washington state legislature will invest billions into new public transit and alternative transportation. The money will be invested over the next 16 years and will allow all public transit riders under the age of 18 to ride for free. An ultra high-speed rail, hybrid-electric ferries, and more investments in walking and biking infrastructure in underinvested communities are all included in the package.

Michigan

Michigan passed a $4.7 billion budget bill aimed at cleaning up and protecting the state’s water and removing lead pipes used for drinking water. The investment will also support funding state and local parks in addition to repairing roads and bridges.

The state’s governor, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, this year released a comprehensive climate plan with the aim of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. The plan seeks to retire all coal plants by 2030 and transition to 60 percent clean energy in the next decade and allocate 40 percent of the state’s budget to fund climate and water infrastructure initiatives targeting the state’s underserved communities. On the conservation front, the plan aims to protect 30 percent of the state’s land and water by 2030 and ramp up electric vehicle charging stations to support 2 million electric vehicles.

California

Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, announced a $9.5 billion addition to his climate budget as his state faces one of its largest budget surpluses in state history. Advocates are also pushing for the Clean Cars and Clean Air Act to appear on the state’s ballot in November. This would invest around $100 billion in new revenue over the next two decades to expand electric vehicle and zero-emission vehicle charging and fueling infrastructure. It would also help fight and prevent wildfires, and be funded via a 1.75 percent increase on personal income taxes among residents making over $2 million.

Virginia

The Virginia League of Conservation Voters worked to remove Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist and head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Trump, from consideration for the state’s highest environmental position, Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources.

The group also worked to defend the Virginia Clean Economy Act and its participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The initiative comprises 11 states working to cap and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector and is the first such regional group to do so in the United States.

Florida

Advocates in Florida pressured Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to veto HB 741 which would have ended net-metering, whereby utilities are required to pay customers who produce excess power from their rooftop solar panels which is then re-distributed to non-solar customers. The defeat means solar will remain affordable in the Sunshine State, allowing more customers to install the panels on their roofs.

Illinois

A coalition led by the Illinois Environmental Council successfully halted SB1104 which would have effectively undercut the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act by creating a task force of mostly fossil fuel industry representatives charged with offering recommendations on renewable energy reliability. The bill also would have duplicated reporting requirements and protocols put in place to ensure clean energy reliability.

Wisconsin

Democratic Gov. Tony Evers introduced his Clean Energy Plan marking “the strongest roadmap to climate justice and clean energy in Wisconsin history,” according to memo authors. Under the plan, by 2050 all electricity consumed in the state would be 100 percent carbon free. It would also create an estimated 40,000 new jobs by 2030 by investing in clean energy, and prioritizes the state’s Tribal Nations in the planning process.

North Carolina

In an executive order, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper detailed how the state plans to reach a 50 percent reduction in carbon emission by 2030 compared with 2005 levels and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest. In addition, under the plan, 50 percent of all new vehicle sales in the state must be zero-emission vehicles by 2030. Gov. Cooper also directed cabinet agencies to identify an environmental justice leader and consider environmental justice when implementing new actions on climate change.",,[],"['Gianna Melillo', 'June']"
Study: Climate change affects mental health of young Oregonians,"Anger. Guilt. Shame.

Young people in Oregon say they’re experiencing these emotions as they face the impacts of climate change, according to a study released on Tuesday by the Oregon Health Authority.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

The agency’s report, Climate Change and Youth Mental Health in Oregon, highlights how extreme weather events like wildfires, heatwaves, snowstorms and drought are creating fear, frustration, and hopelessness among young people. OHA partnered with the University of Oregon’s suicide prevention unit to host virtual focus groups with people between ages 15 and 25 and interviewed professionals working in mental health, education and public health.

“We want to see more youth mental health support in schools and in our communities,” Mecca Donovan, a 23-year-old from Eugene, said. “We want to see youth invited to the table and decision making.”

Donovan, who helped host the focus groups, said she wants to see more accountability and acknowledgment of the challenges young people are facing.

Thousands of area youth climate activists and supporters marched through downtown Portland on May 20, 2022. The Oregon Health Authority issued a report on Tuesday detailing the impacts of climate change on the mental health of young Oregonians. Kristyna Wentz-Graff / OPB

One of the key findings from the report said young people often feel dismissed by older generations and not taken seriously by elected leaders.

“Burnout is just really, really bad,” Eliza Garcia, a recent UO political science graduate, said. “I think that’s the biggest thing that I’ve felt within the movement and the biggest thing that I’ve had other people my age or younger than me talk to me about, it’s just the burnout that comes from having to feel like we’re doing this all alone.”

Garcia said she felt pressured to switch her focus to climate justice because more action is needed.

“I felt very much I had to work on it and very much like, ‘if I’m not working on this issue right now, then what am I doing?’” she said.

Garcia said she’s turned down events and opportunities so she can fight against climate change and that pressure has affected her mental health. She said she’s particularly concerned about younger activists.

“Now there’s kids, you know, middle school, like, beginning of high school that are getting into it and when you’re starting that young, I can see that these kids are getting burnt out already and they’re not even 20 yet,” she said.

Andres De La Rosa-Hernandez, 25, is a peer-to-peer support specialist in Monmouth. He provides support for people between the ages of 14 to 25 and helps them with life changes or issues they are going through. He said a major concern is all the climate change information young people receive on social media.

“They see an article about the polar ice caps melting or about rising water, anything like that it’s hard for them to focus on whatever they’re working on when they think about how the world is ending around them,” De La Rosa-Hernandez said.

He said he’s also feeling the same burnout from having to deal with so much at once. Most of the people in his circle also feel the same way.

Shayanne Summers holds her dog Toph while wrapped in a blanket after several days of staying in a tent at an evacuation center at the Milwaukie-Portland Elks Lodge on Sunday, Sept. 13, 2020, in Oak Grove, Ore. ""It's nice enough here you could almost think of this as camping and forget everything else, almost,"" said Summers about staying at the center after evacuating from near Molalla, Ore., which was threatened by the Riverside Fire. John Locher / AP

A conversation he has repeatedly had with his wife is whether they want to have children and what their future would look like. De La Rosa-Hernandez said they ask themselves if they really want to bring a child into such an uncertain world.

Another emotion De La Rosa-Hernandez deals with is survivors’ guilt. During the 2020 Labor Day fires, he said he received messages from friends that their homes were on fire or had to evacuate. This prompted him to pack his bags and be ready to go but his area did not have to evacuate.

“While I was very thankful to the universe that I didn’t have to evacuate, I didn’t lose all my stuff, I stopped and thought about everyone who did lose things and ended up with a survivor’s guilt of ‘why was it me?” he said. “Like is it just the area I’m living in? Why did the universe, I guess in a way punish them and not me?’”

Julie Early Sifuentes, an OHA program manager and the study’s lead author, said the report was designed to elevate youth voices and to better understand what steps are needed to help youth feel hopeful. She said she hopes the report will generate conversations among families and local organizations and inform policy decisions within state and city agencies.

OHA completed the report under Gov. Kate Brown’s executive order 20-04 which directs state agencies to act and regulate greenhouse gas emissions and study the harmful effects of climate change. The report concluded with the importance of sharing power in decision-making about climate and mental health policy and solutions. It also suggested increasing funds for mental health services to provide for schools and communities in need.",,[],[]
Could humans become smaller in response to climate change?,"As climate change intensifies, humans will shrink for a better chance of survival, according to a professor of paleontology.

He points out that mammals in hotter regions tend to be smaller than those in colder areas.

But other experts are sceptical that rising temperatures will cause humans and other mammals to adapt in this way.

They note that resource availability is more likely to determine how we evolve.

Throughout history, species have evolved to adapt to their changing surroundings. Now, with skyrocketing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and intensifying climate change, some experts believe humans will evolve to better withstand the warming world.

Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology at the University of Edinburgh, expects humans to shrink for a better chance of survival in the face of climate change. Brusatte turned to an early species of horses, which evolved to have a smaller body size as temperatures warmed during the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum, about 55 million years ago.

He noted it is “eerie” how similar the plight of the horses then and humans now are, but the similarities could give us insight into the future of human evolution.

In his book, “The Rise and Reign of the Mammals,” Brusatte points out that mammals in hotter regions tend to be smaller compared to mammals in colder regions, possibly because the smaller surface area compared to volume can help animals cool down. Brusatte has also turned to the example of Homo floresiensis, an archaic type of human that once lived in Flores, an Indonesian island, about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Scarce resources led these ancient humans to grow only to about 3.5 feet tall.

In a warming world, many species, including modern-day humans, could become smaller to survive.

“That’s not to say every species of mammal would get smaller, but it seems to be a common survival trick of mammals when temperatures spike pretty quickly,” Brusatte told The Guardian. “Which does raise the question: if temperatures do spike really quickly might humans dwarf, might humans get smaller? And I think that’s certainly plausible.”

A 2021 study found relationships between temperature and body size, although it also found that temperature had no effect on brain size. Still, some experts are skeptical that warming temperatures will cause humans, or even other mammals, to evolve to be smaller, noting that resource availability is more likely to have an impact.

“We are not really controlled by natural selection,” said Adrian Lister, a palaeobiologist at the Natural History Museum in London. “If that was going to happen, you’d need to find large people dying before they could reproduce because of climate warming. That is not happening in today’s world. We wear clothes, we have got heating, we have got air conditioning if it is too hot.”",,[],"['Paige Bennett', 'Written By', 'Olivia', 'Rosane', 'Hannah Ritchie', 'Our World In Data', 'Victoria Masterson', 'Emma', 'Musaab Almulla', 'Samah El-Shahat']"

"Climate change is a public health crisis, AMA says","The American Medical Association has declared climate change a public health crisis that threatens the health and well-being of all people. The new policy mobilizes the AMA to advocate for policies that limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions aimed at carbon neutrality by 2050, and support rapid implementation and incentivization of clean energy solutions and significant investments in climate resilience through a climate justice lens.

The organization will also develop a strategic plan for enacting its climate change policies, including on how to decarbonize physician practices and the health care industry. The new policy also recognizes the health, safety, and climate risks of current methods of producing fossil fuel-derived hydrogen and the dangers of adding hydrogen to natural gas.

“The scientific evidence is clear – our patients are already facing adverse health effects associated with climate change, from heat-related injuries, vector-borne diseases and air pollution from wildfires, to worsening seasonal allergies and storm-related illness and injuries,” said AMA Board Member Ilse R. Levin, D.O., MPH, in a statement. “Like the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis will disproportionately impact the health of historically marginalized communities. Taking action now won’t reverse all of the harm done, but it will help prevent further damage to our planet and our patients’ health and well-being.”

The policy is intended to build upon AMA’s existing policy and efforts to promote environmental sustainability and efforts to halt the global climate crisis, including policy to help physicians in adopting environmentally-sustainable programs in their practices and sharing these concepts with their patients and communities. As part of AMA’s ongoing commitment to address climate change, the AMA is a member of the National Academy of Medicine Action Collaborative on Decarbonizing the U.S. Health Sector—a public-private partnership among the health sector aimed at mitigating climate change and protecting human health, well-being, and equity by addressing the sector’s environmental impact.

"Climate change: More fossil fuel investment, just ‘delusional’, warns Guterres","António Guterres was speaking at the Sixth Austrian World Summit on the climate crisis, convened by the Austrian Government and former Governor of California and Hollywood actor turned climate activist, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Mr. Guterres repeated his call for G20 leading economies to “dismantle coal infrastructure, with a full phase-out by 2030 for OECD countries and 2040 for all others.”

The energy crisis exacerbated by the war in Ukraine has seen a perilous doubling down on fossil fuels by the major economies.



New funding for fossil fuels is delusional.



It will only further feed the scourge of war, pollution & climate catastrophe. https://t.co/ppM3pOaqna — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) June 14, 2022

Renewables: 21st century peace plan

He said renewable energy was “the peace plan of the 21st century” and called on fossil fuel finance to be abandoned wholesale, in favour of the green alternative.

And I call on all financial actors to abandon fossil fuel finance and invest in renewable energy.

“The only true path to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity and a liveable planet lies in abandoning polluting fossil fuels, especially coal, and accelerating the renewables-based energy transition”, he declared.

The window to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis is closing fast, the UN chief warned, and to keep the 1.5-degree goal of limiting global warming within reach, emissions must be cut by 45 per cent by 2030, with net zero emissions by 2050.

“But current national commitments will lead to an increase by almost 14 per cent this decade”, he said, while, energy-related CO2 emissions grew six per cent just last year, “when they should be falling.”

Not good enough

Let me be blunt: most national climate pledges are simply not good enough. This is not just my view. Science and public opinion are giving timid climate policies a giant fail mark.

“We are witnessing a historic and dangerous disconnect - science and citizens are demanding ambitious and transformative climate action. Meanwhile, many governments are dragging their feet.

He said grave consequences would be the result, with nearly half the world’s population already in the “danger zone”.

Broken mix

And, at a time when we should all come together in the fight for our lives, senseless wars are tearing us apart”, he added. “The energy crisis exacerbated by the war in Ukraine has seen a perilous doubling down on fossil fuels by the major economies. The war has reinforced an abject lesson: our energy mix is broken.”

The paradox, he said, is that cheaper, fairer and more reliable energy options should have been developed sooner, and faster, including wind and solar.

“Had we invested massively in renewable energy in the past, we would not be so dramatically at the mercy of the instability of fossil fuel markets.”

Solar energy and batteries have fallen in price by 85 per cent, over the past decade, while wind power has become 55 per cent cheaper.

“On the other hand, oil and gas have reached record price levels. And investment in renewables creates three times more jobs than fossil fuels”, argued the Secretary-General.

Solutions now

To counter today’s new economic shocks, he reiterated his five-point plan for action on renewable energy.

First, make renewable energy technology a global public good, including removing intellectual property barriers to sharing technology.

Second, improve global access to supply chains for renewable energy technologies components and raw materials.

Third, reform the red tape that is holding back the renewable production revolution.

Fourth, a shift in energy subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy, while addressing the potential consequences for the most vulnerable.

And fifth, a tripling in investments in renewables.",,[],[]

BJORN LOMBORG: Well, it seems to me that the tech companies would love to just simply say we're only saying nice, good, politically correct stuff. But of course, that's not what the tech companies and a free debate is about. It's about saying the true stories. And sometimes the true story is exactly the opposite of what the standard narrative is. Look, global warming is real, but it's not the end of the world. We should not scare our kids witless. And likewise, it's not going to be cheap. It's going to be fantastically expensive. Almost all studies show this. And we need to be honest about this.

"Euro seen as most resilient to climate change, yuan most exposed: Barclays","Climate change could play out to the advantage of the euro, while China’s yuan and the Japanese yen are set to suffer the most without greater efforts to mitigate the effects of global warming, Barclays said in a report.

The British bank mapped the effects of climate change on exchange rates, saying rising temperatures and associated economic costs could pose “rising and costly risk, with tangible FX impact”.

In the bank’s most severe scenario, the euro is the outperformer, appreciating 0.5% against the dollar by 2030 and 3.9% on average over the next five decades, with euro zone’s trade openness helping soften the economic impact of global warming.

In contrast, Chinese yuan could lose 5.5% by 2030, with a further a 7% depreciation over the next decade, which could worsen to more than 10% per decade over time.

Barclays said it used national productivity and capital flows forecasts for the next five decades to model how, given their current conditions, countries’ growth and consequently their currencies could be affected by climate change.

Rising sea levels, variation in crop yields, changes in the occurrence of diseases, tourism, or even heat-induced hits on labour productivity are some of the factors included in the analysis, Barclays analysts said in a report.

Worldwide losses from extreme weather events totalled $1.38 trillion in the previous decade, rising nearly eight-fold since the 1970s and are expected to top $2 trillion this decade, according to the report.

“Countries experiencing drops in productivity and other production inputs will likely also experience less capital inflow,” and as a result, weaker currencies, Barclays said.

The yuan could lose 53% of its real value over the next 50 years as a result of China’s rapid industrialisation over the past two decades and “lenient environmental policies,” it said.

“The risk of prioritising growth over environment and a lack of local environmental network (eg, NGOs, lawyers, journalists) remain significant challenges,” Barclays said.

For Japan, rising sea levels pose the biggest threat, it said, projecting environmental factors to shave almost 3% of the yen’s value by 2030. It could lose 55% in total over 50 years and become the world’s worst-performing currency as early as mid-century, the bank said.

The US dollar is seen outperforming, benefiting from “the diverse nature of the U.S. economy,” Barclays said.

Its model suggests the Australian dollar would also outperform despite similar exposure to rising sea risks as Japan, with commodity exports and trade openness limiting damage to growth, while emerging market currencies were seen coming under pressure.",,[],[]
Climate Change Likely to Slow Plant Growth in Northern Hemisphere,"ABOVE: Boreal forests like this one in Canada will likely see a decline in photosynthesis by the end of the century. © ISTOCK.COM, Onfokus

Plants are a highly effective carbon sink. Globally, forests absorb about 7.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, about 1.5 times the annual emissions of the United States.

Since the 1980s, climate warming, prompted by rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, has caused an increase in plant productivity in the Northern Hemisphere outside the tropics.

But new research published May 30 in Nature Climate Change estimates that summer warming in this region will begin to have the opposite effect within the next half-century, causing photosynthesis—or plant productivity—to decline. The global land carbon sink will likely take a hit as a result, the authors write.

The researchers found that generally in the Northern Hemisphere, warmer temperatures will mean less summer plant productivity by 2070 for most regions below 60° N—the approximate latitude of Oslo, Norway, and Anchorage, Alaska. Plant productivity in Arctic areas, however, will continue rising as the temperature increases.

“It’s an interesting paper,” says Kai Zhu, an environmental scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the research. The ability of vegetation to capture carbon has grown over the past few decades, but whether this would continue into the future was previously unknown, he explains. The research shows that increased temperatures will eventually lead to decreased photosynthesis, which “will be bad news.”

The study focused on the extratropical Northern Hemisphere because it is responsible for 40 percent of the planet’s terrestrial carbon sink, and the hemisphere’s productivity is strongly linked to temperature. In the tropics, water is a larger driver of productivity, so the researchers excluded this region.

Scientists used two different ways of estimating the effects of rising summer temperatures on productivity: models that represent photosynthesis based on a variety of environmental factors, and climate models combined with extrapolations from historical observations of the thermal tolerance of wild plants. Anping Chen, a study coauthor and ecologist at Colorado State University, explains in an email that researchers rely more on the first method because it takes into account factors like elevated CO 2 levels, changes in precipitation, and the acclimation of plants to warming.

Using eight Earth system models, the study found that under intermediate projected emissions conditions, about 48 percent of vegetated land in the Northern Hemisphere will experience a decline in plant productivity due to warming by 2060, rising to 78 percent by the end of this century.

The historical observation-based approach pushed this timeframe much earlier, coauthor Brendan Rogers, an Earth system scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts, tells The Scientist. Under the best-case scenario among possible outcomes, that method predicted that the temperature will exceed the optimum for productivity earlier than 2030 under intermediate emissions in more than 67 percent of the extratropical Northern Hemisphere.

Rogers says the Earth system model results may be too optimistic because they overestimate how well forests acclimate to climate change. The models don’t take into account factors like widespread fires, pests, and pathogens, he explains.

Whether the results mean that overall carbon in the atmosphere will increase even faster than it is now is “the 10 million dollar question,” because there are a lot of factors affecting the carbon balance, Rogers explains. But the paper is “another warning sign that all is not well with the planet,” he says. “And it's another reason to curb emissions.”",,[],['Full Profile.']
Climate Change is Shifting State Views on Nuclear Power,"Twin cooling towers rise into the sky at the Byron Nuclear Generating Station in Illinois. State legislators passed a law last year committing to keep the state’s nuclear plants online, even if they are unprofitable. Arturo Fernadez Rockford Register Star via The Associated Press

In many of the states with the nation’s most aggressive climate goals, officials are investing millions of dollars to save the power source that was long the No. 1 target of many environmental activists: nuclear plants.

“We are moving expeditiously toward a clean energy mix, but that is going to take a while,” said Joe Fiordaliso, president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. “We can't build renewables fast enough, and people still need energy. Nukes are an important interim part of the mix.”

Despite longstanding safety concerns, many state leaders and some environmental groups say climate change poses a greater risk than reactors, and that preserving nuclear power will prevent an expansion of fossil fuel-powered plants. Nuclear plants provide about 19% of the nation’s electricity, far more than wind and solar combined. Some activists counter that state investments in nuclear plants are coming at the expense of renewable projects, slowing the clean energy transition.

Illinois lawmakers passed a climate bill last year that included a commitment to keep two of the state’s nuclear plants online for five years, even if they are losing money. The state gets more than half of its electricity from nuclear generation, and state leaders said keeping the plants open will buy more time to transition to wind and solar.

“We can build enough renewables and storage to replace those plants, but it will take years,” said Jack Darin, director of the Illinois chapter of the Sierra Club. “[If nuclear plants shut down], we would see increased utilization of the existing very dirty coal plants, primarily in communities of color, and we would see huge advantages for natural gas to come in.”

Several other states, primarily on the East Coast, have pumped money into aging and in some cases unprofitable nuclear plants in recent years.

Jessica Azulay, executive director with the Alliance for a Green Economy, a New York-based environmental group that fought a 2016 state deal to subsidize nuclear plants, thinks that’s a mistake.

“It's an enormous amount of resources that are going to plants that are going to reach the end of their life soon anyway,” she said. “If we had put that money into renewables and efficiency, we would have gotten higher greenhouse gas reductions.”

Opponents also point to the environmental effects of uranium mining and processing, and ongoing concerns about the storage of radioactive waste. But reactors provide continuous, emissions-free power, advocates note, and safety standards have significantly reduced the risk of meltdowns.

Little New Construction

The debate largely centers on the preservation of existing plants. Some experts think small, modular reactors could be developed in the future, and Connecticut and West Virginia lawmakers recently revoked state bans on new nuclear facilities partially in case that technology becomes feasible.

But the only nuclear plant currently under construction, a project in Georgia, has run into substantial delays and cost overruns.

Earlier this year, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the state would seek funding to extend the life of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant under a $6 billion federal program to support nuclear power. The plant is slated for closure in 2025 under an agreement struck with environmental and labor groups in 2016.

“If Diablo Canyon shuts down, we would have to import additional capacity from outside California, and it's all going to come from gas and coal plants,” said Carl Wurtz, president of Californians for Green Nuclear Power, an advocacy group that supports the industry. “We need to put into proportion the dangers of nuclear versus the dangers of climate change.”

""We need to put into proportion the dangers of nuclear versus the dangers of climate change."" Carl Wurtz , president of Californians for Green Nuclear Power

Wurtz said California regulations make it difficult for power plants to remain profitable after their capital costs have been paid off because of rules that decouple profits from the amount of electricity sold, putting Diablo Canyon at a disadvantage. Newsom’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Pacific Gas & Electric, the plant’s operator, said plans to decommission the plant starting in 2025 are “full steam ahead.”

Anti-nuclear activists point to PG&E’s application to shut down Diablo Canyon, which said the plant’s large, inflexible power load may be crowding out renewables, and leaving the plant online could increase the costs of adding wind and solar to the grid.

“The nuclear plant actually blocks bringing on more renewables,” said Jane Swanson, president of San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace, an advocacy group that opposes the plant. “The loss of electricity from Diablo Canyon is not going to cause more fossil fuels to be used.”

A similar debate is going on in New Jersey, where regulators last year renewed for three years a $300 million annual subsidy to keep three plants open. Nuclear power supplies 35% of the state’s electricity, according to Fiordaliso, the state official.

Jeff Tittel, a longtime environmental activist in New Jersey, was serving as the director of the state’s Sierra Club chapter when the subsidy was created in 2018. He is in favor of keeping the plants open but said the state bailout was wasteful.

“They hid behind climate change as an excuse for the subsidy, and all the subsidy has been doing is enriching the stockholders,” he said. “This is money that could be used for wind and solar.”

‘Magical Thinking’

In Connecticut, officials made a deal in 2019 to procure power from the state’s Millstone nuclear plant for 10 years, part of a suite of projects for carbon-free electricity. According to state Sen. Norm Needleman, a Democrat who chairs the Energy and Technology Committee, the agreement provided a fixed price for the plant’s operator, Dominion Energy, allowing enough certainty to leave Millstone online.

Surprisingly, that price has saved ratepayers money in recent months, as the costs of other forms of energy have skyrocketed. The state is likely to seek an extension of the deal, he said.

“If you build your whole grid around intermittent renewables, you have times and days of the year where you don't have any wind or sun,” Needleman said. “Baseload power is critical, and nuclear is the cleanest form of baseload power.”

Save the Sound, a regional environmental nonprofit, initially pushed back on Connecticut’s attempts to subsidize nuclear power, but the group’s leaders now want to keep the plant open as an interim step.

“Sometimes there's a tendency to engage in magical thinking where the perfect vision of the future is immediately achievable,” said Charles Rothenberger, the organization’s climate and energy attorney. “This facility is currently providing significant amounts of zero-carbon energy, and we should be using that to give us the time we need to ramp up our clean renewables, but it can't dampen our investments.”

In New York, the state’s 2016 subsidy deal to prop up its nuclear industry is on track to cost ratepayers $7.6 billion by 2029, said Azulay, the New York activist.

“The state was being threatened with multiple reactor shutdowns all at the same time unless the state came up with a bunch of money to subsidize them,” she said. “We could have gotten more energy efficiency and renewables for the money, but now we’re just tying up money in something that's more expensive.”

New York officials dispute that characterization. Nuclear power made up 24% of the state’s electricity in 2021, according to the New York Department of Public Service.

“Had these upstate nuclear power plants abruptly closed, carbon emissions in New York would have increased by more than 15.5 million metric tons annually, resulting in public health and other societal costs of at least $700 million annually,” James Denn, an agency spokesperson, said in a statement.

In Illinois, the agreement reached to keep the state’s nuclear power online has saved ratepayers money. While lawmakers committed to supporting plants if they couldn’t remain profitable, they also limited the amount that energy companies could earn if prices increased. Rising prices for fossil fuels have made nuclear much more profitable, generating a refund for customers.

Despite the shift toward keeping nuclear plants open, longstanding concerns around public safety and nuclear waste remain.

Climate change, which has brought rising sea levels and more powerful storms, is increasing the risks, said Tim Judson, executive director at the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, an anti-nuclear nonprofit.

“Reactors are more vulnerable to these natural disasters than they were designed for,” he said, pointing to the 2011 nuclear meltdowns at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi plant after a tsunami.

But nuclear backers say the industry has learned from such high-profile disasters, and that American plants have high safety standards. They also note that far more people die every year because of pollution caused by fossil fuel-powered plants than have been killed in nuclear disasters.

“Fear of nuclear is really unjustified,” said Wurtz, the California advocate.",,[],[]
Forecasting the monsoon is complicated. Climate change made it a whole other game,"Forecasting the monsoon is complicated. Climate change made it a whole other game

The monsoon season starts officially across the Southwest on Wednesday. But even as it unfolds, what that will mean for Arizona this year is still pretty much anyone's guess.

What's known as the North American monsoon typically begins in early June in central and southern Mexico. It forms when summer heat results in a build up of atmospheric pressure that forces a shift in the predominant winds, from westerly (blowing from the west) to southerly (blowing from the south). These winds push air holding evaporated moisture from the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California over northern Mexico, New Mexico and Arizona, where it falls as rain, often in dramatic thunderstorms.

The monsoon rain that falls in Arizona during the season through September makes up around half of the state's annual precipitation. It's an essential source of moisture for wildlife, plants, agriculture and the reservoirs that supply drinking water the rest of the year.

But the blessing is mixed. Heavy monsoon rains flood neighborhoods and roads, which become hazardous, even deadly to cross. They cause power outages and property damage. And they create pools of standing water where mosquitos breed and spread disease.

Killer weather: How many have died in Arizona flash floods? More than you'd think

The Phoenix office of the National Weather Service estimates that there are half a million lightning strikes that ignite more than 2,000 wildfires in Arizona each season. Monsoon storms also bring a variety of other bizarre and often amusingly named weather threats, including haboobs, downbursts, gustnadoes, earth fissures and landslides.

For all of these reasons, Gov. Doug Ducey has declared June 13-19 Monsoon Awareness Week. And the Arizona Emergency Information Network, the National Weather Service and other agencies have assembled information on how to stay safe while weathering all of the upcoming season's various moods.

What's not included in these presentations is much guidance on what kind of monsoon temperament to expect.

Earlier this year, predictions were for the 2022 monsoon to be wetter than normal, following an especially dry monsoon in 2020 and an exceptionally wet season in 2021.

ICYMI - Here is the 2022 Monsoon Outlook: https://t.co/Dei3cGehF8



Monsoon Season is Jun 15-Sept 30. That doesn’t mean that t-storms will suddenly begin developing on these dates, but rather this is when to stay alert & aware of monsoon hazards from potential storms. #Monsoon2k22 — NWS Phoenix (@NWSPhoenix) June 13, 2022

But as the season opens, a video produced by the National Weather Service explains that ""the Climate Prediction Center precipitation outlook for this monsoon favors equal chances for near, below or above-normal rainfall across Arizona."" To be specific, the center estimates a 35% chance that southern Arizona will see above-average precipitation during the 2022 monsoon, a 33% chance it will be normal and a 32% chance it will be below normal. The odds for northern Arizona are split 33%, 34% and 33%.

That's not exactly helpful. So why is it so hard to predict what the monsoon has in store for Arizona?

Prediction, projection and preparation

Gaps in meteorologists' understanding of monsoon systems is not for lack of skill or effort. A legion of climate and atmospheric scientists have studied drivers of monsoonal patterns, anticipating the importance of these forecasts for water planning in the drought-stricken Southwest where Colorado River allocations are already hotly contested.

They've assembled research teams, datasets and statistical models that require the latest in computational power, and then published studies that, with a lot of technical terminology, generally conclude that no one can say with much detail or certainty what's going to happen with the North American monsoon under a warming climate.

What one paper published in 2019 in the journal Monsoons and Climate did suggest, after compiling results from recent studies, is that future monsoons may consist of sparser, more sporadic and stronger storms over Arizona. The same amount or slightly less rain falling on fewer occasions will result in more flood damage and less absorption into the soil. Thunderstorms may also be more likely to occur in Arizona's mountains, causing the wetter parts of the state to get wetter while the desert gets drier.

Who's to blame? Climate change is not your fault, but that doesn't mean you're off the hook

As for this year, it's still hard to be sure.

""It is very difficult to predict the monsoon season,"" said William Boos, an atmospheric scientist and associate professor of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of California, Berkeley, who has co-authored papers about monsoon forecasting.

""Seasonal prediction of climate is actually something that is still in its infancy. So, I think that if there is a prediction for a wetter than normal 2022, I would view that as a prediction that is not going to be very confident.""

This lack of self confidence in their own monsoon predictions is not an indication that scientists aren't sure if they know what they're doing. Rather, it's a reflection of how complicated our atmosphere is and how impossible it is for anyone, regardless of training, teamwork or computing power, to see into the future.

“There’s kind of two different topics here,"" said Paul Iñiguez, a meteorologist and the science operations officer at the Phoenix NWS office. ""You’re talking about projections of monsoons and how they fit into a warming climate several decades down the road. And then you’re also talking about predicting what’s going to happen with this year’s monsoon. And that’s a totally different process.""

Lightning fills the night sky during monsoon Lightning fills the night sky during the monsoon on Friday, Aug. 13, 2021 Michael Meister, Arizona Republic

His office mostly focuses on weather forecasts in the more immediate future, Iñiguez said, usually for the next seven days. At that point, you're more zoomed-in on the problem and you have more information about what the conditions already are and what they have been recently that can guide conclusions about what might happen next.

Weather forecasts for the next week may be more likely to be accurate than climate projections for the next decade. Or they might not be. It depends on how specific the forecaster is trying to be.

Iñiguez likens weather to the mood you're in on any given day, whereas climate is more like your personality, those underlying behavioral tendencies that play out over longer periods of time. Exactly where the distinction is between what constitutes a weather forecast and when it crosses over into a climate projection is a matter of internal debate within the scientific community.

Worsening wildfires: 'We don't have a season anymore'

What is certain is that, as soon as you try to zoom in on atmospheric phenomena, by trying to look closer at a specific time or place or pattern, the image gets grainy.

""A monsoon is a pretty grand-scale pattern of winds and atmospheric circulation that draws in water vapor from ocean regions and deposits it in the form of rainfall on different continents,"" said Boos. ""So it's actually a lot easier, it's a better formulated problem, to simulate and then project future variations in than it is to be confident about some individual cloud or thunderstorm.""

Leila Carvalho is a professor and climate scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who also tries to peak into the monsoon future and was a co-author of the 2019 paper in Monsoons and Climate. She further underscored the distinction between weather predictions and climate projections, and said it all matters for our ability to plan for what's ahead.

Arizona monsoon: Here's when to expect those summer storms

“A projection is usually something we expect to see over time, a trend. But from year to year, this will be a little different because there are other phenomenon occurring that will be part of the natural variability, so you’ll see a trend but also a lot of fluctuation,"" Carvalho said.

""Our brains are not organized to process things too far ahead. But that’s the distinction that people need to understand. If you are a decision-maker, if you are a politician planning for Arizona’s future, you have to look at both.""

Hedging bets on the forecasts

Psychologists agree that holding two opposing thoughts in your head at the same time is a difficult but important skill.

“People think that 'Oh, because it rained yesterday or it was cold, there’s no climate change and warming doesn’t exist,'"" said Carvalho. ""That’s the confusion that happens, because we humans perceive things with our instincts and our instincts are short term. But we have to start training our brains to think about the future and the present at the same time.""

Data can help. In Arizona, conditions in recent decades have trended warmer and drier. Scientists know this to be largely due to the increase in atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, mostly a result of burning fossil fuels, that hold more heat in the air and result in increased evaporation and drier soils.

As calculated by the policy-neutral nonprofit Climate Central, the average local summer temperature in Phoenix has has increased by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) over the past 50 years. There are nine more days per year when local highs exceed 110 degrees. The average summer overnight low has gone up 5.5 degrees.

In the beginning: Phoenix isn't what it once was because of climate change. But it's not too late to save it

Some of this is due to the urban heat island, where the concrete and asphalt of rapid development retain more heat than natural surfaces. But scientists understand about half of the observed warming to be due to the effects of climate change.

A warmer climate means more energy in the atmosphere and more extreme, chaotic weather events. With the past nine years among the Earth's top 10 hottest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, natural disasters like massive wildfires, flooding, hurricanes and ice storms have become regular events.

""We have now a climate on steroids,"" said Carvalho. ""If you have a player in baseball or basketball and they start taking steroids, the game is the same, the rules will not change, but that player, because he took the steroids, will jump higher and run faster.""

""What causes rainfall doesn’t change. We know the rules of the game. The problem is, we start giving steroids to the players and then, when it’s their time to play, they do a lot more than they would normally. That’s how the game is changing.""

Boos sees it in Kentucky Derby terms. As a society, scientific models can help us place bets on the most likely winner out of a fixed set of monsoon scenarios and plan for that end result. But we should be aware that there are other options at play and prepare for different outcomes. We can't afford to put all our resources into one best-case scenario, especially with climate change working against us.

""If I go to a horse race, certain horses may be more likely than others to win, right? If you want a good monsoon climate — adequate rainfall, not drought — that's the probability of a certain horse winning,"" Boos said.

Warming explained: How much of the heat can we blame on the heat island?

""As the climate gets warmer, it's going to become less and less likely that your favorite horse is going to win. Even though we don't know what's going to happen with the rain, we do know that we're evaporating more water. That's like (how) you maybe don't know what's going to happen with the jockey, but you know that a horse's health is declining. So, how are you going to change your bets?""

That's why Carvalho says it's time for the Southwest to prepare not only for this season starting on Wednesday, but for the effects future monsoons will have on society.

Major concerns will be water availability, wildfires and agriculture, she says, especially in Indigenous communities that don’t have as many ways to change or cope. Home insurance against natural disasters is also a growing challenge that will likely hit hard in Arizona.

""In recent years, we have had floods and hurricanes and wildfires displacing people,"" Carvalho said. ""The number of homeless people has grown exponentially. Where are they going? They don’t go to places like Minnesota or Chicago or North Dakota because they can’t survive. They are coming to the West Coast and to the Southwest.""

The horse to bet on, in this case, is working together to slow the climate crisis, experts say. Guidelines laid out by recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outline how.

“We need to deal with the energy crisis and the water crisis and figure out how we are going to deal with those things for the people living on this planet,"" she said. ""This is a problem for everybody, every color, red or blue or green.""

As the monsoon kicks off in Arizona, the lesson climate experts have gleaned from data and statistical models is that the world is complicated. Weather is complicated. Climate is complicated. Answers aren't always simple. But, much like psychologists suggest, the solution may lie in learning to ""live in the messy gray.""

Climate change: The issue on which Australians do not want both sides of the argument,"Credit: Digital News Report 2022, the University of Canberra

Should journalists always treat an issue even-handedly? Our research reveals that when it comes to climate change, many Australians would prefer they didn't. For general news, people want news outlets to reflect a range of views so they can make up their own mind about an issue. However, when it comes to news about climate change, four in ten say news outlets should pick a side.

That's according to new research that surveyed 2,038 Australians about their news consumption in relation to climate change. The Digital News Report: Australia 2022 survey was conducted by the University of Canberra between January 21 and February 16 2022.

There is a divide driven by political orientation on how people think news outlets should be reporting on climate change. More than half (51%) of those who identify as left-wing and 42% of those who identify as center of politics say news outlets should take a clear position. In contrast, only 24% of right-leaning audiences say so.

In fact, the majority of those on the right (66%) are in favor of news remaining impartial and leaving it up to people to decide. Revealingly, however, those who identify with the center are not on the same page as those on the right. Only 41% of those who identify with the center support impartiality on climate change.

These differences may partly be explained by varied levels of concern and where people get news about climate change.

Concern about climate change is becoming increasingly polarized across the political spectrum. On the left, 81% express concern, but only 32% of right-leaning consumers do. There is a disconnect on climate change between people who identify with the center of politics and those who identify with right-wing beliefs, particularly among those with higher incomes and in urban areas.

While more than a third (38%) of right-wing consumers regard climate change as a ""not very"" or ""not at all"" serious problem, centrists are more concerned, attentive to climate change news and willing to see journalists take a clear position on the issue. This may help understand the success of teal independents in the 2022 federal election, many of whom campaigned on climate action in traditionally center-right urban electorates.

News consumers in regional areas remain less concerned about climate change than those in cities, despite extreme weather events and bushfires disproportionately affecting regional areas. This may reflect the fact that higher proportions of older and more conservative Australians live in the regions.

It must be stressed the survey was in the field after a mild summer and before the severe floods in Queensland and News South Wales. This is possibly why the proportion considering climate change as a serious problem dropped by three percentage points. Now, three in four (76%) Australians regard climate change as a serious issue.

Encouragingly, rather than relying on celebrities and political parties, people go to experts and traditional news outlets for news about the climate crisis. The most popular sources of climate change news are scientists, experts and academics (50%), documentaries (33%) and major news outlets (27%).

Credit: Digital News Report 2022, the University of Canberra

There seems to be a small but important minority of Australians who have disengaged from the issue entirely. One in five Australians say they don't pay any attention to climate change news.

Again, we see a steep political divide in whether people pay attention to climate change news. Almost one-third (29%) of right-wing consumers are disengaged from climate change news, while 97% of left-wing consumers access news about climate change. This polarization has persisted and widened since 2020.

When it comes to reporting about climate change, Australians want less focus on individual responsibility (16%) and more attention on what governments and large companies should do about it (42%). Younger generations and left-wing Australians are particularly keen on both of these things.

The issue of climate change turned out to be serious enough to convince many to vote against traditional two-party lines, reshaping the political landscape and placing action on climate change as a spotlight issue for the incoming Labor government.

UK Insurers Need to Consider Climate Change Risks: Accounting Watchdog,"The UK’s accounting watchdog is proposing new rules for insurance companies to make sure actuaries factor in climate change risk.

“As the importance of climate change risks continues to grow it is critical that actuaries consider these risks in the course of their work,” Mark Babington, executive director of regulatory standards for the Financial Reporting Council, said in a statement Wednesday.

The move comes as regulators and insurers around the world get increasingly worried about climate risk after a rise in natural disasters. As many as 95% of insurance executives who took part in a BlackRock Inc. survey last year said that climate risk will have a major impact on how they build their portfolios over the next two years.

The FRC found that actuaries do a good job at taking into account more established risk areas, but do less well in considering non-traditional risks such as climate change, according to the statement.

The FRC’s consultation on the proposed changes closes on Sept. 7.

Carbon storage capacity in forests across the globe is only at 88% of its potential, according to a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), which sets out to help prioritize locations for increasing reserves.

The findings could assist the design of strategies to combat climate change, say researchers from the U.S.-based Woodwell Climate Research Center, as forest systems act like sponges, sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Improved management of existing forests, such as conserving native tree species and prohibiting logging, could help realize nearly three quarters of this unmet potential, the majority of which (71%) lies in the tropics, according to the study.

Among the top ten countries with the greatest potential are Brazil— second only to Russia—Indonesia, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, and Mexico.

Wayne Walker, one of the study authors, told SciDev.Net: ""The size of the untapped reservoir—the space on land that is available for additional carbon storage—is considerable: about 287 petagrams (PgC) after we set aside land that is critical to food production and human habitation."" A petagram (PgC) is equivalent to one billion tons.

Most (78%) of this unrealized potential is found in woody biomass, while 22% is in soil, according to the study, which combined existing data, field measurements and geospatial imagery to assess the gap between current and potential carbon storage.

To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, to prevent the average temperature increase from exceeding 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels, global emissions must remain below 250 PgC. At current rates, that amount would be reached by 2045, the study says.

In this context, researchers say it is essential to understand carbon storage capacity in order to advance so-called ""nature-based"" climate solutions, such as forest maintenance, improved management of degraded ecosystems, and restoration—planting trees where native forests have been felled.

The findings reflect the high rates of historic deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics, according to Walker. ""Generally speaking, countries with greater forest loss have larger land-carbon deficits and greater unrealized potential for additional carbon storage,"" he explained.

David Lapola, from the Center for Meteorological and Climate Research Applied to Agriculture, in Campinas, Brazil, disagrees with some of the study's conclusions.

""Long-term observational data is showing that the carbon sink strength in the Amazon has reduced 30% since the 1990's,"" he told SciDev.Net.

""Should that trend persist, the world's largest tropical forest will turn into a carbon source to the atmosphere in about 15 years. So how can we expect these forests to absorb even more carbon when there are projections saying their current carbon stocks won't persist?""

He said preserving existing forests and woody ecosystems and restoring degraded ones were among the actions needed to curb climate change. ""But I don't think we should count only on that to take us out of the planetary-scale problem we created,"" he added.

Changes in temperature and precipitation will affect the size of carbon stocks and ""across the tropics, the size of the available reservoir is likely to decrease,"" says Walker.

In Brazil, restoration accounts for less than 10% of potential climate benefits (related to carbon storage), according to the study. It says the greatest gains will come from focusing efforts where forest cover has been at least partially maintained.

""Any attempt to compensate an emission with an equivalent elimination will lead to an atmospheric concentration higher than if the emission had been avoided from the beginning,"" the study warns.

Lapola also warns of the risk of polluting countries or companies using carbon credit programs to ""offset"" emissions ""as a license to continue emitting.""

He said the study follows the common line of argument that responsibility for cutting carbon emissions lies with tropical nations and that issues of land tenure and funding are not addressed.

Actions needed to stop deforestation are ""relatively easy and Brazil has demonstrated in the past that it is doable,"" according to Lapola, but ""to contain degradation, we still have to understand way more deeply its causes and implications.""

He also stressed the need to advance carbon capture and storage mechanisms and REDD+ projects, which provides economic incentives to encourage developing countries to conserve rather than cut down forests.

""Global climate change, differently from deforestation and degradation, is not only up to tropical countries to solve,"" added Lapola. ""If there is no concerted global action to reduce emissions, tropical forests will suffer the impacts of climate change even if deforestation and degradation are curbed.""

The inclusion of health in major global reports on climate change and biodiversity - World,"Abstract

This article argues that human health has become a key consideration in recent global reports on climate change and biodiversity produced by various international organisations; however, greater attention must be given to the unequal health impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss around the world and the different health adaptation measures that are urgently required

Summary box

Most recent major global reports on climate change and biodiversity produced by international organisations emphasise the links with human health, which shows that health is becoming a central issue in climate change/biodiversity policy.

These major global reports emphasise the health impacts and the health cobenefits of mitigation action. They also focus particularly on food, air pollution and extreme weather events.

There is a lack of detailed attention in these reports on the need to adapt health systems and policies to the effects of climate change and biodiversity loss.

This includes a lack of consideration of the vast differences in the capacities of health systems around the world to adapt to these effects.

There is an urgent need for greater focus on the unequal health impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss, as these reports currently pay insufficient attention to the disproportionate consequences in low-income and middle-income countries, and on vulnerable groups.

Introduction

The relationship between human health and the natural environment has long been recognised. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in research on how climate change and biodiversity loss—resulting from anthropogenic pressures on the environment—negatively impact people’s health around the world. This research has focused on the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss on health, the need for health adaptation and on the ways in which measures to address climate change and biodiversity loss have a mutually beneficial effect on health. A key question is the extent to which this research has influenced wider political and public engagement with the health dimensions of climate change and biodiversity loss. Some, for example, have argued that health remains peripheral to climate change politics.

We consider this question by looking at the extent to which, and how, health is discussed in major global reports on climate change and biodiversity in recent years. These global reports play a crucial role in bridging research and politics, thereby shaping the global policy agenda. They do this in various ways—from synthesising the state of knowledge on these issues to inform policy decisions—to generating significant global media attention that influences public and political debates on climate change and biodiversity. Hence, these reports sit at the intersection of science, politics and public spheres.

We selected around 30 major global reports on climate change and biodiversity that have been published between 2018 and 2021 by relevant international organisations, and examined the ways human health was discussed in these reports. We did this through a combination of an automated search of health-related terms and more in-depth qualitative reading of the reports. Given these reports go into considerable detail on the different aspects of the relationship between climate change/biodiversity and health, there are major differences in how health is discussed across these reports. Hence, there is a risk that any common themes identified may be driven by the specific selection of reports. However, looking across these different reports, several broader issues emerge that we believe provide some important insights on current engagement with the health dimensions of climate change and biodiversity. We summarise these key themes, and their policy implications.",,[],[]
UVA to Invest $60 Million to Put Climate Change Solutions in People’s Hands,"What if you and your neighbors could work with University of Virginia experts to solve the climate-related problems in your town? What if clean energy solutions created in UVA labs turned into technologies to be shared with the world?

Developing cutting-edge research and putting it into action is motivating the University’s $60 million investment in a collaborative approach to climate change.

Through UVA’s ambitious Grand Challenge Research Initiatives, UVA researchers will pursue two avenues focused on environmental resilience and sustainability: researching and perfecting clean energy, and helping local communities develop best practices for responding to climate-driven challenges.

“These research teams are planning an exciting two-pronged approach,” Vice President for Research Melur K. “Ram” Ramasubramanian said. “On the one hand, we are focused on empowering local decision-makers with knowledge and resources. On the other, we are developing advanced clean-energy technologies by leveraging our scientific expertise in engineering and chemistry. We are investing in additional faculty to further strengthen teams and in state-of-the-art analytical and computational tools to make significant advances.”

Ramasubramanian, Provost Ian Baucom and Vice Provost for Academic Initiatives Megan Barnett are spearheading the Grand Challenges, which are part of the University’s 2030 “Great and Good” Plan, a set of strategic initiatives focused on service through collaboration.

“The Grand Challenges are part of our commitment to invest in research that will address some of the most challenging contemporary issues of our time,” UVA President Jim Ryan said. “As described in our 2030 Strategic Plan, we will engage scholars, researchers and practitioners from across the University, each of whom will bring new perspectives to the work, and we will make sure the results are widely distributed for maximum impact. I’m grateful to all those at UVA whose work will make the world a better place.”

Led by the UVA Environmental Resilience Institute, the community-based effort will include faculty from schools across the University in a newly formed Climate Collaborative. The group aspires to connect University researchers with policymakers, local officials and business leaders, as well as everyday citizens.",,[],[]
"Climate change could trigger toxic disasters along Lake Michigan, new report finds","Rising Lake Michigan levels, strong wind gusts and waves of nearly 10 feet high, all from extreme weather brought on by climate change, pose toxic threats to the entire lakefront — stretching from Zion to the Southeast Side and even to Northwest Indiana, a new analysis finds.

A just-released report examines possible climate-related disasters caused by high lake levels, powerful storms and erosion along Lake Michigan.

The report, by Chicago’s Environmental Law and Policy Center, largely focuses on toxic hazards in four states bordering the lake but also notes that densely populated neighborhoods — including Rogers Park, Edgewater and Uptown on the North Side and South Shore on the South Side — face potentially devastating flooding if weather patterns continue as they have. Large parts of those areas may face more severe flooding as much as a half-mile inland.

“Lake Michigan is where we live, work and play,” said ELPC Executive Director Howard Learner in an interview. “Climate change is forcing us to see another side of Lake Michigan.”

Using government data, study authors simulated different flood levels and mapped the potential impacts.

In a seven-year period that began with a historic low in 2013, the average level of Lake Michigan rose 6 feet. If those swings, along with high wind and waves continue, toxic-waste Superfund sites, a recently closed coal plant in Waukegan north of Chicago and a dismantled nuclear plant in Zion all represent an opportunity for water to “breach facility barriers and carry industrial pollutants to surrounding areas and into Lake Michigan,” the report said.

“A major storm surge, combined with high lake levels, could simultaneously flood streets, homes and businesses from Zion to the Southeast Side of Chicago,” according to the report, which also looked at hazards in Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan. “A major flood could also threaten public health by carrying contaminants, such as PCBs and heavy metals into populous neighborhoods.”

PCBs are shorthand for polychlorinated biphenyls, a once widely used cancer-causing industrial chemical, that is now banned.

The PCB chemicals are present at the former location of Outboard Marine, one of four Superfund toxic-waste sites in Waukegan. Those sites neighbor the recently closed NRG Energy coal plant and nearby coal-ash ponds. The other Superfund locations are Johns-Manville and two formerly operated by North Shore Gas. The combination of toxic sources — all built decades ago — in the city of almost 90,000 people makes it stand out in Illinois as they all “create significant risk and potential problems,” Learner said.

In addition to cleaning up the toxic sites and reassessing them as a potential threat, government officials need to consider natural remedies such as wetlands restoration and green infrastructure, such as vegetated landscaping, Learner said.

Zoning and planning also needs to be re-evaluated, he added.

“Policymakers need to rethink the Lake Michigan shore’s built environment,” Learner said, and “make decisions based on today’s realities.”

Just north of Waukegan, spent nuclear fuel is encased along the lake in Zion. The nuclear plant there was shut down in 1998 and its dismantling, now completed, began more than a decade ago. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said government officials continue to inspect the site to ensure that it’s safe and not a health or environmental hazard. But there’s no place for the fuel to be transferred and, therefore, there is not a timeline for removing it.

The ELPC report urges regulators to update their reviews for protection against potential flooding, something the nuclear commission spokeswoman said is ongoing.

On the Southeast Side, several locations, including a closed scrap-metal operation by Sims Metal, a dump for Calumet River dredged material and a shipping terminal managed by the Illinois International Port District all contain toxic materials that can spread to neighborhoods and into the lake if flooded, the report said.

Just to the east, in Northwest Indiana, a number of current and former industrial sites raise pollution concerns, including the U.S. Steel Gary Works and the now-demolished State Line coal plant, the report noted.

Other threats remain, including a lakeside wastewater treatment plant in South Haven, Michigan, as well as two wastewater facilities in Manitowoc and Two Rivers in Wisconsin. Areas of the Alliant Edgewater coal plant and its ash ponds in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, may also be vulnerable to flood waters, the report said.

How climate change and environmental justice are inextricably linked,"Placeholder while article actions load

Rhiana Gunn-Wright, 32, is one of the architects of the Green New Deal and the director of climate policy at the Roosevelt Institute, a New York-based think tank. She lives in Chicago with her husband and son. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight It’s probably best for us to begin with definitions of climate justice and environmental justice. Are those the same thing?

Climate justice is essentially about recognizing the fact that the climate crisis disproportionately affects people who are low-income, especially Black, Brown and Indigenous folks. They are also the folks who are going to have the fewest resources to cope with the changes that the climate crisis brings — whether that means not having the means to relocate if they are in a place that is heavily impacted, not having the money to install solar panels on a home, not having the means to pay for increased heating or cooling costs.

Environmental justice is about the ways that the built environment has been created and carved up in ways that expose Black, Brown and Indigenous folks to more pollution, more toxic sites, more chemicals in water supplies. Putting them close to abandoned mines or where oil drilling happens. The way that the built environment has been created to sort of cluster those harms that are all consequences of fossil fuel industries. Fossil fuels are poisonous. And that has to go somewhere. Legacies of systemic racism and residential segregation have been exploited to create those environments.

The interesting thing about air pollution, in particular, is you can’t even say low-income people of color because the fact is that even middle-income Black folks are exposed to more pollution than lower-income White folks. Income and class are not even mitigating factors the way that you’d think it would be. So environmental justice is very much about racism.

Is there some assumption that these communities are not aware of this, if even middle-income Black communities are close to toxic areas?

Advertisement

Some of it is about awareness, particularly if the pollution is coming from just the way the built environment is — you’re next to a highway or you’re next to a transit depot, or you live on a major street where there are lots of trucks. They’re attached to pollution, but it’s not as though it’s screamed from the rooftops.

The thing they take more advantage of is the histories of residential segregation and housing discrimination. Middle-income Black folks are more likely to live in neighborhoods with higher poverty levels because of racial segregation. And those areas are more likely to be zoned for industrial use. So you have legacies of red lining that have crowded people of color into one area, and then that area is more likely to be zoned industrial, so it’s cheaper to locate these facilities there. Or you’re next to a highway, so the home values are lower, so it’s harder to move out of these places. All of these things make these areas more vulnerable.

These are the things that have to happen in an economy that is reliant on fossil fuels. The factories have to be built. The oil refineries have to be somewhere. The trucks have to run somewhere. The highways have to be somewhere. All of which has a negative impact on public health. All of which on some level is poisonous. And so who is going to be listened to the least when they are poisoned? Who can be harmed without consequence? Who is least likely to be believed when they say, “My kid has asthma” or “My daughter has mysterious breast cancer”? Whose lives are socially treated as less valuable? People of color.

And “power” seems like an important word.

One hundred percent.

Many predominantly White communities have often been effective at protecting their neighborhoods.

Front-line communities, disadvantaged communities, those that are the most affected by environmental justice, it’s not as though they aren’t doing anything. A lot of these communities are highly organized; these folks are having to fight for decades, find partners, get outside funding to run campaigns, partner with local universities, all sorts of things. I saw it firsthand living in Detroit. The scale of what it required for them to say, “We don’t want this here. Stop it,” is just leagues above areas where residents have more power. Not even comparable. But for them to be heard, it takes megaphones on top of megaphones. What it means to be highly motivated in these situations is just so different. You’re talking about running a campaign vs. getting everyone to sign a petition.

Advertisement

You talk about how you can’t really understand environmental justice without understanding racism and its impact — these issues that you are dealing with are the manifestation of racism.

Yes! Yes!

So then, this is how it shows up. Racism doesn’t necessarily show up as someone calling you the n-word. It shows up in how a district is zoned or what they are willing to put in your neighborhood. This is the evidence.

One hundred percent. It’s the evidence. It’s the manifestation. This is the form that it takes.

So, thinking about the urgency around environmental issues: Conflating environmental issues and racism, does that help or hurt the environmental issues, in general?

Yeah, that’s a question I got a lot with the Green New Deal. People would ask me, “Why are you talking about race so much? Why does that matter?” Some people might disagree, but I truly believe, when describing the fossil fuel industry — and I think that all the evidence shows — it is not possible to burn fossil fuels at the rate that we have without limit, if there is not racism involved, because you have to have people who you can poison almost without consequence.

Advertisement

And so, with that in mind, you cannot address climate change if you are not also going to address environmental justice and climate justice. Because otherwise you are just leaving in place essentially the landscape that can again be exploited. You’ll have this happen again. You are still leaving the tracks for the next crisis to come.

How do you factor low-income White communities in this?

They are also considered front-line environmental justice communities, and even though the dynamics are different, in terms of racialized residential segregation, some of the others [issues] are the same. Low-income communities being exploited. Fossil fuel corporations have preyed on them, and transitioning to a green economy means doing justice for those communities, too. The question of racism is different because some of the factors at play are different, but the outcome is the same. The economic power has to be shifted in order to serve those communities well and to reduce emissions there and to get them out of harm’s way.

Advertisement

Are Black and Brown communities engaged in these conversations at the levels you think are necessary?

I would say no, but I think no constituency is on the level that is necessary around the environment. I’ll be honest: Environmental policy always seemed very “White” to me. I was doing social policy. I was interested in serving the people who I had grown up with, and I thought [environmental policy] was about polar bears and solar panels. I didn’t know how to talk about this when caseworkers are over-policing Black moms or people aren’t getting their welfare benefits. It was only after being in Detroit that things started to click. How the issues that I care about are connected, and how environmental justice had likely affected my own life. I have asthma. I grew up thinking that asthma was a childhood disease because so many kids around me had it. It wasn’t until I got older that I realized I lived in an area where air pollution is far more than what is acceptable.

I feel like people aren’t engaged on a large scale because we haven’t really been talking about the environment in the right ways. We live in a country where people are most concerned about: How do I put food on the table? How do I get my kids child care? How do I pay these bills? So you’re not talking about climate in a way where that’s accessible. We’re not talking about how switching to renewable energy will actually make energy a lot cheaper because prices will be a lot more stable. You won’t have to deal with gas prices fluctuating all the time because you won’t need gasoline. You don’t have to find oil and burn it. Once you install the solar panels the sun just keeps on shining. If you aren’t breaking that down for people, why would they care?

Advertisement

As one of the architects of the Green New Deal, you’ve contributed to the national conversation on the environment. That has to be encouraging for you.

It does and it doesn’t. One, because it happened so fast. When I started [working in] policy, I thought I would be lucky if anything I worked on took hold — ever. Because I worked around people who worked on issues, like paid leave, for decades, and we still don’t have paid leave. So I thought: I’m just going to slog it out on some stuff, and maybe it will happen and maybe it won’t. And for the Green New Deal to have had the impact that it did, I’m still processing that because it’s nothing that I expected in my wildest dreams.

I feel that time is showing that we were pretty correct around the things we said. This last [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report basically came out and said the world must do a green new deal. So that’s encouraging, but at the end of the day, even now, it just feels like we were ass-whupped a lot. I remember having the president of the United States at the time say it’s stupid. It wasn’t, and still isn’t easy. Until I actually see these things happening in law, changing the conversation feels great, but that’s ultimately not all that I am in it for.

Next step in combating climate change? Massive batteries that harness the power of the sun.,"Next step in combating climate change? Massive batteries that harness the power of the sun.

Show Caption Hide Caption Battery Market Comes of Age April 5 -- As technology has advanced and costs have come down, storage systems are being integrated into commercial and industrial facilities as a way to bring down costs while helping utility companies stabilize the grid at peak times. Bloomberg's Bloomberg

MOSS LANDING, Calif. – Less than a mile from a sea otter-filled estuary popular with kayakers sit row upon row of tall, steel white cabinets perched on low concrete platforms, the space between them crisscrossed with gravel paths. All is quiet save for the faint occasional hum of fans and the cawing of seagulls overhead.

A passerby might mistake the place for a self-storage facility, but old furniture and keepsakes aren't kept here. The energy of the sun is.

All day long, electricity from solar arrays pours into the California electric grid, too much to be used in daylight hours when demand is lower. The excess is stored here, at Pacific Gas & Electric's 182.5-megawatt Moss Landing Elkhorn Battery System.

Once the site of the state's largest fossil fuel-fired power plant, Elkhorn is one of dozens of utility-scale lithium-ion battery systems around the country that feed renewable energy back to the grid when it's needed.

""This is a future beyond fossil fuels, a future of clean air and a stable climate,"" said David Hochschild, chair of the California Energy Commission.

Called utility-grade batteries, Elkhorn's rows of white boxes can hold solar power for up to four hours. That helps cover the crucial window when the sun goes down, just as tens of millions of Californians come home, turn on their air conditioners and fire up their stoves to make dinner, a period called ""the evening ramp.""

Fully charged, the Elkhorn facility holds enough electricity for the instantaneous demands of PG&E customers in nearly 275,000 homes.

The storage allows the utility to avoid sourcing power from more expensive natural gas power plants needed only for peak demand. Just 10 days after the battery system was certified for operation, on April 17, it proved its worth.

""We were filling the batteries at a cost of $10 per megawatt hour. When we began to use that power at peak, it was worth $100 per megawatt hour,"" PG&E CEO Patti Poppe told a crowd at last week's unveiling of the system.

Over the course of this and last year, PG&E commissioned six large facilities in the state that together have the capacity to store nearly 1,000 megawatts of energy. It has contracts for another 2,374.5 megawatts through 2024.

PG&E also pulls power from an installation next door to Elkhorn owned by Vistra Corp. of Texas. It has a capacity of 400 megawatts and is scheduled to add another 350 megawatts in the coming years.

Last year California installed more than 2 gigawatts of battery storage, said Hochschild, and now has more than anywhere else in the world.

""It's an incredible success story,"" he said. ""Clearly, we've entered a golden age of energy storage.""

Storage is happening everywhere

Such battery sites are not unique to California. Eight states have set goals for energy storage to balance out wind- and solar-generated power, according to the American Clean Power Association, and more are expected to do the same as prices fall.

Without the ability to store energy, solar power isn't as useful as it might be. And as more renewable energy is added to the nation's electric grid the need for storage is growing.

In Oregon, the Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility, owned by Portland General Electric, features a 30-megawatt battery set connected to a 350-megawatt wind and solar installation.

Florida Power & Light Company is building a 409-megawatt solar-powered battery storage facility, ""enough to power Disney World for approximately seven hours,"" the company said.

The battery facility, under construction at the Manatee Energy Storage Center in Parrish, Florida, has enough capacity to power approximately 329,000 homes for more than two hours and is equivalent to 100 million iPhone batteries.

New York state this month announced six paired solar and battery storage projects that will store 159 megawatts of electricity.

Together, these facilities mean hundreds of thousands of homes that won't need power from a natural gas power plant for that peak period when the sun goes down.

""The battery can replace that,"" Paul Denholm, an energy analyst with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado.

A typical house uses about 1.25 kilowatts of electricity per hour on average, said Jason Burwen, vice president of energy storage with the American Clean Power Association.

A 1-megawatt battery can power about 330 homes, and many batteries being installed have four hours of energy, enough to carry those homes through the periods of peak demand, said Denholm.

These kinds of hybrid solar-battery plants may be one of the most important power trends of the 2020s, said Joachim Seel, a scientific engineering associate in the electricity markets and policy department of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Almost half of the nation's planned solar installations, totaling 675 gigawatts, are being proposed as part of a solar battery hybrid, he said.

The challenges of renewable energy

A common argument against using renewable power is that the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow when electricity is needed. Without storage, renewable energy can supply only about 50% of the nation's energy needs.

Add battery storage to the grid and it's suddenly possible to imagine getting 80% or 90% of the nation's power from carbon-free sources such as wind, solar, nuclear and hydroelectric, Denholm said.

But storage is only one piece of the puzzle, he acknowledged. To get to that 80% or 90%, the U.S. power grid must be modernized so it can easily move power from where it's stored to where it's needed. By some estimates, the electricity transmission system needs to expand 60% within the next decade.

Other roadblocks loom. Building enough storage capacity will mean overcoming supply chain delays and coping with rising prices for raw materials like the nickel, cobalt and lithium used to create the batteries.

The Elkhorn batteries were made by Tesla, which has factories in California and Nevada. But most utility-sized batteries come from Korea, Japan and China. COVID-19 lockdowns there have slowed production and tangled shipping.

The U.S. is working to shift production here, but it will take time. Last month the Biden administration announced a $3 billion investment in battery manufacturing and recycling facilities to boost the domestic supply chain.

Another concern is that under the wrong conditions, lithium-ion batteries can overheat and cause fires.

Vistra's Moss Landing facility has had two such incidents, one in February and one last September. A failed bearing in an air handling unit produced smoke that set off the sprinkler system. The water damaged the batteries, causing some to overheat, which created more smoke and released more water. Roughly 7% of the modules were destroyed, the company said in a report about the incident.

No one was injured in either instance, but the facility was shut down after the February incident. The company says it plans to bring it back online by the end of the summer.

A fire at a utility-scale battery installation in Arizona in April also shut it down for several months.

No energy system is entirely safe, advocates point out. In 2017, heavy rains overloaded California's Oroville dam, requiring 180,000 people to be evacuated while the foundation erosion was repaired. In 1979, Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear plant suffered a partial meltdown.

There were 680 serious incidents in natural gas, hazardous liquid and liquefied natural gas pipelines between 2002 and 2021, with 260 fatalities and 1,109 injuries, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

The future of energy storage

Today, about six gigawatts of battery storage is in place across the United States, and another 14 gigawatts-worth of projects are in the pipeline, said John Hensley, vice president of research at the American Clean Power Association.

By the end of the decade, it's estimated there will be enough batteries on the national grid to hold 75 gigawatts of renewable energy. That's enough electricity to power almost 50 million homes for an hour – or to run air conditioners in 38 million homes after the sun has gone down, said Denholm.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates storage capacity could grow to as much as 650 gigawatts by 2050 with costs expected to drop by as much as 88%. In the last decade they've already dropped more than 90%.

""These projects are getting built because they're economical,"" Denholm said. ""This is not being driven by policymakers saying, 'You need to build storage.' It's being driven by modeling that shows utilities this is the most economical resource.""

When the energy transition is complete, the lights will go on just as they always did but the electricity that powers them will come from different places than it does today.

With a more nimble power grid, excess power in one area can immediately go to where it's needed, with batteries filling in the gaps, Burwen said.

""Just because the sun's going down in Utah, it's still shining in California,"" he said. ""And when the sun goes down in California, the wind is roaring in the Great Plains.""",,[],['Elizabeth Weise']
Our brains are simply wired to ignore climate change,"On 3 August 2016, an Emirates aircraft on a flight from Thiruvananthapuram with 282 passengers on board caught fire after landing at Dubai International airport. The cabin crew asked all passengers to evacuate to safety immediately. But how did people react to this emergency? Surprisingly, there was no panic aboard the plane. Voices were even heard ‘reassuring’ others that there was nothing to worry about. Instead of rushing to the nearest exit and heading for an escape chute, many on board were more focused on opening overhead cabinets to take their cabin bags and laptops along. This lackadaisical behaviour in the face of imminent danger ended only after a flight attendant raised her voice asking passengers to evacuate the plane right away. But the crucial question is: Why were they more bothered about their belongings than lives?

Much like the individuals on that Emirates flight, all of us living on planet Earth are in the throes of imminent danger. Many eminent and knowledgeable persons have warned us about global warming and the catastrophes that will ensue. But like those unalarmed passengers, the residents of our planet, even those who might be the first to get affected by climate change, seem unbothered about its potential perils.

According to experts, when the planet’s temperatures increase, one of the first land masses to go under sea water will be the Kiribati islands in the Pacific Ocean. There are about 110,000 inhabitants on those islands. The danger is so pressing that the local government has bought 6,000 acres of land on the Fiji islands nearby to move the local population as and when their home islands get inundated. Yet, when a The New York Times reporter visited Kiribati, he found local residents, the very people on this globe whose lives would be endangered first by global warming, were not at all concerned about the problem. Their president Taneti Maamau had said this at the last United Nations Climate Change Conference: “We don’t believe that Kiribati will sink like the Titanic ship. Our country, our beautiful lands, are created by the hands of God.""

Why are humans so nonchalant in front of imminent danger? In the answer to this lies the fate of all the talk and awareness campaigns organized around the world in favour of achieving a more sustainable planet.

Sustainability is about preventing the depletion of natural or physical resources, so that they will remain available for the long term. But thinking about the future, more so the long term, is not in human nature. For millions of years, while roaming the savannas, our forefathers lived for the day. It is only with the introduction of agriculture that humans started of thinking of tomorrow, the future. But 10,000 years of thinking of a future crop is too short a time to make a dent in what millions of years of evolution have etched in the brain. Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, one of the foremost experts on the irrational nature of human beings, once said, “Sustainability requires people to accept certain short-term costs and reductions in their living standards in order to mitigate against higher but uncertain loses that are far in the future. This is exceptionally hard for people to accept.""

There is a common belief that natural disasters are a great opportunity to teach humans about the consequences of climate change. First of all, even experts struggle to explain a causative relationship between natural disasters and global warming. So expecting ordinary humans to draw a correlation between natural disasters and slowly rising temperatures is a difficult task.

When a natural disaster happens, the pain and loss of the event creates an immediate desire in the minds of people for normalcy to return. During these recovery times, it is difficult to make people believe that larger disasters are under way. So extreme weather events are unlikely to result in much positive behaviour in favour of sustainability.

In his book, Don’t Even Think About It: Why our Brains are Wired to Ignore Climate Change, George Marshall reminds us that the human brain is disposed to an optimism bias and not geared to react to risks that are invisible, even more so risks that are in the future. Expecting individuals to be champions of sustainable behaviour will therefore be a non-starter. The main responsibility for building a sustainable world should be taken up by governments and companies. It is easy to govern the behaviour of these through policy decisions and appropriate legislation. The actions of governments and corporates can help create new social norms, and it is easier to guide individual behaviour once strong social norms are formed.

The actual contribution of each individual’s behaviour towards a sustainable future might be too insignificant to talk about. But if these small acts can be portrayed as signifiers or badges of a higher-order social identity that any individual can acquire, the rewards become emotional in nature. Emotional rewards are always better initiators of new behaviours. These emotional rewards that accrue to people, that too in the present rather than distant future, will go a long way in fostering sustainable behaviour habits.

The human sensory system is usually very efficient in detecting any potential threat. But, unfortunately, climate change contains none of the clear signals that are required to mobilize our inbuilt response mechanisms to a threat. So human brains have a tendency to ignore threats like global warming. To build a sustainable world, we have to get around this significant biological barrier.

Australia Has Finally Woken Up to Climate Change,"First came the drought. Then the bushfires. Then the floods. And then, on May 21, 2022, came the federal election. After nearly four years as Australian prime minister—a term in office marked by repeated and record-breaking natural disasters—the conservative Scott Morrison was ousted following a contest that hinged on climate change.

“It’s a very clear illustration of the concern that Australians have and their desire for climate action,” says Amanda McKenzie, CEO of the Climate Council, a nonprofit organization dedicated to climate change communication. The hope is that the new Labor government will quickly improve Australia’s poor track record on carbon emissions.

Australia certainly has a lot of catching up to do. Its efforts to mitigate climate change have been declared “highly insufficient” by the Climate Action Tracker, an independent project that assesses countries’ climate policies. Despite ranking 55th in the world in population, Australia is the 14th-highest emitter of carbon dioxide—and the fifth highest if its large fossil fuel exports are factored in. It is the world’s second-largest exporter of coal. On a per capita basis, the country is one of the highest emitters of CO 2 in the world.

The election delivered a mixed result—but one that could help change this. New prime minister Anthony Albanese’s center-left Labor Party gained the most seats in Parliament—far more than the incumbent coalition of the center-right Liberal Party and National Party, which took power in 2013. But it wasn’t a landslide, with Labor exceeding the number of seats needed to govern in its own right by just one.

The surprise twist was the election of five new “teal” independents—so-called because of their campaign color. These candidates all ran on a platform of substantially stronger action on climate change than Labor, which in turn promised far more action on climate change than the coalition. Many teal independents won in previously secure Liberal Party electorates. The Australian Greens, who have the strongest climate policies of all the parties, also increased their electoral share from one to four seats in the lower house.

Prior to the election, the Australian government had maintained a commitment to a 26 to 28 percent decrease in emissions by 2030 under the Paris Agreement, which was compatible with around 3 degrees Celsius of warming. Labor went into the election with a range of climate and energy promises, including a commitment to a 43 percent reduction in emissions, which McKenzie says is “certainly not enough.” Analysis suggests this is still consistent with 2 degrees of warming. The teal candidates’ platforms aim for a 60 percent reduction, and the Greens’ for a 74 percent decrease. “Our analysis from a scientific perspective is it needs to be a 75 percent reduction this decade,” McKenzie says.

The hope is that the climate-focused independent and Green presence in Parliament will push Labor towards even greater climate action, says Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate and Energy Policy at Australian National University in Canberra. “For the government, this should mean a license to do more rather than less on climate change.”",,[],"['Condé Nast', 'Bianca Nogrady']"
The world’s largest trees are struggling to survive climate change,"Placeholder while article actions load

They are the largest trees in the world, living monuments with massive trunks and towering canopies that can thrive for 3,000 years. But ancient sequoia trees, which have been decimated by severe wildfires around California’s Sierra Nevada, are struggling to keep up with ever worsening conditions. And this summer, they could face their worst fate yet.

So far, 2022 has been the driest year on record in California in at least 125 years.

The trees, which grow in a narrow band of the Sierra Nevada, are accustomed to frequent wildfires — their tree rings show fire recurring every six to 30 years. But the worsening intensity of recent blazes have been too much for them to handle. Since 2020, three fires have resulted in the loss of 13 to 19 percent of the entire population, said Christy Brigham, chief of resources management and science at Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks.

In August 2020, the Castle Fire killed up to 10,600 trees. And as many as 3,637 sequoias were killed or will ultimately die as a result of the September 2021 Windy and KNP Complex fires in the southern Sierra Nevada, according to the National Park Service.

While fires at lower intensity have beneficial effects for the giant trees by clearing out the flammable vegetation and helping to release seeds from their sturdy cones, Brigham said the main concern is the “large patches of high-severity fire.”

“The scale at which we are seeing high-severity fire right now — sequoias haven’t evolved with that,” said Linnea Hardlund, a giant sequoia forest fellow with Save the Redwoods League. “It continues to be surprising to a lot of people that giant sequoias are dying at this rate.”

Sequoias have thick bark that can withstand lower-intensity fire, and their high canopies are usually above the flames, Hardlund said. But recent fires are reaching and consuming the canopy.

“Mass fires”

The southern Sierra, hard hit during the 2012-2016 drought, has become an epicenter for tree mortality. Drought-weakened trees, particularly pine and cedar, were killed by insects during those years, and the effects of the past two years of extreme drought are also becoming apparent.

Given record-setting dryness in 2022, another significant die-off is possible this year.

“We are starting to see rapid mortality and elevated mortality again, especially in pines,” Brigham said.

Research has linked severe burning to swaths of overly dense forest — a legacy of decades of firefighting — and high tree mortality, both of which have helped to drive “mass fires” and firestorms.

Hardlund, who is also a graduate student at University of California at Berkeley, said changes in fuel, weather and climate conditions are leading to changes in observed fire behavior.

“When you don’t have any fire history in the last century, you have 100 years of fuel buildup,” she said. As a result, forests have an abundance of smaller trees, where fires can start before spreading to mature trees.

Hotter and longer fire seasons due to climate change are exacerbating already volatile forest conditions. As climate warms, forests are becoming more flammable and increasingly dense due to a lack of what experts call “good fire,” which can reduce fire fuels while maintaining forest health, such as the intentional burning used by Indigenous tribes for thousands of years.

Add a tremendous amount of dead and down material from the 21st-century megadrought and you have the ingredients for extreme fires that can burn for weeks and form pyrocumulus clouds, billowing vertical smoke clouds that indicate a fire is burning unusually hot as it consumes a forest. These intense blazes are capable of damaging or killing trees that have historically thrived with frequent fire.

The dice are loaded again this year

Now in a third year of drought, Sierra forests and giant sequoias face similar threats this summer.

Paltry snowpack melted out early this year, reaching zero percent in the southern Sierra on May 24 — just two days later than last year. The first five months of 2022 were the driest on record for California, according to data from NOAA. Parts of the central and southern Sierra are now in exceptional drought, the most severe category. The 2021-22 water year has been the third-driest on record in the southern Sierra, behind 2020-21 and 1976-77.

The dice are loaded for a well-above-normal wildfire season in the West, including in California, said Ronnie Abolafia-Rosenzweig, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.

In a recent study, Abolafia-Rosenzweig and his co-authors found that winter and spring climate is strongly related to summer wildfire activity and to increases in burned area over the past four decades in the western United States. Previous research has linked those increases to human-caused climate change.

“We found that spring snowpack modulates how dry and hot summers are, where early snow disappearance favors hotter and drier summers,” he said.

Summer heat, in turn, is supercharging wildfires. This year, the Sierra are “likely to have dry conditions in late summer that enable large and fast-growing wildfires,” Abolafia-Rosenzweig said.

That could signal a risky season for the gigantic trees.

The Save the Redwoods League has called for emergency measures to protect sequoia groves from further destruction, in addition to long-term policy changes. The group is pushing to treat 2,000 acres of the most-at-risk groves before the 2023 fire season to remove unnatural vegetation buildup, including with carefully planned prescribed burning.

“Both the land cover and the climate are factors — and we have control over both,” Abolafia-Rosenzweig said. “We’re able to consider how both relate to growing fire risks and manage both accordingly.”

A Force of Nature: Hurricanes in a Changing Climate – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet,"Two hurricanes and two tropical storms in the Atlantic basin on September 4, 2019 as seen from the GOES-16 satellite. Credit: NASA/Joshua Stevens

In Brief: Due to global warming, global climate models predict hurricanes will likely cause more intense rainfall and have an increased coastal flood risk due to higher storm surge caused by rising seas. Additionally, the global frequency of storms may decrease or remain unchanged, but hurricanes that form are more likely to become intense.

From June 1 to November 30, many Americans turn their eyes to the tropics — not just because they’re dreaming of beach vacations, but because it’s hurricane season. Called by many names depending on where you live (hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones), scientists call these storms tropical cyclones. This is because they are large, rotating storms that need tropical conditions to form — so they originate mostly in the tropics.

Note: Technically, hurricanes are tropical cyclones that have winds of more than 74 miles per hour (about 120 kilometers per hour). However, “hurricanes” will be used as a general term in this article to include tropical storms, which are tropical cyclones below hurricane intensity.

With that said, let’s talk about some science behind hurricanes and how they may change due to global warming.

Recipe for a Hurricane

What is vertical wind shear? This term refers to the change in wind speed and/or direction as you travel upwards in the atmosphere. Why does this matter for a hurricane? Think of the center of a hurricane as a tower of blocks that you push with your hands. If you push the top and bottom in the same direction and with the same strength, the tower can stay intact as it moves along the floor (i.e., low vertical wind shear). If you push the top and bottom in different directions or with different levels of strength, the tower will topple (i.e., high vertical wind shear). Similarly, hurricanes get pulled apart in high vertical wind shear, making it hard for them to grow and strengthen.

Hurricanes need four main ingredients to form and strengthen:

warm ocean water

lots of moisture in the air

low vertical wind shear

a pre-existing disturbance (e.g., a cluster of thunderstorms)

Just like making a perfect cookie, a hurricane needs all the ingredients for it to grow. Change any ingredient too much and the cookie will be too flat, too dry, too crumbly, etc. The same is true for hurricanes: If any of the four main ingredients changes too much, the storm cannot form or will weaken.

Once a hurricane forms, scientists shift their focus to where it is going and how strong it will be when it gets there. Where a hurricane goes depends mainly on the large-scale weather patterns around it at the time. If it moves over land, it brings with it a fury of strong wind, drenching rain, dangerous storm surge and sometimes tornadoes.

With so many moving parts, forecasting a hurricane is hard. Large-scale changes in the climate, such as El Niño and La Niña conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean, also impact hurricanes over an entire season. Thus, trying to determine how climate change will impact hurricanes may seem like an impossible task. However, important tools are in place to help scientists tackle it. These include sophisticated global climate models, scientific understanding of how hurricanes form and evolve, and expanding observational records of past hurricane activity.

What Do the Models Show?

Tom Knutson, senior scientist at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, is a leading scientist on hurricanes and climate change. He notes that “even if hurricanes themselves don’t change [due to climate change], the flooding from storm surge events will be made worse by sea level rise.” In addition, he says models show increases in a hurricane’s rainfall rate by 2100. This means that hurricanes are likely to cause more intense rain when they come ashore.

Scientists have long predicted that climate change would increase extreme rainfall events. In a warmer world, there is simply more moisture in the air in the form of gaseous water vapor. Think of heating up a pot of water on the stove. Once the liquid water becomes hot enough, it boils and creates steam (or hot water vapor). This process is called “evaporation,” or when a liquid changes to a gas.

A similar process happens at Earth’s surface. As surface temperatures rise, more liquid water evaporates from the land and ocean. Evaporation adds moisture to the air. How much water vapor the air can hold is based on its temperature. Warmer air temperatures can hold more water vapor. The increased moisture in the air leads to more intense rainfall, especially during extreme events.

In a hurricane, spiraling winds draw moist air toward the center, fueling the towering thunderstorms that surround it. As the air continues to warm due to climate change, hurricanes can hold more water vapor, producing more intense rainfall rates in a storm.

Moreover, according to Knutson, most models show that climate change brings a slight increase in hurricane wind intensity. This change is likely related to warming ocean temperatures and more moisture in the air, both of which fuel hurricanes. While most models show either no change or a decrease in hurricane frequency in a warmer climate, a greater proportion of the storms that form will reach very intense (Category 4 or 5) levels. In other words, while there may be fewer storms, the ones that form have a greater chance of becoming stronger.

Scientists continue to research these topics along with other important hurricane metrics, including any potential changes in the speed at which hurricanes move across the ocean, how large storms will get, and where hurricanes will go.

What Do Observations Show?

Climate models that help us understand future changes are a key part to the story, but have any changes in hurricane activity already been observed in recent years?

Since the 1980s, the hurricane record has shown a more active period in the North Atlantic Ocean. On average, there have been more storms, stronger hurricanes, and an increase in hurricanes that rapidly intensify. Thus far, most of these increases are from natural climate variations. However, one recent study suggests that the latest increase in the proportion of North Atlantic hurricanes undergoing rapid intensification is a bit too large to be explained by natural variability alone. This could be the beginning of detecting the impact of climate change on hurricanes, the paper states. In contrast, the frequency of hurricanes making U.S. landfall (a subset of North Atlantic hurricanes) has not increased since 1900, despite significant global warming and the heating of the tropical Atlantic Ocean.

One current focus of hurricane research is “sampling hurricanes by flying into them for more accurate data,” says Shirley Murillo, deputy director of NOAA’s Hurricane Research Division. These higher-quality data are important for improving hurricane model forecasts now and in the future. NOAA partners with NASA to collect measurements of various aspects of hurricanes over time. “NASA weather satellites are a powerful tool for observations, as people cannot fly into every storm to gather data,” Murillo says. Satellites help expand the observational record. With a longer, more detailed record, scientists can detect changes in long-term data trends over time.

This partnership is also developing the next generation of satellites to further improve hurricane observations for models. Dr. Marangelly Fuentes, meteorologist and program manager for one of NASA’s Earth research contracts, says researchers “run tests with potential new data to see how they would impact the model’s ability to correctly forecast a hurricane.”

For example, researchers may test to see if more detailed data about the ocean’s surface temperature in front of a storm help to accurately predict its intensity. If they find something useful, they can use this information to inform the design of instruments on future satellites. Then as more data are collected, this will lead to a better understanding of forecasting hurricanes and how they may be impacted by climate change.

What Does That Mean for Me?

Anyone who has experienced a hurricane knows how much damage it can cause to life and property. Flooding remains one of the biggest concerns when a hurricane comes ashore, and climate change will likely make that worse. With impacts from climate change (like sea level rise) already happening, the likelihood of a billion-dollar disaster from a hurricane remains very high.

If you live in hurricane-threatened areas, the best thing you can do is to be prepared. As we collect more data about hurricanes, we’ll better understand whether models correctly predicted hurricane changes from human-caused global warming. Fuentes says, “All of us have to do our part when seeing changes on the Earth, like the recent pattern of stronger hurricanes, to avoid it becoming something permanent.”

"‘Space bubbles’ between Earth, sun possibly could reverse destructive climate change, MIT researchers say","It’s too late to stop catastrophic climate change, many people fear. Frequent extreme heat waves, droughts and floods: these are already happening, and most climate experts say they’re likely to get worse.

But what if science and technology could provide a solution?

A group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology believes the “worst-case scenario” of a warming planet possibly could be avoided through human ingenuity – namely, the building of frozen “space bubbles” that would prevent some of the sun’s rays from reaching Earth.

“While addressing climate change necessarily requires lowering CO2 emission on the Earth, other approaches such as geo-engineering could supplement such efforts if current mitigation and adaptation measures turned out to be inadequate for reversing the ongoing climate change trends,” the team wrote in May. “In particular, solar geo-engineering – a set of technologies aiming to reflect a fraction of sunlight coming to the Earth – has been theoretically proved to be a valuable solution for supplementing current efforts for CO2 emission reductions.”

The solar geo-engineering idea this team is advancing involves a “raft” of thin, inflatable shields, collectively about the size of Brazil, made of silicon-like materials. They would be constructed in outer space close to the Lagrangian Point – the point where the gravitational forces of the sun and Earth cancel each other out.

Shields are proposed to reflect sunlight. (Image: MIT Senseable City)

The team, which hopes to do more and larger-scale research, says they have successfully tested inflating a bubble shield in outer-space conditions. They argue on a website devoted to their work that “if we deflect 1.8% of incident solar radiation before it hits our planet, we could fully reverse today’s global warming.”

Climate geo-engineering is a contentious subject in the scientific community, for the various proposals could have disastrous unintended consequences. (Preventing some sunlight from reaching Earth, for example, could kill large swaths of crops.) But support for pursuing regulated international geo-engineering projects appears to be increasing.

Pascal Lamy, president of the Paris Peace Forum and the former World Trade Organization director general, recently said a “global effort on geo-engineering could work.”

One key benefit of the “space bubbles” approach, its proponents say, is that it would be reversible. The bubbles could be deflated and moved out of the Lagrangian Point.

Said MIT Senseable City Lab director and project leader Carlo Ratti:

“We believe that advancing feasibility studies of a solar shield to the next level could help us make more informed decisions in the years to come should geo-engineering approaches become urgent.”

"As climate change reshapes Alaska’s landscapes, tundra fires are getting worse","Apoon Pass Fire burns through the tundra June 11, 2022. The Apoon Pass fire is close to the East Fork Fire. (Photo by AFS/Ryan McPherson)

For weeks, wildfires have raged across Alaska’s vast Southwest region — threatening villages, burning up hundreds of thousands of acres and pushing smoke far across the state.

Fire on the Southwest Alaska tundra isn’t unheard of, but as climate change continues to reshape the state’s environment, tundra fires are becoming both more frequent and more severe.

The East Fork Fire, currently burning in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, is the largest fire on record in the area, having burned some 125,000 acres so far, according to Rick Thoman, a climate specialist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

And of the 700,000 acres burned in Alaska this fire season, most of that has been in the Southwest, said Zav Grabinski, a fire science communication specialist for the Alaska Fire Science Consortium.

That’s unusual since most of Alaska’s fires tend to burn in the state’s Interior boreal forests, between the Brooks Range and the Alaska Range.

The current fires in Southwest Alaska are burning on a landscape marked by permafrost and small vegetation, as well as a lack of trees, Grabinski said.

[Related: Firefighters make more headway against wildfire as winds push it away from Southwest Alaska villages]

Tundra fires have always happened, said Nancy Fresco, an associate research professor at the International Arctic Research Center within the University of Alaska Fairbanks, “but climate change is greatly increasing their frequency and severity.”

Historically, fires affecting the Southwest tundra were relatively small and infrequent, she said.

“The fires burning now really are unprecedented in that sense,” Fresco said.

That’s due to several factors. Statewide, Alaska is experiencing higher temperature trends that can cause drying, which in turn can spell more frequent and intense fires.

And on top of that, climate change is causing vegetation in the region to change. With warmer seasons, the soil thaws earlier, and different plants begin to grow there, Fresco said.

In some areas where once not-flammable lichen and moss grew, there might be more flammable grass and shrubs growing instead. So when lightning strikes, it’s more likely to lead to a fire, and a fire that spreads, she said.

Tundra environments are vastly different around the state — in Utqiagvik, there is nothing that grows taller than a person’s calf, while in the Southwest region, willow and alder thickets grow some 10-feet high, Thoman said.

Thoman also noted the western spread of the state’s boreal forest — meaning that over the long term, a tundra fire in Southwest Alaska may just be considered a forest fire, with warmer summers able to support tree growth.

[St. Mary’s residents pitch in to help protect their village from a historic tundra wildfire]

The trend of increasing tundra wildfires isn’t playing out the same around the state. Thoman said the increases are concentrated in tundra areas of Southwest Alaska and in the Noatak Valley, but the Seward Peninsula and North Slope aren’t showing the same uptick, though it’s not clear why.

While Fresco’s fire modeling can’t say where and when future fires will burn in a precise way, she said it points to more severe fire years, particularly in tundra areas.

“It’s extremely difficult to predict exactly when some of those more severe fire years might occur,” Fresco said. “But, certainly for tundra areas, the trend is towards greater risk of fire.”

Fresco said while it can be hard for people to look at research that predicts bad news, there’s a positive side: It empowers people to plan and to ask how communities can get ready, she said.

“It’s important to think about this statewide and to think how larger communities can help and support smaller communities in dealing with risk and then planning for risk,” Fresco said. “Because we’re all in this together.”",,[],['Morgan Krakow']
Is climate change causing this week's hot weather?,"A couple look out at the beach on June 15, 2022 in Weymouth. (Getty Images)

By the end of this week, parts of the UK will bake in temperatures of up to 34C, far hotter than normal June weather – but is climate change behind the soaring temperatures?

Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Dan Rudman, said: “Temperatures will continue to rise as we go through the week, becoming well above-average by Friday when many parts of the southern half of the UK are likely to exceed 30C and may even reach 34C in some places.”

“This is the first spell of hot weather this year and it is unusual for temperature to exceed these values in June.""

The Met Office says that the unseasonal warmth is due to ‘home-grown warming during the day’ due to high pressure, plus a southerly airflow which is bringing warm air from the continent to Britain.

This week’s temperature doesn’t – quite – qualify as a heatwave, the Met Office says, due to the short-lived nature of the hot temperatures.

But is climate change behind this week’s blistering temperatures?

Is climate change causing the UK heatwave?

Dr Mark McCarthy, who looks after UK climate records at the Met Office, has said that temperatures in England are getting warmer, and in some areas of England the rise is up to 1C.

McCarthy said: “A scientific study by the Met Office into the summer 2018 heatwave in the UK showed that it was 30 times more likely to occur now than in 1750 because of the higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.""

“As greenhouse gas concentrations increase, heatwaves of similar intensity are projected to become even more frequent, perhaps occurring as regularly as every other year.”

Read more: A 1988 warning about climate change was mostly right

Our warming climate meant that last year’s summer heatwave was 30 times more likely and, by mid-century, such summers could happen about 50% of the time.

The study, based on computer models, found that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is behind the rising temperatures, Met Office scientists said.

Story continues

Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit 416 parts per million last year, the Met Office said, compared to the pre-industrial era (before 1750), when the atmospheric concentration was about 280 parts per million.”

In 2018, Met Office scientist Dr Nikolaos Christidis who was ainvolved in the study said: “Our models show that there is now about a 12% chance of summer average temperatures being as high as the UK experienced in summer 2018. This compares with a less than half per cent chance we’d expect in a natural climate.”

Are heatwaves getting worse?

Other research has shown that climate change is linked to heatwaves and extreme weather events around the world.

Matt Williams, co-founder of Greenspark, which works with businesses to improve their environmental impact, said: “Extremely hot days are a natural part of our weather cycle, but recently we’re experiencing more intense heat waves at often unusual times in the year.

“These extreme weather events are becoming more common, and it’s expected that they will continue to become more frequent as time goes by.

“There is evidence to suggest that human activity is increasing the frequency and magnitude of these events. A great deal of evidence suggests that human behaviour is impacting the severity and frequency of heatwaves, flooding, wildfires and other extreme weather events.”

Read more: Why economists worry that reversing climate change is hopeless

Last year’s UN climate change report warned that extreme weather events like heatwaves and droughts which previously would have happened every 50 years could soon happen every four.

Speaking about the UN report, Dr Robert Rohde, lead scientist of Berkeley Earth, said: “What were once-in-50-year heat extremes are now occurring every 10 years.

“By a rise of two degrees celsius, those same extremes will occur every 3.5 years.”

The report found that (for example) once-in-a-decade heavy rain events are already 1.3 times more likely and 6.7% wetter, compared with the 50 years leading up to 1900 when human-driven warning began to occur.

Droughts that previously happened once a decade now happen every five or six years.

Xuebin Zhang, a climatologist with Environment Canada in Toronto, warned that as the world warms, such extreme weather events will not just become more frequent, they will become more severe.

Zhang said that the world should also expect more compound events, such as heat waves and long-term droughts occurring simultaneously.

Zhang said: “We are not going to be hit just by one thing, we are going to be hit by multiple things at the same time.”

What impact do heatwaves have on the planet?

Researchers at UCL warned in a recent study that heatwaves will have a direct impact on mortality in Britain.

Deaths directly related to temperature will soar by 42% if the world’s climate warms by 2C above pre-industrial levels, scientists have warned.

The rate of increase particularly speeds up at 2C of warming, with a much higher risk appearing beyond 2.5°C.

The researchers say that 3C warming could lead to a 75% increase in mortality risk during heatwaves.

Lead author Dr Katty Huang, from University College London's Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering team, said: ""The increase in mortality risk under current warming levels is mainly notable during heatwaves, but with further warming, we would see risk rise on average summer days in addition to escalating risks during heatwaves.

“What this means is that we shouldn't expect past trends of impact per degree of warming to apply in the future.

“One degree of global warming beyond 2C would have a much more severe impact on health in England and Wales than one degree warming from pre-industrial levels, with implications for how the NHS can cope.""

“The heat is a result of a mix of home-grown warming in the day due to high pressure, as well as a southerly airflow introducing some of the warm air from the continent to UK shores.”

"Facing 'existential threat' of climate change, potato processor asks farmers to do more for the environment","As the effects of climate change continue to impact the potato growing season, a major food processor is asking its growers to adopt more sustainable agriculture practices.

McCain Foods announced a new plan to incorporate regenerative agriculture practices on all of their potato fields worldwide by 2030. The Canadian company manufactures frozen french fries and appetizers, and has plants in Appleton, Plover and Rice Lake.

Potato farmers will be able to pick which practices to implement on their farm from the company’s new regenerative agriculture framework. The list includes covering soils with living plants, improving crop diversity, minimizing soil disturbance and reducing the impacts of chemicals.

Jess Newman, senior director of agriculture and sustainability for McCain Foods, said asking farmers to protect the environment was a simple choice after seeing the impacts of climate change amplified in recent years.

""Climate change is an existential threat to the potato industry. When we look across all the regions in the U.S. and Canada where McCain is working directly with potato farmers ... we see an increasing incidence of crop failures,"" Newman said. ""If we look specifically at Wisconsin, we're seeing large rains coming at strange times, cool early springtime temperatures, increasing pressure from humidity which we know drives pests and disease. It's getting more and more difficult to grow.""

She said McCain Foods is now planning for crop failures in some regions every two years — a devastating trend for farmers and a challenge for the company’s supply chain to manage.

Newman said the new framework likely won't mean a major overhaul for farmers. She said many growers in Wisconsin and other states have already implemented many of the more sustainable practices.

""Keeping living cover on soils, diversifying rotation so you only see a potato crop every one in four (years), moving toward fewer soil disturbance and tillage events, integrating livestock, trialing bio fumigation, these are all areas where growers in Wisconsin are leading,"" she said.

Sign up for daily news! Stay informed with WPR's email newsletter.

Newman said McCain also hopes to help ""de-risk"" testing new regenerative agriculture practices by helping fund on-farm trials and connecting farmers with financing through the U.S. Department of Agriculture or ag lenders.

Diane Mayerfeld is the sustainable agriculture coordinator for the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Division of Extension. She said regenerative agriculture has become increasingly popular in the last five years as farmers and food companies look for ways to differentiate themselves from the increasingly ambiguous term ""sustainable.""

""People who wanted to do that kind of work were frustrated by all the people who use sustainable to mean something very minimal. And so they've really focused on saying 'We don't want to just keep agriculture the way it is. We want agriculture to make things better.'"" Mayerfeld said.

But she said there is no legal definition for regenerative agriculture and that means companies can set their own standards for what the term means.

Looking at McCain Foods' plan, Mayerfeld said their beginner level standards aren’t what she would consider ambitious and include many practices that are standard for growers. And she points out there are several gray areas for how the standards should be implemented.

""I have some sympathy for whoever wrote this. You know, they're trying to put something on one page and there's a huge amount of variation in the specifics of what you can and cannot do, depending on the soils you're growing on, depending on the weather, depending on the pest species that you're dealing with,"" she said. ""Even within Wisconsin, the challenges and the practices are different between, say the Central Sands counties like Portage County, and then some of the counties where potatoes are grown on less sandy soils like Langlade County.""

Mayerfeld said McCain Foods' plan is mostly on par with the initiatives set by other major food manufacturers. But she said even if companies aren't committing to big changes in the short term, having more major players take the first step toward a more sustainable system is still a positive change.

""I do also think it's very important for consumers to keep up the pressure and I also think it's important for government to continue to create policy and enforce that policy to protect the public,"" Mayerfeld said. ""I think these commitments by companies can change company culture, and I think that can be hugely important and they can also motivate farmers to change their practices.""",,[],['Hope Kirwan']

Fish have ears to the ground on climate change: Why Pisces ears are a data mine,"Many models have been developed over the years to combat global warming and climate change , and scientists have come up with yet another solution that is expected to understand the environment and its evolution over time in a better manner. This time, scientists are focusing on aquatic endeavours spanning the east and west coasts of the Indian subcontinent, specifically by studying otoliths , also known as fish “ear stones,” which are pea-sized, pearly white, hard, calcium-carbonate structures found directly behind the brain of bony fishes. Otoliths are credited with helping the fish with hearing and balance, and they are the latest data-mine to extract information about the evolving environment.

Just as tree rings possess plentiful information about trees and the environment, otoliths show how a fish changes in response to the changes in the water’s condition. For instance, otoliths depict seasonal changes in their environment as alternating opaque and translucent rings. Combined with other sources of data, otoliths can show how practices in the fishery are being managed in response to human actions, as well.

The process includes drilling the bones to obtain a sample of carbonate powder. The powder is then placed in acid and allowed to react in a process known as acid digestion. This process releases carbon dioxide gas, and using analytical tools, the oxygen and carbon isotopes are analysed.

said. “We have employed a novel technique where a few millimetre-sized otoliths are analysed by a carbon dioxide laser at a few micron scale intervals to measure their oxygen isotopic compositions. The isotopes of oxygen in these otoliths depend on the temperature of the water in which the fish grew and therefore record continuous snapshots of past temperature during its lifetime of a few years,” Professor Anindya Sarkar, the lead investigator of the study who works in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at IIT Kharagpur

As a result, cycles of the summer-winter temperatures of the water in which the fish is living can be recorded because high and low temperatures can be noted through this scientific research. Since calcium carbonate forms the otolith material composition, carbon isotopes can be analysed, which in turn reveal the carbon cycle in the water. This also helps determine the productivity levels of the aquatic system, which could be either the transfer of energy or matter through the food web or the quantity of fish that could be captured in a sustainable way per unit of time.

“Taken together, the temperature and carbon data points give you a piece of very comprehensive climate information at any given time over the time the fish had been living,” Sarkar added.

In addition to providing climate data accurately and more rapidly than previous tests, this method allows researchers to study climate variations over smaller periods of time. Past records were available over a large scale of time, stretching over a thousand or million-year scale. This technique, however, allows for a monthly scale of climate study. This helps people understand the pollution-induced climate change of modern times, and global warming predictions can also be based on such models.

Alongside all of this, studying five-thousand-year-old fish otoliths from the Indus valley sites can reveal information about how these past civilizations grew and collapsed since people belonging to that time period and region included fish as a part of their diets.

“We are studying how the Indus Valley civilization evolved and declined, and if we are able to detect or trace the seasonal variation through the time, it will help the past climate modellers in a major way to understand the dynamics of these civilizations. We knew through our earlier studies that the monsoon and a global drought over a few thousand years played pivotal roles but we have no idea yet on how the climate system behaved over a seasonal scale,” Sarkar added.

While the study is hugely beneficial, there are limitations that scientists face to continue conducting their research. One of them is a limited number of researchers who work on studying fish otoliths. Another major limitation includes the extraction from the fish head, which ultimately requires sacrificing fish. Because of the limits placed on the usage of threatened fish, not many can be used for research purposes.

Similar studies are being conducted in other parts of the world, too. In Australia, researchers are analysing otoliths to reconstruct environment histories and comprehend climate variability and its impact on the country’s fish. They are also predicting ecological responses to ocean warming and climate change.",,[],['Times Now Exclusive']
"As climate change makes Philly temps rise, so does urgency to make schools cooler","When John Coats goes to work at Emlen Elementary School in East Mount Airy, the best way to teach addition and subtraction is not the only thing on his mind. He also has to worry about keeping his students cool.

Emlen is one of more than 100 schools in the School District of Philadelphia — or about 60% — that lack central air conditioning. Coats estimates just about a third of the classrooms at Emlen have functional window units, but his second-floor classroom is not one of them.

“It’s an old building built in 1925, so it maintains the heat,” he said. “When the sun hits it, it’s hotter in the building than it is outside.”

The building’s walls start to sweat, and floors become dangerously slippery, said Coats, who teaches math and is the school climate facilitator at Emlen. Teachers bring in fans and freeze pops. Coats is often forced to take his class outside and pivot to a different lesson, because he notices his sweltering 5 to 12-year-old students losing focus.

“They’re distracted,” he said. “You’re going to lose more than half your class.”

With aging facilities, the School District of Philadelphia is struggling to keep students cool and ready to learn in a warming world. Philadelphia public schools let out for the summer Tuesday, after a spring that brought historically hot temperatures to the city and ahead of a summer that’s expected to be an above-average scorcher. Late last month, schools sent students home early due to excessive heat — reminiscent of the rocky start to the school year in 2018, when the heat made students and teachers ill, and schools closed early multiple days.

Researchers have found a link between hotter temperatures and lower test scores, and that heat contributes to educational inequality. Across much of the country, schools are struggling to operate in increasingly hot weather.

Coats, a teacher of 36 years in the district and nine at Emlen Elementary School, said the issue of extreme heat in classrooms seems to be getting worse.

“It’s always been a problem, the climate of the building,” he said. But “it gets extremely hot now more than it used to.”

Will dirty EU deal with Israel really tackle climate change?,"Ursula von der Leyen (left) from the European Commission buddies up with Naftali Bennett, Israel’s prime minister. Amir Cohen UPI

Honorary doctorates sometimes get handed to the least honorable people.

This week the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev gave such an award to Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s head. Based on her acceptance speech, the only degree which von der Leyen really deserved was an “MD” – a master’s in deception.

Von der Leyen had the audacity to present cooperation with Israel as a step towards “decarbonizing our energy mix.”

So honored to receive an honorary doctorate from @bengurionu.

It would be foolish to trust von der Leyen’s assurances.

The companies taking part in the projects she praised include ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell. All of those firms profit from fossil fuels – the single largest cause of global warming.

Environmental destruction is indeed a huge enemy for humanity. But why would fossil fuel giants want to fight it?

Breaking free?

Von der Leyen portrayed energy cooperation with Israel as a way to “break free of our dependency on Russian fossil fuels.”

Not everyone is so enthusiastic. Victoria Nuland, a US State Department veteran, does not believe that the EastMed pipeline will allow Europe to find a replacement for Russian gas swiftly enough.

Nuland has long been determined to keep Brussels bureaucrats in their place.

Back in 2014, a recording was leaked of Nuland dictating whose opinion mattered about Ukraine. “Fuck the EU,” she said at that time.

Von der Leyen displays the kind of deference which Nuland demands. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the European Commission boss has stressed her “unity” with the US.

By groveling to Israel this week, von der Leyen will surely have pleased Joe Biden’s administration. Her comments involved the kind of duplicity that American politicians have got away with for way too long.

At Ben-Gurion University, she complained about “authoritarian regimes beyond our borders.” To avoid any doubt about which regime she was focusing on, von der Leyen then singled out Russia.

Selective

The EU and the US have a selective approach to authoritarian regimes. Authoritarian regimes which buy Western arms and humor Western businesses are regarded as valued partners.

As part of her trip, von der Leyen signed a trilateral agreement on energy cooperation between the EU, Egypt and Israel.

I am grateful that Israel will increase its supply of energy to the EU.



Tomorrow we’ll take an important step, with the signing of a trilateral agreement on gas between Israel, the EU and Egypt.



And we will join forces to help protect the world from a major food crisis. pic.twitter.com/N7DRWfj41K — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) June 14, 2022

Egypt plays an essential role in blockading Gaza, too, but that does not appear to have been on von der Leyen’s agenda.

Von der Leyen also paid a visit this week to Mohammed Shtayyeh from the Palestinian Authority, which detains and tortures Palestinians to keep Israel and the EU happy.

Shtayyeh patted von der Leyen on the back over Europe’s nominal commitment to the search for peace and justice.

Today I welcomed Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. We thank the EU for resuming its financial support to Palestine.

For the past year, the EU has withheld funding for Palestinian hospitals. There is nothing just about depriving cancer patients of treatment.

Although von der Leyen has trumpeted a decision allowing the funding to resume, she has never denounced – at least not publicly – the man who blocked the funding, Hungary’s EU commissioner Olivér Várhelyi. Her silence is inexcusable considering that she is Várhelyi’s boss and could exert considerable pressure on him if she so desired.

Cowardly

Palestinian rights barely got a mention from von der Leyen this week. The only notable exception was when she stated that the EU “strongly condemns” the killing of the journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.

As condemnations go, it was a cowardly one. Von der Leyen did not acknowledge that there was a clear culprit in this killing – the Israeli military.

Nor did von der Leyen say anything this week about the violence of the Israeli police during Abu Akleh’s funeral.

Von der Leyen has described aggression ordered by Vladimir Putin as “barbaric” and called Russia’s occupation of parts of Ukraine “terrifying.”

But she would never dare to use such strong words when alluding to Israel.

In her Ben-Gurion University speech, von der Leyen praised Israel as a “global trailblazer for science and innovation.”

Eager to embrace the “global trailblazer,” the EU gives research grants to Israel’s weapons industry and even a firm established by a former head of Mossad, the spying and assassination agency.

Von der Leyen did not draw attention to the murky aspects of the EU-Israel partnership this week. Rather, she advocated that the partnership should be put to use in the fight against climate change.

Once again, von der Leyen omitted some important details.

The Israel Electric Corporation is a major participant in the energy projects that von der Leyen endorsed. The same company is actively involved in Israel’s theft and colonization of the West Bank.

If the projects are completed, energy generated in settlements which violate international law will be imported into Europe.

New data reveals extraordinary global heating in the Arctic,"New data has revealed extraordinary rates of global heating in the Arctic, up to seven times faster than the global average.

The heating is occurring in the North Barents Sea, a region where fast rising temperatures are suspected to trigger increases in extreme weather in North America, Europe and Asia. The researchers said the heating in this region was an “early warning” of what could happen across the rest of the Arctic.

The new figures show annual average temperatures in the area are rising across the year by up to 2.7C a decade, with particularly high rises in the months of autumn of up to 4C a decade. This makes the North Barents Sea and its islands the fastest warming place known on Earth.

Recent years have seen temperatures far above average recorded in the Arctic, with seasoned observers describing the situation as “crazy”, “weird”, and “simply shocking”. Some climate scientists have warned the unprecedented events could signal faster and more abrupt climate breakdown.

It was already known that the climate crisis was driving heating across the Arctic three times faster than the global average, but the new research shows the situation is even more extreme in places.

Sea ice is good at reflecting sunlight but is melting away. This allows the darker ocean below to absorb more energy. Losing sea ice also means it no longer restricts the ability of warmer sea waters to heat up the Arctic air. The more ice is lost, the more heat accumulates, forming a feedback loop.

“We expected to see strong warming, but not on the scale we found,” said Ketil Isaksen, senior researched at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and who led the work. “We were all surprised. From what we know from all other observation points on the globe, these are the highest warming rates we have observed so far.”

“The broader message is that the feedback of melting sea ice is even higher than previously shown,” he said. “This is an early warning for what’s happening in the rest of the Arctic if this melting continues, and what is most likely to happen in the next decades.” The world’s scientists said in April that immediate and deep cuts to carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases are needed to tackle the climate emergency.

“This study shows that even the best possible models have been underestimating the rate of warming in the Barents Sea,” said Dr Ruth Mottram, climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute, and not part of the team. “We seem to be seeing it shifting to a new regime, as it becomes less like the Arctic and more like the North Atlantic. It’s really on the edge right now and it seems unlikely that sea ice will persist in this region for much longer.”

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, is based on data from automatic weather stations on the islands of Svalbard and Franz Josef Land. Until now, this had not been through the standard quality control process and made public.

The result was a high-quality set of surface air temperature measurements from 1981 to 2020. The researchers concluded: “The regional warming rate for the Northern Barents Sea region is exceptional and corresponds to 2 to 2.5 times the Arctic warming averages and 5 to 7 times the global warming averages.”

There was a very strong correlation over time between air temperature, sea ice loss and ocean temperature. Isaksen said the rapid temperature rise would have a very big impact on ecosystems: “For instance, here in Oslo, we have a temperature rise of 0.4C a decade and people really feel the disappearing snow conditions during winter. But what’s happening in the far north is off the scale.”

Isaksen said the new information on heating rates in the area would help research by other scientists on how changes in the Arctic affect extreme weather in populous areas at lower latitudes. There is evidence that the rapid heating changes the jet stream winds that encircle the pole and influence extreme weather.

“Sea ice loss and warming in the Barents Sea in particular have been isolated in previous work as being especially relevant to changes in winter-time atmospheric circulation that are tied to extreme winter weather events,” said Prof Michael Mann, from Pennsylvania State University, US. “If this mechanism is valid, and there’s some debate over that, then this is yet another way climate change could be increasing certain types of extreme weather events [and which] isn’t well captured by current models.”",,[],['Damian Carrington']
The 1977 White House climate memo that should have changed the world,"In 1977 Star Wars hit movie theaters, New York City had a blackout that lasted 25 hours, and the Apple II personal computer went up for sale. It was also the year that a remarkable one-page memo was circulated at the very highest levels of US government.

Years before the climate crisis was part of national discourse, this memo outlined what was known – and feared – about the crisis at the time. It was prescient in many ways. Did anyone listen?

By July 1977, President Jimmy Carter had only been in office for seven months, but he had already built a reputation for being focused on environmental issues. For one, by installing solar panels on the White House. He had also announced a national renewable energy plan .

“We must start now to develop the new, unconventional sources of energy we will rely on in the next century,” he said in an address to the nation outlining its main goals.

The climate memo arrived on his desk a few days after the Independence Day celebrations on July 4. It has the ominous title “Release of Fossil CO2 and the Possibility of a Catastrophic Climate Change.”

One of the first thing that stands out is the stamp at the top, partially elided, saying THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN.

The memo’s author was Frank Press, Carter’s chief science adviser and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Press was a tall, serious, geophysicist who had grown up poor in a Jewish family in Brooklyn, and was described as “brilliant” by his colleagues. Before working with the Carter administration, he had been director of the Seismological Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, and had consulted for federal agencies including the Navy and NASA.

“Carter had a great respect for Frank [Press] and for science,” said Stu Eizenstat, who served as Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser from 1977 to 1981.

Press starts the memo by laying out the science of the climate crisis as it was understood at the time.

Fossil fuel combustion has increased at an exponential rate over the last 100 years. As a result, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is now 12 percent above the pre-industrial revolution level and may grow to 1.5 to 2.0 times that level within 60 years. Because of the “greenhouse effect” of atmospheric CO2 the increased concentration will induce a global climatic warming of anywhere from 0.5 to 5°C.

These far-sighted assertions were in line with the climate science that originated the previous decade, when the US government funded major science agencies focused on space, atmospheric and ocean science. Research produced for President Lyndon B Johnson in 1965 found that billions of tons of “carbon dioxide is being added to the earth’s atmosphere by the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas”.

Press’s memo was on the mark. In 2021, for the first time ever, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 reached 420PPM, the halfway point to the doubling of pre-industrial CO2 levels that Press posited.

The potential effect on the environment of a climatic fluctuation of such rapidity could be catastrophic and calls for an impact assessment of unprecedented importance and difficulty. A rapid climatic change may result in large scale crop failures at a time when an increased world population taxes agriculture to the limits of productivity.

Press was right. We have indeed seen the catastrophic effects of a climatic fluctuation, in the form of increasingly severe weather events including droughts, heatwaves, and hurricanes of greater intensity. Meanwhile, in many parts of the world heating has already stemmed increases in agricultural productivity, and large-scale food production crises are thought to be possible.

The urgency of the problem derives from our inability to shift rapidly to non-fossil fuel sources once the climatic effects become evident not long after the year 2000; the situation could grow out of control before alternate energy sources and other remedial actions become effective.

This is correct. By the 2000s, the effects of the climate crisis had become apparent in some regions in the form of more deadly heat waves and stronger floods and droughts.

Natural dissipation of C02 would not occur for a millennium after fossil fuel combustion was markedly reduced.

This prediction by Press was actually debunked at least a decade ago. Scientists used to believe that some warming was “baked in”, but scientists have since found that as soon as CO2 emissions stop rising, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 levels off and slowly falls.

As you know this is not a new issue. What is new is the growing weight of scientific support which raises the CO2-climate impact from speculation to a serious hypothesis worthy of a response that is neither complacent nor panicky.

But there were other currents mitigating against the sort of response Press calls for. “​​The story of climate policy in the US, generally, is one missed opportunities and unjustifiable delay,” said Jack Lienke, author of the book Struggling for Air: Power Plants and the “War on Coal.”

Many other issues may have seemed more pressing, or simply better understood. As Lienke writes in Struggling for Air, “At a time when Americans were still dying somewhat regularly in acute, inversion-related pollution episodes, it is unsurprising that legislators were more concerned with the known harms of sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide than the uncertain, seemingly distant threat of climate change.”

The authoritative National Academy of Sciences has just alerted us that it will issue a public statement along these lines in a few weeks.

That public statement, released later that month, emphasized the importance of shifting away from fossil fuel energy and highlighted the urgency of starting to transition to new energy sources as soon as possible: “With the end of the oil age in sight, we must make long-term decisions as to future energy policies. One lesson we have been learning is that the time required for transition from one major source to another is several decades.”

So what happened? When Press’s memo made it to the president’s desk, Jim Schlesinger, America’s first secretary of energy, also attached his own note in response:

​​My view is that the policy implications of this issue are still too uncertain to warrant Presidential involvement and policy initiatives.

Carter seems to have heeded this warning, and did not make much progress on climate crisis mitigation during his presidency. Yet he did sign some significant pieces of environmental legislation, including initiating the first federal toxic waste cleanups and creating the first fuel economy standards.

A significant challenge facing Carter was his own contradictory energy aims. Despite his goal of encouraging alternative energy, he also felt there was a national security interest in boosting US oil production in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis.

“We realized our dependence on foreign oil was dangerous and, very importantly, alternative energy was in its infancy,” Eizenstat said. “So Carter was both doing conservation and still encouraging more domestic oil and gas as a way of reducing dependence on foreign oil,” said Eizenstat. “As with all policy, you have conflicting goals.”

Still, it seems possible that if Carter had been re-elected, the world might have been in a better position regarding climate impacts today. One of the first things Reagan did after winning the election in 1981 was take down the White House solar panels. Meanwhile, the fossil fuel industry – whose scientists were already studying the ways that fossil fuels were changing the climate – started spending tens of millions of dollars sowing doubt about climate science.

Did the Press memo accomplish anything at all? For one person it was in fact a “transformational moment” – this was Eizenstat himself. He says it was instrumental in his own future work on the climate crisis, including his decision in 1997 to serve as the United States’s principal negotiator for the Kyoto global warming protocols.

Those protocols set the stage for the first international effort to tackle climate policy on a global level. So even if Press’s memo had a muted impact at the time, his warning wasn’t entirely ignored.",,[],['Emma Pattee']

If the coalition succeeds, more than 3,500 drilling permits issued during the Biden administration could be revoked and future permitting could be far more difficult.

Global regulators set out climate checklist for banks,"Chimneys of a coal-fired power plant are seen behind a gate in Shanghai, China October 21, 2021. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo

LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - Global regulators published a detailed checklist for banks on Wednesday to assess how climate change affects all aspects of their business, including pay and capital, as economies set carbon reduction targets.

International banks like Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and HSBC will be expected to examine whether they are quantifying risks from climate change properly despite sometimes patchy data and time horizons that go well beyond traditional risk assessments and remuneration packages.

The guidance is the latest effort by the Basel Committee, made up of regulators from the United States, Europe, Japan, China and elsewhere, to review how their rulebook covers climate change in a sector at the forefront of efforts to transition to a net-zero economy.

Banks must look at how risks from climate change affect their business strategy, training of senior staff and board members, internal controls, capital and pay over the short, medium and longer term, the guidance showed.

""The board and senior management should consider whether the incorporation of material climate-related financial risks into the bank’s overall business strategy and risk management frameworks may warrant changes to its compensation policies,"" Basel said.

""Banks should identify, monitor and manage all climate-related financial risks that could materially impair their financial condition, including their capital resources and liquidity positions.""

Members of the committee, which include regulators from the United States, Europe, China and Japan, are expected to apply the new guidance as soon as possible, and Basel will monitor compliance.

Regulators say few if any banks have been making such detailed and comprehensive assessments of climate risks.

Separately, banks in the United States, European Union and elsewhere face mandatory disclosures to investors on how climate change is affecting their business.

Beyond Magical Thinking: Time to Get Real on Climate Change,"Despite decades of studies and climate summits, greenhouse gas emissions continue to soar. Energy scientist Vaclav Smil says it’s time to stop ricocheting between apocalyptic forecasts and rosy models of rapid CO2 cuts and focus on the difficult task of remaking our energy system.

The UN’s first climate conference took place in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, and in the intervening decades we have had a series of global meetings and countless assessments and studies. Annual climate change conferences began in 1995 (in Berlin) and included much publicized gatherings in Kyoto (1997, with its completely ineffective agreement), Marrakech (2001), Bali (2007), Cancun (2010), Lima (2014), and Paris (2015). In Paris, about 50,000 people flew to the French capital to attend yet another conference at which they were to strike, we were assured, a “landmark” — and also “ambitious” and “unprecedented” — agreement. Yet the Paris Agreement did not codify any specific reduction targets by the world’s largest emitters. And even if all voluntary non-binding pledges were honored (something utterly improbable), the Paris accord would still result in a 50 percent increase of emissions by 2030. Some landmark. So what have we done to avert, or to reverse, global warming in the three decades since Rio? The data are clear: Between 1989 and 2019, we increased global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by about 67 percent. Affluent countries like the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and those in the European Union — whose per capita energy use was very high three decades ago — did reduce their emissions, but only by about 4 percent. Meanwhile, Indian greenhouse gas emissions increased 4.3 times, and Chinese emissions rose about 4.8 times. Atmospheric CO2 levels, which for centuries fluctuated narrowly at close to 270 parts per million (ppm), rose in the summer of 2020 to above 420 ppm, more than a 50 percent increase over the late 18th-century level.

Regrettably, we have largely ignored taking steps to limit the long-term impacts of climate change.

Clearly, to conclude that we will be able to achieve decarbonization anytime soon, effectively, and on the required scale runs against all past evidence.

The problem is that rather than take a clear-eyed look at the enormous challenges of phasing out the fossil fuels that are the basis of modern industrial economies, we have ricocheted between catastrophism on one hand and the magical thinking of “techno-optimism” on the other.

In recent decades we have multiplied our reliance on the combustion of fossil fuels, resulting in a dependence that will not be severed easily, or inexpensively. How rapidly we can change this remains unclear. Add to this all other environmental worries, and you must conclude that the key existential question — can humanity realize its aspirations within the safe boundaries of our biosphere? — has no easy answers. But it is imperative that we understand the facts of the matter. Only then can we tackle the problem effectively.

Regrettably, we have largely ignored taking steps that could have limited the long-term impacts of climate change and that should have been taken even in the absence of any global warming concerns because they bring long-term savings and provide more comfort. And as if that were not enough, we have deliberately introduced and promoted the diffusion of new products and energy conversions that have boosted the consumption of fossil energies and hence further intensified CO2 emissions.

The best examples of these omissions and commissions are the indefensibly inadequate building codes in cold-climate countries, which lead to an exorbitant waste of energy, and the worldwide adoption of SUVs. SUV ownership began to rise in the U.S. during the late 1980s and eventually diffused globally. By 2020 the average SUV emitted annually about 25 percent more CO2 than a standard car. Multiply that by the 250 million SUVs on the road worldwide in 2020, and you will see how the global embrace of these machines has wiped out, many times over, any decarbonization gains resulting from the slowly spreading ownership (just 10 million worldwide in 2020) of electric vehicles.

During the 2010s, SUVs became the second-highest cause of rising CO2 emissions, behind electricity generation. If their mass public embrace continues, they have the potential to offset any carbon savings from the more than 100 million electric vehicles that might be on the road by 2040. The list of what we have not — but could have — done is long. But to move forward, the first thing we must do is to get real about the primacy of fossil fuels and the challenges ahead. The increasing dependence on fossil fuels is the most important factor in explaining the advances of modern civilization. An average inhabitant of the Earth now has at his or her disposal 700 times more useful energy than their ancestors had at the beginning of the 19th century. An abundance of this energy underlies and explains the gains — from better eating to mass-scale travel; from mechanization of production and transport to instant personal electronic communication — that have become the norms in affluent countries.

Those who chart their preferred paths to a zero-carbon future owe us realistic explanations, not just assumptions.

For those who ignore the energetic and material imperatives of our world, those who prefer mantras of green solutions to understanding how we have come to this point, the prescription is easy: just decarbonize — switch from burning fossil carbon to converting inexhaustible flows of renewable energies. But we are a fossil-fueled civilization whose technical and scientific advances, quality of life, and prosperity rest on the combustion of huge quantities of fossil carbon, and we cannot simply walk away from this critical determinant of our fortunes in a few decades, never mind years.

Complete decarbonization of the global economy by 2050 is now conceivable only at the cost of unthinkable global economic retreat, or as a result of extraordinarily rapid transformations relying on near-miraculous technical advances. To give just a single key comparison, in 2020 the average annual per capita energy supply of about 40 percent of the world’s population (3.1 billion people, which includes nearly all people in sub- Saharan Africa) was no higher than the rate achieved in both Germany and France in 1860. In order to approach the threshold of a dignified standard of living, those 3.1 billion people will need at least to double — but preferably triple — their per-capita energy use, and in doing so multiply their electricity supply, boost their food production, and build essential infrastructures. Inevitably, these demands will subject the biosphere to further degradation. What can we do during the coming decades? We must start with the recognition of fundamental realities. We used to consider a 2-degree C (3.6 F) increase in average global temperature as a relatively tolerable maximum. In 2018, however, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lowered that to 1. 5 C.

But the latest analysis of combined warming effects concluded that we are already committed to global warming of 2.3 C. It seems highly likely that any chance of holding warming to 1.5 degrees is already gone. Even so, many institutions, organizations, and governments are still theorizing about keeping it at that level.

The IPCC report on 1.5 degrees C of warming offers a scenario based on such a sudden and persistent reversal of our reliance on fossil fuels that emissions of CO2 would be halved by 2030 and eliminated by 2050. Computers make it easy to construct scenarios of carbon elimination, but those who chart their preferred paths to a zero-carbon future owe us realistic explanations, not just sets of more or less arbitrary and highly improbable assumptions detached from technical and economic realities and ignoring the embedded nature, massive scale, and enormous complexity of our energy and material systems. One rosy scenario, prepared mostly by European Union researchers and unencumbered by real-world considerations, assumes that average global per capita energy demand in 2050 will be 52 percent lower than it was in 2020. Such a drop would make it easy to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5.C. But cutting per capita energy demand by half in three decades would be an astonishing accomplishment given the fact that over the previous 30 years, global per capita energy demand rose by 20 percent.

What miraculous options will be available to African nations reliant on fossil fuels to supply 90 percent of their energy?

The proponents of this unrealistic scenario allow merely a factor-of-two increase across all modes of mobility during the next three decades in what they call the Global South, and a factor-of-three increase in the ownership of consumer goods. But in the China of the past generation, growth has been on an entirely different scale: In 1999 the country had just 0.34 cars per 100 urban households; in 2019 the number surpassed 40 — a more than hundredfold relative increase in only two decades. In 1990, one out of every 300 urban households in China had an air conditioning window unit; by 2018 there were 142.2 units per 100 households — a more than 400-fold rise in less than three decades.

In a second scenario outlining a goal of complete decarbonization by 2050, a group of energy researchers at Princeton University has charted the required shifts in the U.S. The Princeton scenario builders recognize that it will be impossible to eliminate all fossil fuel consumption and that the only way to achieve net- zero emissions is to resort to what they label the “fourth pillar” of their overall strategy — to mass-scale carbon capture and storage of emitted CO2. Their calculation requires the removal of 0.9 billion to 1.7 billion tons of the gas per year. That would necessitate the creation of an entirely new gas capture-transportation and storage industry that every year would have to handle 1.3 to 2.4 times the volume of current U.S. crude oil production, an industry that took more than 160 years and trillions of dollars to build.

Who could be against solutions that are both cheap and nearly instantly effective, that will create countless well-paying jobs and ensure carefree futures for coming generations? Let us all just sing from these green hymnals, follow all-renewable prescriptions, and a new global nirvana will arrive in just a decade — or, if things get a bit delayed, by 2035. Alas, a close reading reveals that these magic prescriptions give no explanation for how the four material pillars of modern civilization (cement, steel, plastic, and ammonia) will be produced solely with renewable electricity. Nor do they convincingly explain how flying, shipping, and trucking (to which we owe our modern economic globalization) could become 80 percent carbon-free by 2030; they merely assert that it could be so.

What miraculous options will be available to African nations now relying on fossil fuels to supply 90 percent of their primary energy in order to drive down their dependence to 20 percent within a decade? And how will China and India (both countries are still expanding their coal extraction and coal- fired generation) suddenly become coal-free? It makes no sense to argue with the details of what are essentially the academic equivalents of science fiction. They start with arbitrarily set goals (zero by 2030 or by 2050) and work backward to plug in assumed actions to fit those achievements, with actual socioeconomic needs and technical imperatives being of little, or no, concern.

We are increasingly subjected to opposing propensities to embrace catastrophism and techno-optimism.

Reality thus presses in from both ends. The sheer scale, cost, and technical inertia of carbon-dependent activities makes it impossible to eliminate all of these uses in just a few decades. We cannot instantly change the course of a complex system just because somebody decides that the global consumption curve will suddenly reverse its centuries-long ascent and go immediately into a sustained and relatively fast decline. We are increasingly subjected to opposing propensities to embrace catastrophism (those who say there are just years left before the final curtain descends on modern civilization) and techno-optimism (those who predict that the powers of invention will open unlimited horizons beyond the confines of the Earth, turning all terrestrial challenges into inconsequential histories). I have little use for either of these positions. I do not see any already predetermined outcomes, but rather a complicated trajectory contingent on our — far from foreclosed— choices. Catastrophists have always had a hard time imagining that human ingenuity can meet future food, energy, and material needs — but during the past three generations we have done so despite a tripling of the global population since 1950. And techno-optimists, who promise endless, near-miraculous solutions, must reckon with a similarly poor record. One of the best-known failures has been the belief in the all-encompassing power of nuclear fission as the solution to our energy needs. In the latest burst of intensified catastrophism, some journalists and activists write about climate apocalypse now, issuing final warnings: In the future, areas best suited for human habitation will shrink, large areas of the Earth are to become uninhabitable soon, climate migration will reshape America and the world, average global income will decline substantially. Some prophecies claim that we might only have about a decade left to avert a global catastrophe.

I am convinced that we could do without this continuing flood of never-less-than-worrisome and too-often-quite-frightening predictions. How helpful is it to be told every day that the world is coming to an end in 2050 or even 2030? And if these claims are true, why should we even worry about global warming?

On the other side, why is it that some scientists keep on charting such arbitrarily bending and plunging curves leading to near-instant decarbonization? And why are others promising the early arrival of technical super-fixes that will support high standards of living for all humanity? There are no limits to assembling such models, leaving prognosticators to posit 100 percent inexpensive thermonuclear electricity or cold fusion by 2050. Only the imagination limits these assumptions: they range from fairly plausible to patently delusionary. Such predictably repetitive prophecies (however well-meant and however passionately presented) do not offer any practical advice about the deployment of the best possible technical solutions, about the most effective ways of legally binding global cooperation, or about tackling the difficult challenge of convincing populations of the need for significant expenditures whose benefits will not be seen for decades to come. The fact is that we can make a great deal of difference, but not by pretending to follow unrealistic and arbitrary goals. History does not unfold as a computerized academic exercise with major achievements falling on years ending with zero or five; it is full of discontinuities, reversals, and unpredictable departures.

We cannot know to what extent we will succeed by 2050, and thinking about 2100 is truly beyond our ken.

We can proceed fairly quickly with the displacement of coal- fired electricity by natural gas (when produced and transported without significant methane leakage, it has a substantially lower carbon intensity than coal) and by expanding solar and wind electricity generation. We can move away from SUVs and accelerate mass-scale deployment of electric cars. And we still have large inefficiencies in construction, household, and commercial energy use that can be profitably reduced or eliminated.

Decarbonization of electricity generation can make the fastest progress, because installation costs per unit of solar or wind capacity can now compete with the least expensive fossil-fueled choices. And some countries have already transformed their generation to a considerable degree. Major reductions in carbon emissions — resulting from the combination of continued efficiency gains, better system designs, and moderated consumption — are possible, and a determined pursuit of these goals would limit the eventual rate of global warming. But we cannot know to what extent we will succeed by 2050, and thinking about 2100 is truly beyond our ken. For example, was there a single climate modeler who predicted in 1980 the most important anthropogenic factor driving global warming over the last 30 years: the economic rise of China? What remains in doubt is our collective — in this case global — resolve to deal effectively with at least some critical challenges. Affluent countries could reduce their average per-capita energy use by large margins and still retain a comfortable quality of life. Widespread diffusion of simple technical fixes, ranging from mandated triple windows to designs of more durable vehicles, would have significant cumulative effects.

The reality is that any sufficiently effective steps will be decidedly non-magical, gradual, and costly. We have been transforming the environment on increasing scales and with rising intensity for millennia, and we have derived many benefits from these changes — but, inevitably, the biosphere has suffered. There are ways to reduce those impacts, but the resolve to deploy them at required scales has been lacking, and if we start acting in a sufficiently effective manner on a global scale, we will have to pay a considerable economic and social price. Will we act deliberately, with foresight, or will we act only when forced by deteriorating conditions?

New departures, new solutions, and new achievements are always with us. We are a very inquisitive species with a remarkable long-term record of adaptation and with even more remarkable recent accomplishments in making the lives of most of the world’s population healthier, richer, safer, and longer. Still, fundamental constraints persist: We have changed some of them through our ingenuity, but such adjustments have their own limits. And in a civilization where production of essential commodities now serves nearly 8 billion people, any departure from established practices also runs into the constraints of scale. Even though the supply of new renewables (wind, solar, new biofuels) rose impressively — about fiftyfold during the first 20 years of the 21st century — the world’s dependence on fossil carbon declined only marginally, from 87 percent to 85 percent of the total supply. Moreover, any effective commitments will be expensive and will have to last for at least two generations in order to bring the desired outcome (of much reduced, if not totally eliminated, greenhouse gas emissions). And even drastic reductions going well beyond anything that could be realistically envisaged will not show any convincing benefits for decades. This raises the extraordinarily difficult problem of intergenerational justice — that is, our never- failing propensity to discount the future.



I am neither a pessimist nor an optimist. I am a scientist trying to explain how the world really works.

We value now more than later, and we price it accordingly. Should average global life expectancy (about 72 years in 2020) remain the same, the generation born near the middle of the 21st century would be the first to experience a cumulative economic net benefit from climate-change mitigation policies. Are the young citizens of affluent countries ready to put these distant benefits ahead of their more immediate gains? Are they willing to sustain this course for more than half a century?

Nobody in 1945 could have predicted a world with more than 5 billion additional people that is also better fed than at any time in history. A lifetime later, there is no reason to believe that we are in a better position to foresee the extent of coming technical innovations, the events that will shape the fortunes of nations, and the decisions (or their regrettable absence) that will determine the fate of our civilization during the next 75 years.",,[],"['Vaclav Smil', 'Carolyn Beans', 'Bill Mckibben', 'Nicola Jones']"
Is climate change making the weather worse?,"United Nations climate scientists say it's "" now or never "" to stop catastrophic temperature rises and a breakdown of the climate systems on which our way of life depends. Reports of bomb-like blizzards and searing droughts paint a terrifying picture of the possible reality of climate change . But are we actually witnessing the weather getting worse?

Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Weather is getting worse for people in the U.S. and globally, Spencer Weart, a historian and retired director of the Center for History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Maryland, told Live Science.

Climate is the average of weather over time, and Earth has a long and dramatic history of natural climate change. The Triassic period (252 million to 201 million years ago) may have ended with a million-year rainstorm . And the dino-killing asteroid hitting Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period (145 million to 66 million years ago) plunged parts of the sky into cold darkness for years under dense clouds of ash and particles; then, Earth's temperatures spiked for 100,000 years , due to the colossal amount of carbon dioxide the asteroid kicked up when it smashed into the Yucatán Peninsula; a massive asteroid strike is still technically a natural event, albeit a sad one for the dinosaurs .

While major climatic swings are nothing new to our planet, they have been incredibly destructive in the past, and our current insatiable appetite for fossil fuels is setting in motion a rapid swing that could have dire consequences for humanity.

Related: Has the Earth ever been this hot before?

Modern records reveal an unnatural global warming trend taking hold of Earth's climate in recent decades. By burning fossil fuels, humans are sending heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that are raising global temperatures.

Experimental data and climate models suggest this warming will affect weather in a variety of ways, making it hotter and colder, more extreme, more chaotic and in a word, ""worse."" For example, as the world gets warmer, more water evaporates from the surface of dry areas and increases precipitation in wet areas, according to Weart. In other words, dry areas get drier and wet areas get wetter. More moisture in the atmosphere in a warming planet can also lead to heavier snowfall during the winter .

Weart pointed to severe North Atlantic hurricanes in the Caribbean and U.S. in recent years, as well as hurricanes, or tropical cyclones, around the world as examples of worsening weather. ""There's very little question that everywhere the hurricanes are getting worse,"" he said.

We are not necessarily seeing an increase in the number of hurricanes, but the bad ones are becoming more severe. ""What would have been a Category 3 [hurricane] is a Category 4, what would have been a Category 4 is a Category 5 ,"" Weart said.

Category 5 includes the strongest hurricanes , with winds of 156 mph (251 km/h) or more. There's no Category 6 hurricane because the Saffir-Simpson scale only deals with wind, and the damage wind does is about the same above 156 mph, although some scientists think the scale needs revising, Live Science previously reported.

Meanwhile, record-breaking weather events, such as the 2018 heatwave in Japan that killed more than 1,000 people, are likely to become more common, Weart noted. For instance, in a 2018 study published in the journal Scientific Online Letters on the Atmosphere (opens in new tab) (SOLA), researchers ran climate computer simulations and found the heatwave could not have happened without human-induced global warming. A 2020 study published in the journal Nature Communications (opens in new tab) also found heatwaves are increasing around the world.

Furthermore, although it sounds counterintuitive, global warming could be causing colder snaps. A 2021 study published in the journal Science (opens in new tab) found a warming Arctic and disruptions to the swirling cold winds above it called the polar vortex is linked to more extreme winters in the Northern Hemisphere, including the U.S., but climate scientists are still debating this link, Nature reported (opens in new tab).

Climate change may have the potential to disrupt the weather systems so much that Earth turns into a chaotic world that can't be fixed, Live Science previously reported. A 2022 study published on the preprint database arXiv (opens in new tab) found that if we don't reduce our emissions, humans run the risk of Earth's temperature fluctuating chaotically in a way that's impossible to predict.

So, what are we doing to combat climate change and stave off a future filled with more terrible weather? Nations around the world signed up to the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 and agreed to keep warming preferably below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) and well below 3.6 F (2 C). But, in 2022, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres said at the Economist Sustainability Summit (opens in new tab) that the 1.5-degree goal was on ""life support"" and with continued emissions, ""we are sleepwalking to climate catastrophe.""

World leaders need to ensure that global carbon dioxide emissions begin declining by 2025 and are halved by 2030 if we are to stay within 1.5 C of warming, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report (opens in new tab) — likely the last IPCC report before irreversible climate breakdown becomes unavoidable, Live Science previously reported.

""It's like we've suddenly become a protagonist in a science fiction movie: 'only you can save civilization from global disaster,'"" Weart said. ""But it's not science fiction.""

Homebuyer Climate Change Concerns: Inland Flooding,"Most homebuyers consider the size, location, and layout of a home. But it’s increasingly important to assess how climate change will impact the home you purchase. As the effects of the climate crisis intensify, some areas are experiencing increased rainfall and storm events, which can cause inland flooding. Sadly, this can wreak havoc on communities and make homes unlivable.

Most cities are covered largely by impermeable surfaces like roads and buildings and have drainage systems equipped to handle excess water from precipitation. Underground pipes carry water and discharge it into the water system. However, these stormwater management systems can get overwhelmed, causing inland flooding or flash floods. Let’s explore the implications of flooding on home shoppers.

What Causes Inland Flooding?

When the quantity of water on land exceeds its natural or constructed drainage capacity, flooding occurs. Prolonged rainfall for many days, intense but brief precipitation events, failed dams and levees, and rapidly melting snowpack are all common causes. Inland flooding is different from coastal flooding, which involves seawater.

Although precipitation is certainly a natural occurrence, humans have contributed to inland flooding by constructing homes and businesses without proper attention to stormwater management. Urbanization commonly leads to more paved surfaces and alters natural drainage systems. Developers build homes in flood plains. These factors make an area more prone to inland flooding. In areas where climate change is causing more intense storm events, the risk increases.

How Does Inland Flooding Impact Home Shoppers?

Although it can be nice to live with water nearby, it definitely isn’t nice for this water to find its way into your new home. According to FEMA, just one inch of floodwater can lead to $25,000 in home damage.

Before purchasing a home, determine the flood risk of the property. FEMA has three main classifications related to flooding and designates zones as high-risk, moderate-risk, and low-risk. Look up the property address using the FEMA Flood Map Service Center to determine the risk level of various homes. Also, learn the flood history of the property if you can obtain this information.

Knowing the home’s flood risk level helps you make an informed purchasing decision. Also, the construction of the home makes a difference, as some properties have an inherently more resilient design. Also, if you live in a high-risk area, you might not be able to get a mortgage without purchasing flood insurance.

Should I Buy a House in an Area Prone to Inland Flooding?

It is critical to weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before purchasing a new home. If you decide to buy a home in a flood-prone area, make sure you have the proper insurance coverage. Just an inch or two of floodwater can cause tens of thousands of dollars in damage.

Many homeowner insurance policies don’t cover flood damage. In these cases, it is essential to have a separate policy to protect yourself from flood damage. The same is true for renter policies, so advise your tenants accordingly if you rent out the property.

The average annual cost of flood insurance is $771, but this is likely to increase and is probably higher in flood-prone areas. It’s a good idea to price out policies before buying a home so you can include the premiums in your budget. Also, remember that being in a flood-prone area might make it harder to sell your home, so it can have long-term financial implications.

How Can I Protect My Home From Flood Losses?

While insurance protects you financially, it won’t prevent the havoc and destruction of experiencing a flood. It’s important to be prepared to minimize flood losses. A sump pump can help remove water from a basement or crawlspace but can fail if there is a power outage. Having a backup battery for your sump pump is a good way to help protect your home.

Have a plan for how you can block floodwaters from reaching the home’s foundation. Regularly clear debris from gutters and downspouts so they are in proper working order. Consider extending the downspouts so water exits further from the house. If water naturally flows towards the house, it’s important to redirect it away from your foundation. In addition, there are landscaping practices that can help, such as constructing a berm with a swale or rain garden.

FEMA recommends elevating and anchoring your critical utilities, including your electrical panel, propane tank, sockets, wiring, appliances, and heating systems. If flooding is inevitable, move valuables to an attic or second floor and elevate furniture to prevent water damage. Take photos or videos of all major household items so you have documentation if you need to file an insurance claim.

Of course, safety is the number one priority. If there is a flood, make sure you, your loved ones, and your pets are safe. Monitor the local news and weather alerts to stay informed.

Purchasing a home is a big decision, so it’s crucial to examine various environmental factors that could shape your life. If you buy a house prone to inland flooding, take steps to protect your home and promote safety. You’ll need to take many of these steps in advance, not when a major storm is on its way, so proper planning is essential.

"Climate Change Impact Threatens Habitats of Migratory Birds, New Study Finds","A flock of blackbirds search for trees to perch on in the town on Hopkinsville, Kentucky February 16, 2013. (Reuters)

London - Asharq Al-Awsat

The global impact of climate change is threatening the habitats of some migratory birds along their migration route in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, reported the German news agency.

Based on the findings of a recent study, the Joint Wadden Sea Secretariat in Wilhelmshaven announced Monday that the rising sea level in northwestern Europe is one of the main challenges facing migratory birds.

The Wadden Sea off the coasts of Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands is considered the hub of East Atlantic bird migration.

Millions of birds eat up food reserves for their onward flight between Africa and the Arctic in the UNESCO-listed wetland.

“Climate change affects most coastal regions. For example, in addition to sea level rise in the Wadden Sea, extreme weather events such as heavy rain and storms are increasingly affecting the resting and breeding birds,” explained Kristine Meise, program manager for Migration and Biodiversity at the Wadden Sea Secretariat.

“The consequences of climate change, for example the erosion of coasts, are already being felt in the main wintering area off West Africa,” she added.

According to the study, other factors such as overfishing, shipping, and logging have an even greater influence there.

The assessment of habitat’s exertion was part of a study published in late April.

The project has been counting migratory bird populations along the East Atlantic bird migration route every three years since 2014.

The last census in 2020 involved more than 13,000 people in 36 countries.

According to Meise, these regular statistics are of great importance to spot the changing numbers of birds in an early stage, but “the process is difficult because birds normally don’t stay in one place, and sometimes, change their flying routes. This means that one species could be shrinking in the Wadden Sea, but stable or even growing in other parts of the world.”

She noted that counting requires synchronous statistics in all the locations of those birds.

Compared to data from the past decades, the 2020 census shows an increase in the number of 83 migratory groups. The population of birds was stable in 16 percent of these groups, while the researchers recorded a decrease in 30 percent of them, such as the waders that breed in the Siberian Arctic.

Meise suggested the changing climate conditions are the culprit behind those uneven numbers.

“The migratory birds have adapted to schedules over thousands of years. Due to climate change, spring, and thus snowmelt and insects hatching in the Arctic are beginning earlier. This would result in poorer breeding and rearing conditions for young birds, and a lower breeding success.” she said.

To face these threats and preserve migratory birds, the study’s authors have called for protecting the birds’ favorite habitats and applying sustainable preservation measures.",,[],"['Asharq Al-Awsat', 'London - Asharq Al-Awsat']"
"Fiji says Asia's biggest security threat is climate change, not conflict","(Reuters) Fiji's defense minister said on Sunday that climate change posed the biggest security threat in the Asia-Pacific region, a shift in tone at a defense summit dominated by the war in Ukraine and disputes between China and the United States.

Bill Nye has been the go-to science guy for teachers and students for decades, most notably with his PBS show, ""Bill Nye the Science Guy.""

In recent years, he has been vocal advocate for battling climate change. That will be a featured topic in his new show, “The End is Nye,” which is scheduled to air later this year on Peacock.

Nye spoke to USA TODAY this week to answer some of the most commonly Googled questions about climate change and global warming.

What is global warming? When did it start? How does climate change affect humans, animals and the ocean?

The ""science guy"" himself has answers to those questions and more. Here's what he had to say.

Note: Responses have been edited for length and clarity.

More from Bill Nye: 'I was ticked off': Bill Nye talks viral TikTok, reflects on 'Science Guy' success

Climate change: Here's the thing about that dire climate report: We have the tools we need to fix things

What is climate change?

Nye: So global warming is causing climate change. By holding this extra heat in the atmosphere, we are changing the world's climate faster than ever in recorded history, but faster than ever in Earth's history with the exception of when asteroids hit the Earth.

What is global warming?

Nye: Humans are adding an extraordinary amount of extra greenhouse gases; the biggest one is carbon dioxide, and then methane. We're adding these gases to the atmosphere so fast that the world has never gotten this warm this fast.

Visible light comes through past these molecules, like carbon dioxide, hits the Earth's surface where it goes to a longer wavelength, to infrared. These gases hold in a lot of that infrared, that heat.

The world is getting warmer, and with a warmer world, we have more heat energy in the ocean and storms are bigger and stick around longer. We're changing global weather patterns where it's getting to be this huge drought out West and very rainy out East.

Downpour: People haven't just made the planet hotter. We've changed the way it rains.

Is global warming real? Do you have any response to people who say it's not real?

Nye: Well, to the people who say it's not real, you're wrong. The scientific consensus on human-caused climate change is overwhelming. People who are in denial have been influenced too strongly by the fossil fuel industry. (The fossil fuel industry) has been able to introduce the idea that plus or minus 2% is the same as plus or minus 100%.

For example, this ice sheet in Antarctica, this huge slab of ice is going to break off of Antarctica and fall into the sea. Antarctica is the only continent under water; it's under ice. When a big piece of this ice falls into the ocean, we're going to add a lot more freshwater to the ocean, and a lot more water to the ocean. Sea levels are going to rise and the salinity of the ocean, especially in the south, is going to change very fast.

People say, ""Well, when is that going to be? Is it going to be tomorrow or 10 years from now?"" When it comes to geological processes, plus or minus 10 years is extraordinarily accurate. Some people, they say ""Well, then that's too much uncertainty. You don't know what you're talking about."" That's wrong. The uncertainty of climate change is very small. Humans are causing it. It's global. It's changing climates around the world.

‘Death by 1,000 cuts’: How the US Forest Service is losing a war over water in the West

When did global warming start?

Nye: People like to say around the year 1750; this is when James Watt, who was a mechanical engineer, got a steam engine that worked very well. A lot of people had been messing around with making steam engines for decades. The middle of the 18th century is when steam engines really got to be practical and ended up everywhere. When that happened, people started burning coal and digging up ancient plants and ancient swamps which had turned to coal. (People were) burning the coal and ancient swamps, adding carbon dioxide, which had been buried when these plants were alive, and putting that carbon back in the atmosphere very, very fast. We're talking about the last 2½ centuries. Compare 250 years with 2½ million years and that's very fast. We're adding carbon dioxide faster and faster and faster, and it's warming the world faster.

How can we stop global warming?

Nye: You probably cannot stop global warming in anybody's lifetime that's alive now.

What we can do is address it and deal with it, get ready for it, and reduce the rate at which it's happening.

We can do that by stopping the addition of carbon monoxide, especially, and then methane into the atmosphere; stop that as soon as we can. The way to stop that is to stop burning fossil fuels. The way to stop that is to provide alternative sources of electricity. This is where we get into wind, solar, geothermal, and perhaps one day nuclear fusion, where we'd have virtually unlimited supplies of electricity distributed around the world. We can stop burning fossil fuels. We could then slowly remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere using the same unlimited amount of electricity.

To do all this, we've got to get started. Let's go. Let's get going!

How does climate change affect people?

Nye: If you live out West in California, there are water restrictions. I have a garden where I raise a lot of food; I can only water it on Thursdays and Sundays.

And there is not (the same amount of) snow in the mountains in California that would normally or used to be there. Because the world is getting warmer, the weather patterns over the Pacific Ocean are changing. It's not snowing as much as it used to, so we're not storing water as snow in the mountains the way we used to. The reason you and I are able to eat lunch and dinner today is because of food grown out West, food grown in Mexico. Those crops depend on rainfall and water stored as snow.

As we stop having water stored in reservoirs, we're not going to be able to grow as much food, and that will lead to trouble. People are going to go looking for food. They're going to move around. Food prices are going to go up, and this is one more thing that affects poor people more quickly than wealthy people. People who can't afford to get the scarcer food are going to be affected more strongly.

How does climate change affect animals?

Nye: Animals are changing where they live; they're moving.

Animals that are really moving are insects. There's this infamous beetle that attacks trees out West. As the world has gotten warmer and the winters are more mild, these beetles that have been able to attack more trees and kill them. When the occasional lightning storm does come through, it starts fires and we can't put the fires out because the trees are dead and the wind's blowing and the fires spread, which by the way, adds more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, destroys the ecosystem and chases all the wildlife away and kills everything.

It's bad, bad, bad.

You did talk about the ocean and salinity changing. How else does climate change affect the ocean?

Nye: Greenland is a very large island with a lot of ice on top of it; that ice is sloughing off into the sea, changing the ocean's saltiness. When you change that part of the ocean's saltiness, you change the way the currents flow.

You've probably heard of this famous current called the Gulf Stream. The reason we have ice-free harbors in Norway is because the Gulf Stream keeps it a little bit warm. The reason there's all this wonderful agriculture in Europe – French wines, Italian wines – is because the Gulf Stream keeps that part of Eurasia somewhat warmer than it would be otherwise. By making this central part of the Gulf Stream fresher, less salty, the saltwater doesn't sink as fast; this layer of freshwater stays on top, and this is slowing the clockwise circulation of the Gulf Stream. That will affect the climate in Europe, and that will affect the ability of people to raise food in Europe, and that will affect the economies of Europe, and that will affect everybody in the world.

How does climate change affect biodiversity?

Nye: In the case of the forest and the beetles, when you kill a bunch of trees, the ecosystem is damaged very fast; only certain species can hang in there. When you lose diversity in the ecosystem, the ecosystem becomes less resilient, less flexible, less able to tolerate changes.

This is very well-documented over the last 60 or 70 years; as you destroy diversity in ecosystems, things just get worse and worse in ecosystems. This is true in forests. It's true in the ocean. Carbon dioxide is in the air; it gets dissolved into seawater because the air is touching the ocean. The ocean becomes slightly more acidic. This slight, slight change in the free protons floating around in the ocean makes it impossible for (animals that make coral reefs) to live. When you lose the coral in the ocean, you lose the nooks and crannies for many, many, many other species and organisms to live. When you do that, you have less diversity in the ocean.

How does recycling help climate change?

Nye: Almost all the clothes almost all of us wear have some plastic in them. These materials are amazing, but they have an affect on the ecosystem. We don't want to throw this plastic away. We want to recover it and reuse it.

Especially in the case of aluminum. Aluminum takes so much energy to produce. It takes a lot of electricity to produce that from rocks. Recycling it is fantastic. We want to get everybody in the habit of not throwing this stuff away.

The other problems, with the example of plastic, we can address those problems in the coming years. But right now let's start with not throwing it away. The way we handle trash, a lot of the stuff ends up in the ocean. How does it get from the land to the ocean? We throw it away and it rolls downhill. So everybody, let's cut it out. There's all kinds of ways to incentivize to get people to do the right thing with materials. Let's start with recycling!

"How the pawpaw, also known as a hillbilly mango, could be a climate change winner in NC","How the pawpaw, also known as a hillbilly mango, could be a climate change winner in NC

North Carolina isn't known for its tropical fruits. Neither is Missouri, West Virginia or southern Ontario, for that matter.

But likely unbeknownst to most Americans (and Canadians), the largest edible fruit tree native to North America grows in most states east of the Mississippi. And the taste of its fruit, which is full of healthy goodies like antioxidants, has been compared to a cross between a mango and a banana.

So why aren't pawpaw fruit and products overflowing at supermarkets and health food stores?

That's complicated, experts say. But with climate change expected to bring new challenges to the world's food supplies and supply chain issues already playing havoc with global trade, looking local is increasingly seen as a safe, viable and smart option for protecting and increasing food supplies.

Want pawpaw beer or cider? Prepare to look far and wide in North Carolina

But making pawpaw a staple in the American diet could be difficult.

Dr. Mike Parker, a tree fruit specialist with N.C. State University, said besides convincing those who might find the pawpaw's texture and taste difficult to stomach, there's a more basic issue.

“The problem is getting trees into production and getting the fruit to market,"" he said. ""Quite frankly, they rot too quickly.""

That doesn't mean, though, that some local communities haven't already discovered and embraced the humble pawpaw. That can be seen in the fruit's long list of local nicknames — Quaker delight, American custard apple, hillbilly mango and, now that it's got a growing ""cool"" reputation, hipster banana.

CLEAN AIR CONUNDRUM: Coastal areas love their clean air. A new study finds that hurricanes do, too

""It's just so different,"" said Derek Morris, a horticulture technician with the N.C. Cooperative Extension in Forsyth County who has helped organize the annual N.C. Pawpaw Festival in Winston-Salem for the past 15 years. ""It's like a magical fruit that shouldn't be here.""

The pawpaw patch

According to the United Nations, 13 crops provide 80% of people’s caloric intake worldwide, with about half of those calories coming from wheat, corn and rice. But some of these crops may not grow well in the higher temperatures, unpredictable rainfall and extreme weather events caused by climate change. Warmer temperatures are also expected to bring a new wave of pests and diseases to temperate areas, like much of the United States.

Enter the pawpaw, a tree that's surprisingly hardy and flexible in where it grows.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, pawpaws grow ""in the shade in open woods usually in wet, fertile bottomlands, but can grow in upland areas on rich soils."" They can form thick clusters when they grow in the understory of forests, often spreading quickly to create a “pawpaw patch.”

Adaptable in nearly all temperate climates, pawpaws require some period of cold weather to fruit. That means while their range extends into southern Canada, it doesn't grow much south of Gainesville, Florida.

The pawpaw also isn't some new exotic fruit that's just arrived on the scene. Spanish conquistadors reported eating pawpaws with Native Americans, and members of Lewis and Clark's expedition relied on the fruit while exploring the new Louisiana Purchase in the early 19th century. Urban legend has it that chilled pawpaws were also George Washington's favorite dessert.

From Manteo to Wilmington, could the 'kudzu of the coast' help fight climate change?

The tree, which is unusual in that it's pollinated by flies and beetles instead of bees, is also the exclusive host plant for the zebra swallowtail butterfly, which is viewed by many as one of the most beautiful butterflies in the world.

While native and covering a huge range, experts warn the pawpaw could have to endure some of the same challenges more common fruits and crops grown in the Eastern U.S. face as the climate changes and pests and diseases migrate along with the warmer weather.

“Just because it’s native, that doesn’t mean it's adapted to, if we want to call it, a changing climate,"" Parker said. ""But you would think it might be better able to tolerate some of those changes than other species.""

'A magical fruit'

Morris said people are fascinated by pawpaws, from its taste to the fact that trees with a mango-like fruit grows in their backyard.

But it can be an acquired taste for some.

""I have friends that like them and I have friends that won’t talk to me after eating them,"" Parker said with a laugh. ""It’s a very unique fruit.""

Morris echoed the sentiment.

CHANGING LANDSCAPE: On the Outer Banks, structures rise and fall as climate change looms

“It’s very different from any fruit we can grow here. And the flavor, that tropical flavor is very different,"" he said.

While some like eating the soft, custard-like pulp fresh from the fruit, Morris said most people use the fruit in products like hot sauces, baked goods, smoothies and desserts.

“I have yet to meet a person who doesn’t like pawpaw ice cream, even if they don’t like pawpaws,"" he added.

In recent years, the growth of fruity alcohols — including beer and spirits like brandy — has fueled a surge in pawpaw demand and popularity.

“It’s like a magical fruit,"" Morris said. ""It’s like something that shouldn’t be here.""

Not Big Ag friendly

In the United States the center of pawpaw research is Kentucky State University (KSU), which is home to the USDA's pawpaw gene bank.

While pawpaws — the origin of the name isn't fully known, although many believe it has Native American origins — have always been grown commercially in small numbers by some specialty farmers or collected in the wild by others for home use, KSU's Sheri Crabtree said the fruit's popularity has really taken off in the last two decades as the sustainable food movement has grown and more ""foodies"" seek out new and unique tastes.

""That it's unusual, rare and not something that's usually easy to get except at farmers markets or specialty stores has made it even more attractive to some,"" she said.

So why can't you find pawpaws in your neighborhood grocery's fruit aisle?

Blame a mix of modern farming techniques and people's desire for a food product year-round.

RELATED: Want pawpaw beer or cider? Prepare to look far and wide in North Carolina

Parker and Crabtree said pawpaws aren't the type of fruit that fits in easily to the business model of Big Agriculture.

""They bruise easily, and they have a very short shelf life when compared to other fruits and vegetables, which makes it difficult to ship and store,"" Crabtree said, noting that even in cold storage the fruit will likely only last for a few weeks.

Since pawpaws generally ripen in August or September, depending on how far north the trees are, that means the fruit is most often seen at markets in late summer or early fall. Pawpaw's short shelf life means the pulp is often removed from the fruit, frozen and then used in other products.

That could make it a challenge for pawpaws to enter mainstream American diets.

""But as a product for niche markets, it has great potential,"" Parker said. ""And if you know where to look, it already is.""

How Mapping Indigenous Knowledge is Helping Nomadic Communities to Fight Climate Change—and Extinction,"When Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim was growing up in the 1980s, along the shores of Lake Chad, she was dazzled by her elder’s knowledge of the land. “Reading the clouds, listening to the wind, they could tell you that in several hours it’s going to rain,” Ibrahim recalls. “By following the birds’ migrations, observing the trees’ leaves and the plants’ fruits and flowers, and even the direction the cattle face, our elders can predict if the rainy season is coming and if the dry season will be strong or light, and then adapt our migration pattern for the year.”

Ibrahim is Mbororo, part of a nomadic pastoralist people who have grazed the land around Lake Chad for millennia. “We live in harmony with nature, because we depend on it for food, fresh water, materials,” Ibrahim says. An award-winning climate change and indigenous rights advocate, and environmental activist, Ibrahim has spent her career advancing the rights of indigenous communities, particularly those around Lake Chad.

The lake, which straddles the borders of Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Niger, is an ancient expanse of water that was once as large as the Caspian Sea. Today, Lake Chad remains a crucial source of fresh water for more than around 40 million people, as well as a vital ecosystem for countless wildlife. But in recent decades, it has been shrinking at a devastating rate. “In the early 1980s, Lake Chad covered 10,000 square kilometers and was one of Africa’s five largest fresh-water reservoirs. Today, the lake is only 1,250 square kilometers. Almost 90 percent has disappeared—evaporated—in my lifetime,” Ibrahim says.

As with indigenous groups in the Arctic and the South Pacific, the pastoral Mbororo communities around Lake Chad have found themselves on the front lines of climate change. “In Chad, right now, the climate is already changing. I was home in the community during the first days of April, where we faced a heatwave of 130°F (54.4°C),” Ibrahim says. “In the Sahel, the average temperature has increased by more than 1.5°C over the last century, meaning we have already missed the Paris Agreement target. Extreme weather events, with drought, floods, and desertification, are becoming the new reality.”

The shifting climate—drier, hotter, and more extreme—has devastated the livelihoods of the nomadic pastoral communities, and particularly the cattle herds that are the foundation of their existence. “For example, 20 years ago, we used to milk our cattle twice a day, even during the dry season. Today, because of climate change and the lack of water, we can milk them only once every two days. That means that milk production, which is our main economic activity, has been divided by four in a couple of generations,” Ibrahim says.

As the local climate has changed and resources come under strain, the situation has put pressure on local communities—particularly between pastoralists, farmers, and fisherman. In some cases, the pressure has forced people to migrate to urban areas, where they end up living in informal settlements. “That’s why I have decided to fight. Because if we don’t take action against climate change, my people simply face extinction.”",,[],"['Condé Nast', 'Advertisement Feature With']"
Europe to act right now against climate change,"This is an opinion article by an external contributor. The views belong to the writer.

It is the year 2035. Exactly 13 years after the European Commission announced that they were one step closer to adopting a common charging solution for our electronic devices.

Also, 13 years after the same executive promised that by this year, all new car sales should be zero emissions. I remember the day they announced it, I had such a hard time deciding if I should open the cava to celebrate or not. But, thanks to them, we are finally saved from climate change. Really, big thanks, people.

As I am getting ready to go to the office, I take a glance throughout the window, just to see if it will snow, or if I will be sweating all day. The sky looks pretty clear, so I take my chance on just a T-shirt and shorts. Sandals will be too much, I think, so I decide to wear my sneakers instead.

Once down my building, I ride my 15-year-old second-hand bicycle that I bought pre-material crisis era, and I head down to the train station. The streets are full of cars. And I wonder what would have happened if they just banned all kind of cars and invested in greener transportation.

I can only imagine a city full of scooters, bicycles, and maybe new means of transport I don’t even know about yet. But, instead, I still see all those cars, most of them still with a combustion engine, since the huge all-in-one-crisis didn’t allow the working class to acquire zero emissions cars.

Once I arrive at the train station, I see there are still some delays, which makes me wonder, really, why didn’t they choose to invest in public transport instead? When the train makes it to my destination, it starts snowing. And I blame myself for having trusted my guts, rather than having checked the climate change app.

This app is frankly awesome, since it informs about the exact weather per hour, depending on the latitude you live in, what’s the sea level at this point of time in your region, and the number of natural disasters that happened in the proximity during the last couple of years.

I finally arrive to the office. Cold, but safe. When I sit down and I take out the laptop of my bag, I leave my phone on the desktop to realize just in that moment that I have almost no battery. The frustration starts building up, and I’m about to go savage on the world just because I am so stupid that I left it home.

But then I remember: “wait a second, we have a common charging solution! We made it happen! I can charge my phone with a regular charger!” And as I observe the tornado occurring just in front of our office space, I tell myself: “wow, who would have thought, our institution did fight against climate change after all.”

As the tornado keeps on beating all those parked cars and starts breaking windows of the building in front of ours, I realize what a soft change that was. And it’s only then when I start thinking…

“Gosh I wish the European Commission could have done more. I wish someone would have told our politicians and executive bodies back then that we needed a radical change. I wish there would have been scientific papers, demonstrations, and an entire community of people asking them for that change. I wish… I wish they had listened to all of us. But they hadn’t. They just… hadn’t.”",,[],['The Brussels Times']
OPINION | Heed the youth on climate change,"To end the climate wars globally, those of us with the means to do so need to urgently promote and amplify new stories and narratives that connect to and reflect the values and views of the world’s youth.

The idea that climate action can encompass a positive vision for the future — not just for the West but everyone — must be central to the stories we tell. Sharing these stories can serve as a catalyst for delivering on the hopes and dreams of billions of people.

Fortunately, young people are powerful storytellers and are already using their own experiences to lead movements. They are already being heard and now, they must be listened to.

A definitive cliche of COP26 in Glasgow is that it resulted in division, blame sharing, inaction and deadlock. Rich economies failed again to provide the levels of financing promised for so long while simultaneously (and hypocritically) pressuring developing economies to step up. Some emerging economies essentially said they will wait for the “rich world” to push the financial envelope forward before rushing to meet the challenges of a global disaster they refuse to feel — and arguably, historically at least, are not — co-responsible for.

And all the while, seemingly abandoned and unheard, the world’s most vulnerable societies stand evermore on the precipice of climate calamity with every passing day. The consequences will be most acutely felt by young people.

Yet, in town halls and municipal council chambers around the world lively and constructive discussions are taking place on how to accelerate the shift to cleaner forms of energy while avoiding social and economic upheaval. Avoiding such upheaval is especially critical when some of the necessary actions threaten the power of business elites and governments (such as removing fossil fuel subsidies).

Contrary to overused tropes about a “disengaged youth”, these conversations are largely prompted by young people, especially those from the world’s developing regions, who represent 88% of the global youth. Concern for climate change is something we see in the actions and responses of Global Citizens.

Ahead of COP26, we invited individuals on our platform to share their experiences with climate change. The result was overwhelming. Madelena from Kenya spoke about the devastating effects of shifting weather patterns on her farming town. Elizabeth from Tanzania urged action to help her community better prepare for flash flooding. Tyabe from Pakistan warned about the increasing threat of water shortages in his city.

Together with others, their voices formed a rallying cry from the world’s youth — one that demanded action for the planet.

And yet, for too long, the voices of many of these citizen advocates have been ignored and misrepresented on the global stage by local elites, international leaders and even by advocates and activists in the Global North who too often centred their own perspectives when it came to organising and storytelling.

Central to one of the most common narratives we hear, often drowning out all the other stories, is the perception that action on climate change must be a zero-sum game. Too many feel it is a war in which there will inevitably be winners and losers. There are those, primarily in the Global North, who argue the whole world must all move at the same accelerated pace to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Implicit in such assertions is that the development needs, hopes, dreams and aspirations of billions of people in poorer communities is of secondary concern. In effect, these people say to others: “Yes, it is a shame you will not be able to lift people out of poverty in the same way we did, but at least we will keep the planet from burning.”

At the same time, there are some political leaders who cynically exploit such assertions as an excuse for little action and who don’t show up at the negotiating table. After all, it is said, why should they? They are not responsible for the present crisis, so why should the aspirations and needs of their people be relegated to the back seat?

Yet such winner-takes-all equations form just one narrative; one that implies young people should put their concerns in life on hold to tackle climate change. Unsurprisingly, this is out of touch with — and does not speak to nor reflect — the views and stories of many youth in developed and emerging countries.

Put simply: a climate narrative focused on limits to economic growth and future pessimism is fundamentally disconnected from their aspirations and values. Neither does it reflect the huge economic opportunities climate action presents, which many young people are among the biggest proponents of.

A global survey by research agency Glocalities in 2021 highlights how youth in developing regions have similar high concerns about climate change as those in developed regions. Sixty-four percent of youth from developing regions are strongly concerned about climate change. Yes, their worries about climate change go together with similarly high concerns about poverty, corruption, quality education, and gender equality. And they are twice more concerned about unemployment than they are about climate change.

Overall, the research from Glocalities highlights that contrary to the pessimistic presentation of climate action as a zero-sum economic game by many of their leaders, young people in developing regions tend to be much more positive about their future. Bringing to the fore narratives and stories that speak to this alternative outlook could provide a way to finally move beyond the predominantly polarising tone of the so-called climate wars. It would serve as a catalyst for connecting to and mobilising, in huge numbers, a new generation of climate advocates capable of demonstrating to leaders the existence of an overwhelming pro-climate constituency impatient for change.

Core to this alternative narrative is that climate action can only be concerned with both the welfare of our planet and the future of our children; the two are not mutually exclusive. The solution to the climate crisis will undoubtedly create new opportunities to improve the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of one’s community, creating new jobs and economic opportunities, transforming and improving cities, clean air, supporting families and ultimately raising living standards using new technologies.

Data backs these opportunities up. Renewable energy currently creates five times more jobs than fossil fuels. And, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the number of renewable energy jobs grew from 1.7 million in 2004, to 10.3 million in 2017, and 11.5 million in 2019. So-called just energy transition deals are already being set up to enable particular willing countries to shore up the finance needed to do the jump while protecting their peoples’ welfare. It is happening in South Africa and this example should be replicated many times more.

Viewed in this vein, action on climate change is an integral part of the broader programme of societal and economic change, transition and transformation that young people are hoping their leaders deliver on. It is an enabler, not just to avoid climate disaster, but to fastrack ending poverty altogether. This is the story that needs to be told, indeed is being told and needs to be amplified to a wider audience.

It is a sentiment that was eloquently put forth by Brianna Fruean, a young Pioneering Climate campaigner from Samoa and a recipient of the 2022 Global Citizen Prize: Citizen Award. Receiving her prize last month at the Global Prize dinner in New York, Brianna shared her optimistic view that the climate crisis need not be the end, but the beginning, in her words, “of an environmental renaissance that serves as a refresh for humanity”. A refresh that consists of transformative action that brings together everyone: from those communities on the frontlines, to those workers affected in the great energy transition to come.

There are plenty more stories like Brianna’s already being told as a counterpoint to the prevailing pessimistic and antagonistic narratives that tend to dominate global climate discussions. But they need a larger stage to cut through at COP27 in Egypt, G20 in Bali, G7 in Germany and equally important, at home. A citizens conference on global governance that creates space for these stories to be told and disseminated among the highest levels could definitely help.

In the end, the surfacing and promotion of alternative narratives and stories on climate action may not only provide the basis for energising new constituencies and movements of climate advocates in communities around the world. It would also prevent the cynical appropriation of young peoples’ aspirations as an excuse for inaction on climate change by putting to bed the myth they do not care. And, provided they can be forced to listen to new stories, leaders might finally recognise that they do have a cross-border mandate to move beyond the climate wars of the past, and take urgent action now.

Why sustainability reporting is vital to tackling climate change,"Expectations of the purpose of business, as well as how companies operate and deliver is evolving.

The Forum understands the challenges they face and supports progress on convergent sustainability reporting standards.

The lack of a universal sustainability reporting standard poses an obstacle to measuring the sustainability of business and tackling climate change.

Ten years ago did you consider which bank you used based on its green credentials, did you know anyone who was vegan, did it matter to you whether the company you worked for had a green ethos, and were your children learning about recycling, reuse and ecosystems in school? Possibly not, but odds are you do now.

In an era where conscious choices are being made about the environmental viability of every aspect of our lives, sustainability touches everyone and everything. It has to: an increasing number of the conditions necessary to human life as we know it are disappearing, and we now recognize that we’re responsible for this situation.

People care and green consciousness is growing

Fortunately, people care – and increasingly so. Yes, there are many other issues high on boardroom, policy and consumer agendas – whether it’s conflict in Ukraine, rising energy prices or the continued fallout of COVID-19 – but a sustainability mindset has taken hold and environmental literacy is stronger than ever, blazing an irreversible trend.

This has transformational repercussions for business; those companies that embrace sustainability as an integral part of their operating model are seeing their value increase. This is not just in terms of profits, but also in higher staff retention and engagement, greater customer loyalty, and improved access to markets and funding. With this shift towards sustainability come improving examples of best practice, better short, medium and long-term targets and regulation.

How to report sustainability

This amorphous trend requires the discipline of standardization and regulation. One area in which the World Economic Forum is particularly active is standardized sustainability reporting. Let’s be honest, this isn’t an exciting-sounding subject, but it is essential to progress in supporting everyday sustainability and ultimately its success.

Do you remember measuring your height as a child? That pencil mark on the wall or chart that progressively marched upwards, maybe with a date attached. You could measure your progress because you had a tool, in this case a tape measure, and a standard, either feet and inches or centimetres and metres. Measuring sustainability is no different, and for companies, it’s this type of yardstick that is needed not just to measure and compare progress, but also to hold themselves, and others accountable in meeting their climate-related targets.

Think of corporate accounting and its two major systems of measurement – the US GAAP and the IFRS – both of which offer a commonly-understood, legitimate, verifiable approach that extends across borders and jurisdictions. That’s what we are working towards; a globally-recognized, and importantly, comparable system that meaningfully measures how sustainable a business is.

Environment How is the World Economic Forum fighting the climate crisis? Our planet is straining under the burden of a global population of nearly 8 billion people.



The World Economic Forum’s Centre for Nature and Climate accelerates actions on climate change and environmental sustainability, food systems, the circular economy and value chains, and the future of international development. Through the Global Plastic Action Partnership, we are bringing together government, business and civil society to shape a more sustainable world through the eradication of plastic pollution.

The centre is championing Nature-Based Solutions. Global companies are working together through the 1t.org initiative to support 1 trillion trees by 2030. Since September 2021, over 30 companies have committed to conserve, restore and grow more than 3.6 billion trees in over 60 countries.

Through a partnership with the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and over 30 global businesses, the Forum is encouraging companies to join the First Movers Coalition and invest in innovative green technologies so they are available for massive scale-up by 2030 to enable net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.

The centre is also bringing leaders together to make commitments to a circular economy approach. Globally, the Scale360° initiative will reduce the environmental impact of value chains within the fashion, food, plastics and electronics industries – a significant step in making the $4.5 trillion circular economy opportunity a reality. The African Circular Economy Alliance is funding circular economy entrepreneurs and circular economy activities in countries including Rwanda, Nigeria and South Africa. In China, the Forum's Circular Electronics in China project is helping companies reduce and recycle 50% of e-waste by 2025.

The Forum is also crowdsourcing solutions to the climate crisis through its open innovation platform, UpLink. Since 2020 this digital space has welcomed over 40,000 users who are working on over 30 challenges including reducing plastic ocean pollution, scaling efforts to conserve, restore and grow 1 trillion trees and innovating the production and processing of aquatic foods. Contact us for more information on how to get involved.



What does a sustainable business look like?

Businesses are facing increasing pressure to deliver prosperity sustainably. We aren’t just talking about the impact a business, its operations and workforce have on the environment, but also its resiliency. A business that manages risks (including climate change) and disruptions well is regarded as resilient. This makes sustainability information critical to businesses and gets to the heart of understanding how they create or erode value.

That growing green consciousness mentioned earlier is integral to this. Businesses that fail to shift to a sustainable operating model will see their customer base shrink, fall behind in terms of technology, face tighter regulations, find it harder to compete and struggle when economic conditions are difficult.

The World Economic Forum doesn’t offer a solution; it accelerates progress towards one

The Forum is ideally placed to understand the short and longer-term challenges that businesses and different sectors face, and is helping shape the ecosystem and streamline the processes required for transformation.

On its platform, the Forum hosts a large and growing coalition of companies that are driving the sustainability agenda, and through its convening power, enables stakeholders to navigate the investment sphere.

In terms of sustainability reporting, the Forum is a strong advocate of convergence. Since 2019, it has been working with the Big Four accounting firms and consulted with more than 200 companies to produce the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics (SCM). These offer a universal means for companies to report on their sustainability, and already more than 150 companies are using the SCM to chart their progress in meeting green targets, producing crucial, comparable data.

The metrics have been organized into four pillars – Principles of Governance, Planet, People and Prosperity – which are aligned with the essential elements of the SDGs Image: World Economic Forum

This work has resulted in a coalition of CEOs who support progress on convergent sustainability reporting standards. In turn, this is providing the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) – which falls under the purview of the IFRS – with a sounding board for its work in creating a universally accepted sustainability reporting standard.

Measuring and managing sustainability

We know what we value – in this case a healthy and sustainable planet – and as such, understand that the impact we are having on it needs to be measured and managed.

New Zealand considers taxing cow and sheep burps to combat climate change,"The government of New Zealand has proposed a novel way of fighting climate change: charging farmers for the burps, farts and waste of farm animals.

New Zealand is a progressive, eco-friendly country, but also a land where sheep and cattle both outnumber people.

Sheep, cows and other livestock contribute to climate change in various ways, including by grazing on land that was clear-cut to make room for them and by eating grains grown where forest once stood. But they also create planet-warming emissions directly, as a byproduct of their digestion, which releases methane — a powerful greenhouse gas.

So, as part of a system of selling tradable emissions credits, New Zealand wants to require ranchers to buy credits for the methane their livestock produce.

""There is no question that we need to cut the amount of methane we are putting into the atmosphere, and an effective emissions pricing system for agriculture will play a key part in how we achieve that,"" James Shaw, New Zealand's climate change minister, told BBC News last week.

Methane is the second-most prevalent greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, and the majority of methane emissions come from human activity. Since methane causes much more warming than carbon in the first few decades after it is released, but then dissipates in the atmosphere more quickly, clamping down on methane emissions is essential to averting catastrophic climate change, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. President Biden and the European Union unveiled a global effort to cut methane emissions at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, last November.

Contrary to endless Republican jokes about how Democrats want to ban cow farts, burps are actually the more widespread issue for climate change. As WebMD, which cleverly labeled the New Zealand plan “an animal gas tax,” explains, cows and sheep have stomachs with separate compartments, one of which, known as the rumen chamber, is filled with microbes that break down the plants they eat. That process produces carbon dioxide and methane, which they burp out into the atmosphere.

“Cows are pretty disgusting eaters, with methane coming from both ends,” Christopher Field of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, told the Associated Press in 2019. “But most of it comes from burping.”

According to an estimate cited by the Associated Press, “methane emitted by ruminant livestock accounts for about 5.5% of the greenhouse gases that come from human activity.” The total greenhouse gas emissions from all livestock — including manure storage, transportation and so on — accounts for 14.5% of all global emissions, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization.

New Zealand’s burp tax would take effect in 2025, and it would also provide farmers with subsidies to switch their livestock to a special diet that avoids creating greenhouse gases, such as feeding them seaweed instead of grass or grain, or to offset the emissions by planting trees. The country will also pour money into research that could advance other technological fixes, such as outfitting animals with masks that capture their emissions, or selectively breeding cows that burp less.

Even New Zealand’s farm industry is supportive.

""We've been working with the government and other organizations on this for years to get an approach that won't shut down farming in New Zealand, so we've signed off on a lot of stuff we're happy with,” Andrew Hoggard, a dairy farmer and the national president of Federated Farmers of New Zealand, told the BBC.

"Heatwaves to become more frequent, longer and hotter due to climate change","Heatwaves like the one engulfing parts of Europe and the US will start earlier, become more frequent, and will be longer and hotter because of climate change, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has warned.

The likes of Spain and France are experiencing intense heat in patterns rarely seen this early in the year, while nearly a third of the American population is under some form of heat advisory, it said.

""Although it is only mid-June, temperatures are more typical of those witnessed in July or August. The ongoing episodes follow a prolonged heatwave in India and Pakistan in March and April.

""As a result of climate change, heatwaves are starting earlier and are becoming more frequent and more severe because of record concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases,"" the WMO said.

People living in cities are even more vulnerable, according to its experts. ""City dwellers are particularly susceptible because of the so-called urban heat island effect which magnifies heat impacts compared to the countryside where there is more vegetation,"" the WMO said.

According to the website Science Direct, so-called ""heat islands"" are urban or metropolitan areas that are significantly warmer than their surrounding rural areas due to human activities.

The UN advised in November last year that the world’s cities are warming at twice the global average rate.

The energy requirement for space cooling is predicted to triple from 2016 to 2050 as millions of households in developing countries acquire air conditioners in the coming decades, the UN's Environment Programme warned.

Overheated cities face disproportionate climate costs due to ‘heat island effect’ and the average city could warm as much as 4°C by 2100, it added. Similarly, the Red Cross warned in a report on heat islands in 2019 that ""the urban poor frequently bear the brunt of this silent emergency"".

It said:

In addition to threatening the lives and health of vulnerable populations, heatwaves have cascading impacts in other areas of society, such as reduced economic output, strained health systems and rolling power outages.

In relation to the current heatwaves, which have seen Irish holidaymakers caught up in ferocious temperatures unfamiliar to even the most heat-hardened, the Red Cross said simple measures could be taken to avoid serious health implications.

“Due to climate change, heat waves are on the rise globally — getting both hotter and longer. But they don't need to lead to tragedy. There are simple actions we can all take to protect ourselves, our neighbours, our family members and friends.

""These include drinking water, resting in the shade, and avoiding outdoor activity in the hottest part of the day,” said Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).",,[],"['Pádraig Hoare', 'Wed', 'Jun']"
"'We beg God for water': Chilean lake turns to desert, sounding climate change alarm","PENUELAS, Chile, June 13 (Reuters) - The Penuelas reservoir in central Chile was until twenty years ago the main source of water for the city of Valparaiso, holding enough water for 38,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. Water for only two pools now remains.

A huge expanse of dried and cracked earth that was once the lake bed is littered with fish skeletons and desperate animals searching for water.

Amid an historic 13-year drought, rainfall levels have slumped in this South American nation that hugs the continent's Pacific coast. Higher air temperatures have meant snow in the Andes, once a key store of meltwater for spring and summer, is not compacting, melts faster, or turns straight to vapor.

The drought has hit mine output in the world's largest copper producer, stoked tensions over water use for lithium and farming, and led capital Santiago to make unprecedented plans for potential water rationing.

""We have to beg God to send us water,"" said Amanda Carrasco, a 54-year-old who lives near the Penuelas reservoir and recalls line fishing in the waters for local pejerrey fish. ""I've never seen it like this. There's been less water before, but not like now.""

The reservoir needs rainfall - once reliable in winter but now at historic lows, said Jose Luis Murillo, general manager of ESVAL, the company that supplies Valparaiso with water.

""Basically what we have is just a puddle,"" he said, adding that the city now relied on rivers. ""This is especially significant if you think that several decades ago the Penuelas reservoir was the only source of water for all greater Valparaiso.""

Behind the issue, academic studies have found, is a global shift in climate patterns sharpening natural weather cycles.

Normally, low-pressure storms from the Pacific unload precipitation over Chile in winter, recharging aquifers and packing the Andes mountains with snow.

But naturally occurring warming of the sea off Chile's coast, which blocks storms from arriving, has been intensified by rising global sea temperature, according to a global study on sea temperature and rainfall deficits. Ozone depletion and greenhouse gasses in the Antarctic, meanwhile, exacerbate weather patterns that draw storms away from Chile, according to a study on variables affecting Antarctic weather.

'WATER TOWERS'

Analysis of tree rings going back 400 years shows how rare the current drought is, said Duncan Christie, a researcher at the Center for Climate and Resilience in Chile. It is totally unrivalled for duration or intensity.

He said that meant the Andes - which he called the country's ""water towers"" - were not getting a chance to replenish, which in turn meant that as snow melted in spring there was far less water to fill rivers, reservoirs and aquifers.

Miguel Lagos, a civil engineer and water specialist, traveled to measure snow cover near the Laguna Negra station in central Chile some 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of Santiago - part of a process to estimate summer water supply.

""There was just nothing,"" he told Reuters. ""There were so few precipitation events and such warm conditions that the snow melted that same winter.""

As snow compacts, creating new layers, this helps keep it colder for longer. But with warmer weather and less snowfall, Lagos said, top layers of snow were melting faster or turning straight to vapor, a process called sublimation.

A 2019 study in the International Journal of Climatology that analyzed Chile's drought from 2010 to 2018 said shifting weather events could ease the drought in future, but much would depend on the trajectory of human emissions impacting climate.

Segundo Aballay, an animal breeder in the Chilean village of Montenegro, is praying change comes soon.

""If it doesn't rain this year we will be left with nothing to do,"" he said. ""The animals are getting weaker and dying day by day.""

Unfortunately for agriculture workers like Aballay, researchers at the University of Chile predict the country will have 30% less water over the next 30 years, based on mathematical models and historic data.

""What we call a drought today will become normal,"" Lagos said.

In the Laguna de Aculeo, another dried up lake south of Santiago, local campsite manager Francisco Martinez recalled hundreds of people coming to the area to take out kayaks or swim in the waters.

Now rusting piers and old boats sit in the barren landscape. An eerie island in the middle of what was once water rises up above the dust.

""Now there is no water, it is a desert here,"" Martinez told Reuters. ""The animals are dying and there is nothing to do here in the lagoon any more.""

"Climate change: Biggest methane gas leak occurred at Russian coalmine, say reports","The biggest leak of methane gas in the world seems to have occurred at a coalmine in Russia, media reports said citing satellite data. This comes as the world is looking to take measures to cut emissions to keep a check on climate change. In January, around 90 tonnes of methane gas were released per hour from the Raspadskaya mine in Kemerovo Oblast. It is the largest coalmine in Russia. The release is enough to run around five coal-fired power stations. If this amount of gas could have been used for the whole year, it would have been enough to power 2.4 million homes.

The gas leak was first traced to the source in January, as per GHGSat data. It is a Canada-based commercial satellite monitoring company. The firm believes that this is the biggest leak ever traced to a single source.

Around 13 distinct methane plumes were measured from the mine. They had ranged in size from 658 to 17,994 kg per hour, GHGSat said.

“We are seeing an increase in methane from this site generally, which could be the result of increased coal production, linked to global trends in coal use,” said Brody Wight, director of energy, landfill and mines at GHGSat.

Metaspectral takes vision for fighting climate change out of this world with help from space agency,"Metaspectral takes vision for fighting climate change out of this world with help from space agency

Vancouver-based computer vision firm Metaspectral will be measuring CO2 levels using data and images captured by orbiting satellites | Roberto Machado Noa / Getty Images

Francis Doumet would like to think he has his eye on helping the environment.

The fight against “climate change is obviously very, very dear to our hearts,” said the CEO of MLVX Technologies Inc. (Metaspectral), whose Vancouver company specializes in computer vision software that helps computers see and perceive the world as humans do.

Data interpreted by Metaspectral’s software is so precise that a major plastics recycler is working with the B.C. company to help with visually identifying the different types of plastics coming into their plants based on the materials they’re made from.

“We can increase the sorting capability, and therefore increase the quality of the recycled material and increase the impact of the circular economy,” Doumet said.

Metaspectral is now taking its vision for effecting environmental change off this world with a little help from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).

The company revealed Tuesday the CSA is providing it with $150,000 in funding for an initiative aimed at measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on planet Earth by examining hyperspectral images and data captured by orbiting satellites.

While many computer vision applications rely on conventional pictures to identify images of dogs or trees, Metaspectral taps high-end, hyperspectral sensors to collect mountains of data that its software can then analyze pixel by pixel in real time.

“Conventional computer vision … basically [sees] what humans can see. But there’s a lot that goes beyond the human eye that conventional cameras cannot capture. And that's where our technology ventures into,” Doumet said, adding that those high-end sensors collect 300 frequencies of light compared with the three frequencies of light captured by typical cameras.

“That allows us to find defects, characteristics, and identify materials that conventional cameras, and therefore conventional computer vision, simply cannot find.”

The data collected for the space-bound venture comes from across the electromagnetic spectrum to allow Metaspectral’s software to identify and measure CO2. This means measuring how different frequencies of light invisible to the human eye reflect back to the sensor and then comparing it to previous measurements.

The company said that it’s able to accurately measure this within a three per cent margin of error.

“One of the key problems today with the whole carbon credit system is that farmers in general just have a have a hard time kind of defining exactly what their impact is,” Doumet said.

“And so if we were able to take out the guessing game, at least when it comes to accurately measuring the carbon sequestration potential of … a farmer's field, then that empowers them to kind of plug into the carbon credit system more efficiently.”

Another B.C.-based firm is trying to address the same problem, albeit in a much different manner.

No market for purchasing carbon credits based on carbon sequestration in the soil currently exists in Canada. In the U.S., the market leans heavily on best estimates based on initiatives deployed by farmers, such as the growth of cover crops or soil-tilling practices.

Last year Vancouver-based Terramera Inc. landed $7.9 million in funding from Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) to pursue technology that can better quantify carbon within farm soil without the reliance on expensive labour and lab work currently needed.

“The key thing that we've always been looking at is how do we start incenting that behavior,” Terramera CEO Karn Manhas told BIV in May 2021.

“We've developed a scalable, accurate, low-cost remote sensing technology where we actually have sensors and data pulled out of the field.”

Meanwhile, Doumet said Metaspectral’s technology also has direct agricultural applications, such as visually identifying plants that are sick vs. plants that are healthy.

“And there are also obvious applications in defense. For example, [detecting] a camouflage vehicle sitting under a canopy of trees,” he said.

Doumet said customers come from wide spectrum of industries but they all have one thing in common.

“They are typically customers that have already experimented with computer vision,” he said.

“Our customers don't necessarily come in asking for these hyperspectral sensors that we're talking about. They basically come in with a computer vision problem and we provide a different approach to solving their problems.”

Climate Change and Health Equity: Key Questions and Answers,"Introduction

Over the past few years, a plethora of research has come out linking climate change to adverse health outcomes around the world. In 2021, a worldwide group of medical research professionals suggested that rising temperatures associated with climate change was the greatest threat to global public health. Illustrating the growing potential consequences of climate change, 2021 marked some of the most frequent extreme and costly climate events in the United States in the past decade. Climate and climate change related health risks disproportionately impact historically marginalized and under-resourced groups, who have the least resources to prepare for and recover from these disasters. As climate-related events become more common, the impacts on health and health care will increase in both frequency and intensity. This brief provides an overview of the impact of climate and climate change on health, identifies who is at increased risk for negative health impacts associated with climate and climate change, explains why there is a growing focus on climate change and health, and reviews recent federal efforts to address climate change and health equity.

How Do Climate and Climate Change Affect Health?

Climate and weather can negatively impact individual and population-level health through multiple pathways. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that different climate drivers, including increasing temperatures, precipitation extremes, extreme weather, and rising sea levels, affect health through a range of exposure pathways, including extreme heat, poor air quality, reduced food and water quality, changes in infectious agents, and population displacement (Figure 1). These exposures may lead to negative health outcomes such as heat-related and cardiopulmonary illnesses; food-, water-, and vector-borne diseases, and worsened mental health and stress.

Climate-related health threats are expected to increase going forward. For example:

Climate change has caused longer, more frequent, and more intense heat waves, which are likely to result in more heat-related illnesses and deaths . Studies have found that exposure to extreme heat makes people sick and may also cause death. In the United States, more than 65,000 people visit the emergency room for heat-related stress and approximately 702 people die from heat exposure each year.

Studies have found that exposure to extreme heat makes people sick and may also cause death. In the United States, more than 65,000 people visit the emergency room for heat-related stress and approximately 702 people die from heat exposure each year. Increasingly frequent extreme weather events due to climate change cause direct loss of life and negatively impact health through the damage they cause. Over the past twenty years, major storms such as hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Sandy, Harvey, and Maria, have resulted in massive loss of life and billions of dollars of damage. In addition to the immediate hazards created by the storms, the flooding and damage they cause to infrastructure can lead to the spread of waterborne diseases and contamination from industrial and agricultural waste runoff; compromise emergency response efforts; limit access to basic needs, including food, water, and housing; and disrupt access to health care and prescription medications. For example, in a survey of Katrina evacuees in Houston shelters, KFF found that, immediately after the hurricane, 25% of evacuees reported going without needed medical care and about a third (32%) went without their needed prescription medicines. Moreover, impacts extend beyond the immediate aftermath of storms. KFF survey data of New Orleans residents one year after Hurricane Katrina found that 32% said their life remained “very disrupted” or “somewhat disrupted” by the storm, with this share rising to 59% of African American residents in Orleans Parish. More than a third (36%) of those living in the Greater New Orleans area reported their access to health care deteriorated since the storm, 19% reported declines in their physical health, and 16% reported deterioration in their mental health. Ten years after the storm, KFF survey data of New Orleans residents who lived in the area during Katrina reported lingering mental health effects, including problems sleeping. In Puerto Rico, there was an excess mortality of 2,975 deaths as a result of Hurricane Maria. KFF interviews with Puerto Ricans two months after Hurricane Maria found that participants were continuing to face challenges meeting basic needs, and daily life remained challenging due to lack of electricity. In a KFF survey of Puerto Ricans one year after the storm, a quarter said their lives were still somewhat or very disrupted and about a quarter said they or a household member had a new or worsened health condition since the storm.

In a KFF survey of Puerto Ricans one year after the storm, a quarter said their lives were still somewhat or very disrupted and about a quarter said they or a household member had a new or worsened health condition since the storm. Worsening air quality also may negatively impact health in a variety of ways. Research suggests that climate change may contribute to increases in particulate matter and ground-level ozone—key components of smog and harmful air pollutants. The CDC notes that prolonged exposure to ozone can lead to worse lung function, an increase in cardiovascular- and respiratory-related hospital visits and admissions, and an increase in premature deaths. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicts that global annual health care costs associated with air pollution will increase from $21 billion in 2015 to $176 billion in 2060. Increases in wildfires due to changes in rain patterns and warmer summers may worsen air quality through the emission of particulate matter and other ozone-forming gases in smoke, which contribute to increased incidences of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. Moreover, longer and more intense pollen seasons stemming from longer warmer periods and increased carbon dioxide concentrations may negatively impact respiratory health, particularly for allergy and asthma sufferers. The CDC reports that medical costs associated with pollen exceed $3 billion each year and result in fewer productive work and school days.

Who is at Increased Risk for Negative Health Impacts Due to Climate and Climate Change?

While climate change poses health threats for everyone, people of color, low-income people, and other marginalized or high-need groups face disproportionate risks due to underlying inequities and structural racism and discrimination. The same factors that contribute to health inequities influence climate vulnerability— the degree to which people or communities are at risk of experiencing the negative impacts of climate change.

People of color face increased climate-related health risks compared to their White counterparts. As a result of historic and contemporary structural racism and discrimination, people of color are more likely to live in poverty; be exposed to environmental hazards; and have less access to health, economic, and social resources; making them more at risk for negative health impacts due to climate compared to their White counterparts. Last year, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that racial and ethnic minorities were most likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in morbidity and mortality due to climate related changes in temperatures and air pollution. They were more likely to lose labor hours and opportunities due to increases in high-temperature days. They were also the most likely to live in areas with projected land loss due to sea level change, as well as live in coastal areas with the highest projected increases in traffic delays due to high-tide flooding. For example:

Historical policies such as redlining have led to residential segregation of Black people into urban neighborhoods that increase their exposure to extreme heat and poor air quality. Black people are 40% and 34% more likely than all other demographic groups to live in areas with the highest projected increases in extreme temperature-related deaths and the highest projected increases in childhood asthma diagnoses, respectively. Black people are also 41 to 60% more likely than non-Black people to live in areas with the highest projected increases in premature death due to exposure to harmful particulate matter. The disproportionate exposure to extreme heat and poor air quality increases their risk of premature mortality.

Black people are also 41 to 60% more likely than non-Black people to live in areas with the highest projected increases in premature death due to exposure to harmful particulate matter. The disproportionate exposure to extreme heat and poor air quality increases their risk of premature mortality. Similarly, Hispanic people are 21% more likely to live in the hottest parts of cities, yet 30% of them do not have access to air-conditioning and are susceptible to the adverse outcomes associated with heat exposure. Additionally, they make up nearly half of agricultural workers and 28% of construction workers in the United States, among whom heat related illnesses are very common. Overall, Hispanic people are more than three times as likely to die from heat-related illnesses than non-Hispanic White people. Residential exposure to pesticides may also increase health risks. For example, in California, higher exposure to pesticides is associated with increased rates of testicular germ cell cancer, particularly among Latino people. Further, in the events of extreme weather, Hispanic people with limited English proficiency may be at increased risk due to lack of linguistically accessible information. For example, during a 2013 flash flood event an only Spanish-speaking family in Oklahoma missed warnings of severe flash floods and died while taking refuge from a tornado in a drainage ditch.

For example, during a 2013 flash flood event an only Spanish-speaking family in Oklahoma missed warnings of severe flash floods and died while taking refuge from a tornado in a drainage ditch. Asian and Pacific Islander people are more likely to live in areas that are at a disproportionate risk of being excluded from adaptation measures that could mitigate the impacts of high-tide flooding-related traffic delays compared to non-Asian people and non-Pacific Islanders. U.S. colonial and military activity have also created legacies of environmental pollution in U.S. territories, including those in the Pacific Islands. In a recent study, researchers found that a majority of EPA violations on the islands occurred at or were associated with U.S. military sites. For example, Anderson Air Force Base in Guam which was placed on the National Priority List (NPL) due to the presence of hazardous materials is located above an aquifer that provides drinking water to at least 70% of the island’s residents. In American Samoa, soil and ground water analyzed from a local elementary school was found to be contaminated with fuel compounds, lead, and other heavy metals from when the U.S. Navy stored petroleum fuel on and used the site as a military installation during World War II. Exposure to fuel compounds, lead, and heavy metals can be harmful to health.

Exposure to fuel compounds, lead, and heavy metals can be harmful to health. Historic land dispossession of American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) Tribal lands has relegated many AIAN people to land that is disproportionately exposed to climate change risks, including extreme heat, wildfires, and reduced precipitation. As the average global temperature increases and sea levels rise, Tribal lands are being disproportionately eaten away by coastal erosion. One Inuit Eskimo village in Alaska, Shishmaref, had to relocate its entire population due to the impacts of climate change-related coastal erosion. AIAN people also have less access to potable water and, due to droughts, have more limited ability to grow their traditional heirloom crops. In addition, many AIAN Tribal lands are considered food deserts and lack access to healthy store-bought food making them reliant on less nutritious, convenience food store options.

Immigrants in the U.S. also face increased climate-related risks due to structural inequities. Immigrants are more likely than U.S. born people to work in environmentally hazardous professions and live in congregate housing with limited access to heating or cooling infrastructures, making them more susceptible to climate-related health risks. Noncitizen immigrants make up more than four in ten of agricultural workers in the United States. Data shows that between the years 1991 to 2006, agricultural workers engaged in crop production died at a 20 times higher rate from heat-related illnesses compared to all U.S. workers. Noncitizen immigrants also are more likely than citizens to be poor, which may contribute to increased challenges responding to and recovering from extreme weather events. For example, in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, immigrants were more likely than U.S.-born residents to report losses in employment and income. While immigrants were less likely to experience home damage, among those that did, they were less likely to have applied for government disaster assistance. Nearly half (48%) of immigrants with home damage said they were worried seeking help would draw attention to their or their families’ immigration statuses.

Low-income communities are likely to be disproportionately affected by climate change. People with low socioeconomic status are more likely to live in fragile housing, be exposed to environmental hazards, and have more limited ability to prepare for or recover from extreme climate events. Low-income households are more likely to have high energy burdens, a recent study found that 25% of low-income households could not afford to pay an energy bill in the past year, and nearly 13% were unable to pay an energy bill in the past month. This inability to pay their bills increases their likelihood of having their utilities disconnected, which would increase their exposure to extreme weather and resultant adverse health outcomes. In the event of extreme flooding and other weather, residents of federally assisted housing are put at an increased risk of exposure to toxic waste and runoff due to proximity to hazardous waste sites. A 2020 analysis found that 70% of the country’s most hazardous waste sites are located within one mile of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-assisted housing developments. Low-income communities are also more likely to be adversely impacted by natural disasters and other climate-related emergencies. In interviews with low-income survivors of Hurricane Katrina, KFF found that many survivors also reported suffering from emotional and mental trauma, barriers to accessing care resulting in serious and persistent gaps in care, unstable living conditions, and severe financial concerns. Similarly, a KFF survey of Puerto Ricans one year after Hurricane Maria found that those with lower incomes were more likely than residents with higher incomes to report housing-related challenges, including major damage or destruction of their home and unsafe housing conditions.

Older adults are more sensitive to climate change due to a variety of age-related reasons, including decreased thermoregulation, and a higher burden of chronic disease and disabilities. Given their age-related health changes, lower concentrations of air pollution and smaller temperature changes may result in adverse reactions. Analysis of fee-for-service Medicare data found that short-term exposure to air pollution was associated with an increase in annual hospital admissions and inpatient and post-acute care costs. Older people are also more likely to live alone and be socially isolated, putting them at increased risks of missing extreme weather warnings and potentially unable to respond to weather disasters. Further, in the last forty years, the number of older adults living in coastal communities has increased by 89%, which in combination with rising sea levels may put them at additional risk of being negatively affected by coastal flooding.

Why is a Focus on Climate Change and Health of Growing Importance?

In recent years, there has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of adverse climate-related events, with the potential to worsen health outcomes and exacerbate health inequities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently released its sixth report on climate change, noting that the risk to human health is increased with every fractional increase in global temperature. In June 2021, the western United States experienced record-breaking heat waves, increasing the risk of heat-related injuries, droughts, and wildfires. In addition to extreme heat, the past five years recorded some historical storm activity, with 2020 being the second time in history that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) exceeded the 21-name Atlantic list of storms. Researchers predict that the Earth will continue to experience an increase in its mean temperature, weather variability, and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. A 2019 Government Accountability Office report found that the effects of climate change posed a threat to 60% of the hazardous waste sites known as Superfund sites in the country. In 2020, scientists reported that extreme coastal flooding would threaten more than 900 Superfund sites in the next 20 years. This could have detrimental impacts on nearby residents (primarily low-income and communities of color) by exposing them to toxic chemicals through flooding and runoff.

Changes in land use, increases in ambient temperature, and changes in weather patterns can impact the spread of infectious diseases. As temperature rise, scientists project changes in mosquito abundance and mosquito-borne disease spread, which could increase people’s exposure to dengue, zika, yellow fever, and other mosquito-borne diseases. In the past twenty years, the mosquitos that spread dengue fever in the United States increased by 8.2% in response to rapid temperature increases. Climate change-related temperature increases have also contributed to the expanded range of ticks, increasing the risk of contracting Lyme disease.

What are Current Federal Efforts to Address Climate Change and Health Equity?

While addressing climate change would require a massive and sustained effort, the Biden administration has identified addressing climate change as a priority and taken a range of actions focused on mitigating the impacts of climate change, including its impacts on health equity.

On January 27, 2021, President Biden announced an Executive order on tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, emphasizing the need for a government-wide approach to addressing the climate crisis, including centering climate change in all levels of policymaking. In response to Biden’s executive order, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) enacted its climate action plan, including the establishment of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE) to address climate change and health equity. The climate action plan includes building more resilient and adaptive health programs, increasing the responsiveness to climate crises, and developing climate-resilient grant policies at HHS. In addition, OCCHE is tasked with creating an Interagency Working Group to Decrease Risk of Climate Change to Children, the Elderly, People with Disabilities, and the Vulnerable and a biennial Health Care System Readiness Advisory Council.

The executive order committed to delivering at least 40 percent of overall benefits from federal investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities. This includes addressing the impact Superfund sites have on communities, the launch of the Communities Local Energy Action Program (Communities LEAP), which helps communities that the fossil fuel industry has historically impacted to develop locally-driven energy plans to reduce local air pollution, increase energy resilience, lower both utility costs and energy burdens. The U.S. Department of Energy launched a $9 million effort to help 15 underserved and frontline communities better assess their energy storage as a means of achieving energy resilience and reducing energy insecurity.

In October 2021 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed a rule to protect workers from extreme heat exposure in indoor and outdoor settings and set up a National Emphasis Program (NEP) on heat inspections. The comment period for the proposed rule concluded on January 26, 2022. OSHA launched the NEP for Outdoor and Indoor Heat-Related Hazards on April 8, 2022. The NEP is an enforcement program that seeks to identify and eliminate or reduce worker exposures to occupational heat-related illnesses and injuries in workplaces where heat hazards are prevalent. It would include inspections prioritizing heat-related interventions and inspections of work activities on days when the heat index surpasses 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It is an expansion of the agency’s current heat-related illness prevention initiatives

The federal government has also taken several actions to protect disproportionately affected populations from exposure to toxic chemicals. The EPA revoked the usage of certain dangerous chemicals, including chlorpyrifos- a pesticide that negatively impacts farmworkers and children. There are also cross-agency efforts underway to reduce pollution burdens and exposures, including lead exposure and asthma disparities in children of color.

Last year, FEMA announced grants and initiatives dedicated to advancing climate change adaptation and promoting risk reduction and community resilience across the country. These include developing a FEMA National Risk Index to identify locations most at risk for 18 natural hazards, adopting climate resilience building standards, and dedicating funding to support communities at risk of being affected by climate-related extreme weather events and other natural disasters. For example: the Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant programs, Flood Mitigation Assistance grant program, Individuals and Households Program, and other programs. Hazard mitigation strategies play key roles in preventing or minimizing the impacts of natural disasters on communities by investing in and supporting climate resilient infrastructure. In collaboration with public health experts, these programs can also facilitate addressing health concerns caused and exacerbated by disasters, including reducing lapses in health care access, addressing physical and mental health challenges, spread of communicable disease, and others.",,[],"['Nambi Ndugga', 'Samantha Artiga']"
BPF calls for ‘radical collaboration’ to address climate change,"The British Property Federation has launched an initiative to urge the industry to measure, reduce and report on its carbon emissions.

Designed to complement and support wider net zero initiatives, the BPF Net Zero Pledge asks members to:

Sign up by setting verifiable net zero carbon targets and plans

Share research, knowledge and insight on an open-source basis

Support each other and the wider industry to accelerate the transition to net zero

The BPF will launch a net zero network with an online knowledge hub where it will collect relevant resources. Members will also be able to share ideas and access events.

Alongside the knowledge hub, a mentorship programme is in the works for heads of sustainability to share their advice and support each other.

Guy Grainger, president of the BPF and JLL’s global head of sustainability & ESG, said that the industry needs “radical collaboration” to deliver net zero.

He added: “The onus is on every single organisation to commit to tackling the climate crisis.

“In the next 12 months during my presidency at the BPF, I want to see all of our members working together to start or accelerate their journey to net zero.”

With members ranging from developers and investors to agents, designers and lawyers, the BPF said it is “uniquely placed” to bring the industry together for change.

Melanie Leech, CEO of the BPF, said: “The built environment has a critical role in the UK reaching its net zero target by 2050. Currently responsible for up to 40% of emissions globally the industry needs to be at the forefront of innovation.

“Our membership is broad and diverse, with members at different stages of their journey to net zero. The Net Zero Pledge aims to bring members together to support each other and share resources in order effectively to tackle carbon emissions before or by 2050 at the very latest.”

BPF members can sign up to the pledge on the organisation’s website.",,[],[]
Climate change is eroding a precious resource: sleep,"Everyone knows the horrible feeling: A stuffy night, just a little too warm, leads to restless sleep, and then next morning, you feel like a slow, groggy shell of yourself.

That feeling isn’t just unpleasant. Years of research show that sleep deprivation can ramp up heart disease risk, intensify mood disorders, slow one’s ability to learn, and much more—problems with big personal, societal, and economic costs.

Now a new study links sleep loss—and by extension, all the problems that come with it—with climate change. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen found that ever-warmer nighttime temperatures, nudged higher by climate change, push bedtimes later and wake times earlier, costing us precious nighttime rest.

Sleepers tracked in the study, published last week in the journal One Earth, lost rest even in places where temperatures weren’t blazingly high, and had trouble adapting to even mildly challenging sleep temperatures. And sleep costs, the researchers warn, will rise as temperatures do, potentially costing sleepers—that is, all of us—an extra 13 to 15 days of poor sleep each year by the end of the century.

It’s a very clear example of how climate change is playing out in people’s everyday lives, experts say—not just in catastrophic ways like more droughts and flooding, but in small costs that add up. Sleep loss from climate change “is already happening, right now, not in the future but today,” says Kelton Minor, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the University of Copenhagen.

A matter of degrees

Minor and his colleagues looked at data collected worldwide between 2015 and 2017 from nearly 50,000 people's wristband activity trackers. The trackers recorded when those people fell asleep, woke up, and how they slept in between. Though the data were anonymized, the researchers could match sleepers' locations with location-specific climate data.

That let the researchers compare the sleep data with local outdoor temperatures—they had no information about indoor conditions, or whether air conditioning was in use. Because they were looking at continuous records of individual people, they could see how someone slept on a cool night in June versus a hot one a few days later, or how they reacted to an unseasonably warm February night.

The dataset was unique in that it didn’t rely on self-reports, which are known to be unreliable. It also spanned the world, while the few previous studies looking at the direct relationship between climate and sleep focused on just a few people, or just the United States.

What was more remarkable were the results. People slept most when outside temperatures were below 50°F (10°C). Above that threshold, their chances of sleeping less than seven hours went way up. Above 77°F (25°C), the losses accelerated. When outdoor nighttime temperatures topped 86°F (30°C), people lost an average of about 15 minutes a night.

That may not sound like a lot, but it’s “actually quite a big deal,” says Sara Mednick, a sleep researcher at the University of California, Irvine. First off, other scientific studies suggest that those 15 minutes likely come from the uber-valuable “slow wave” sleep stage, she theorizes. We only get about an hour of that type of sleep a night, so taking away 15 minutes—or even five—cuts a big chunk of restorative time.

The heat also hits some groups worse than others. The impacts grow with age: People over 70 are about twice as sensitive, the study found, losing about 30 minutes instead of 15 under similar heat pressures. Women are also affected more, losing about 25 percent more sleep than the average at warmer temperatures. (Wristband use skews toward wealthier people and men—so it’s likely that their results underestimate the impacts.)

And residents of lower- and middle-income countries suffer about three times as much disrupted sleep time as those from high-income ones—in part, perhaps, because of less access to air conditioning.

“This moves the effects of climate change out of the catastrophic and existential and shows how it affects us every day,” says Jamie Mullins, an environmental economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who was not involved in the research. “It’s going to cost us all in small ways that really add up.”

Bodies don’t adjust

Possibly more concerning, though, was another finding: People’s bodies didn’t seem to adjust to warmer sleeping temperatures—even if they lived in hot climates year-round, or even after they’d lived through a summer of hot-night exposure. Warmer-than-usual nights messed with their sleep no matter what.

“We don’t find evidence that people are adapting,” says Minor, at least at the physiological level.

That makes sense, he explains, given how tightly our bodies regulate their internal temperature. A few degrees too hot or cold and our organs start to function less well or shut down. Body temperature is one of the primary controls on sleep: Before bedtime, we shunt blood toward our extremities and cool our cores ever so slightly. Without that shift, sleep gets much harder to slip into.

Needing such tight control over our body temperature makes us less flexible in the face of worsening sleep conditions.

Already, human-caused climate change has warmed the planet by about 2°F (1.1°C) since the 1800s. But nights have warmed more than days in most parts of the world; in the U.S., summer nights have warmed twice as much as summer days.

“Before, nights would be a chance to cool the body down. But when [heat] is that chronic stressor, the body can’t cool down and recover—that’s a key piece hurting people’s health,” says Rupa Basu, a public health expert with California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.

The Copenhagen researchers estimated that warmer nights already cost sleepers about 44 hours of rest every year. There are also 11 extra days of “short sleep,” nights when sleepers get less than seven hours.

But as the planet heats further, those costs will increase. By the end of the century, sleepers could lose 50 hours per year if carbon emissions continue more or less on their current track.

“Humans are remarkably adaptive,” says Minor. “But there are real physical limits to adaptation that we need to be mindful of.” Hot sleep, his analysis shows, may be one of them.

A problematic solution

This is not a thing to take lightly, says Jose Guillermo Cedeno Laurent, an environmental health researcher at Harvard. He and his colleagues did an experiment at Harvard College during a 2016 heatwave. Students who slept in newer dorms with air conditioning did better on cognition tests in the following days than those living in older buildings “built for another climate,” says Cedeno Laurent.

“Even young, healthy people…are actually affected in a way that really matters to them—how they think,” he says.

His study points to one possible solution to climate-induced sleep deficits: getting lots more air conditioning in households worldwide. But that’s a huge economic and environmental challenge. AC costs a lot of energy and therefore money; a recent study shows that U.S. low-income households wait until temperatures are 5-7.5°F hotter before they turn on their cooling systems. And at the moment, AC actually warms the outdoor environment both globally, because most of the electricity for it comes from burning fossil fuels, and locally, because the excess heat sucked out of bedrooms gets dumped into the air outside.

To Cedeno Laurent, the links between sleep deprivation and poorer health, both physical and mental, are so well established that it’s unconscionable to ignore issues that can make them worse. Clarifying the link between climate and sleep makes it impossible to ignore our social responsibility to fix the cause of the problem, as well as its impacts.

“Obviously, the best solution is to stop climate change,” he says. “This is basically a human rights issue at this point.”",,[],"['Alejandra Borunda', 'Published May']"
"To survive climate change, coffee must embrace new and resilient beans","Placeholder while article actions load

The research team’s task was as lofty as the mountains they scaled in December 2018. Their mission? To find a coffee species not seen for nearly 70 years in Sierra Leone. The species, though lost to the wild, lived on in textbooks. Daniel Sarmu, a local researcher on the team, had searched from “field to field” for four years. If any peculiar plant caught his eye, he’d collect a sample, hoping it’d be the lost species. But each genetic test came back negative; the search carried onward.

Until the expedition in 2018, when researchers found one plant of Coffea stenophylla in the largely deforested Kasewe Hills.

The moment was bittersweet. To regrow the elusive species, they needed to cross this plant with another — but a second stenophylla plant was not in sight. A few days later, they ventured to Kambui Hills. After just an hour of hiking — a drop in the bucket compared with Sarmu’s four-year search — they uncovered 20 plants. At all life stages, stenophylla was flourishing: seedlings, saplings and trees.

“Then, we knew we had something to build upon in terms of rescuing the species,” recalls Jeremy Haggar, a researcher on the team and a professor of agroecology at the University of Greenwich.

One hundred twenty-four coffee species exist, but most coffee drinkers are only familiar with two: arabica and robusta. Arabica accounts for 60 percent of traded coffee annually, while robusta trails at 40 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, nearly 165 million bags of coffee are produced worldwide each year. But for the coffee industry to adjust to a warming climate, farmers will need to grow multiple coffee species in addition to those commonly enjoyed today. Species with climate resilience, remarkable flavor and scalability — such as stenophylla — are prime candidates.

Climate change has already caused ripples in the coffee industry. Brazil, the supplier of a third of the world’s coffee, recently experienced its worst frost in at least 40 years, driving prices higher. By 2050, coffee demand is forecast to triple — but the way coffee has been produced up to this point cannot be scaled to rise to that challenge.

“Even though you’ve got these two species which cover a range of climatic conditions, it’s really not going to be enough in terms of adapting to climate change,” explained Aaron Davis, the lead researcher on the study and a senior research leader at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

Upping coffee production is like building upon a feeble house of cards — arabica-growing hot spots will become too warm for the crop in the decades to come, shrinking yields of the foundational species we rely upon today. As temperatures rise, arabica may also lose its quality of taste historically lauded by specialty coffee circles.

“If we were talking about this 10 years ago, they would say, ‘We’ll find a more climate-resilient arabica,’ ” Davis said. Yet, developing a climate-resilient arabica calls for drastic measures such as breeding or genome editing. “We’ve done a lot of work in Ethiopia — we’ve surveyed a lot of wild populations, a lot of cultivated plants — and arabica is really fixed to its niche. It doesn’t have the required variation in its climatic plasticity to really deal with climate change.”

Stenophylla, the recently rediscovered species in Sierra Leone, can withstand heat that arabica cannot, growing at temperatures up to 11 degrees Fahrenheit higher. Since its rediscovery, scientists are investigating how to expedite its growth and augment its yield. Though stenophylla is far from being ready to export, progress is steady.

Stenophylla’s potential has excited Sierra Leone residents, including 28-year-old, self-taught coffee roaster Hannah Tarawally. Coffee production slowed in the wake of her country’s civil war, which ended in 2002. Determined to reconnect farmers to coffee markets, Tarawally founded the Freetown-based roaster Coffee Couriers, one of Sierra Leone’s first dedicated coffee shops.

Tarawally roasts a blend of robusta and arabica every two weeks. Stenophylla is not available to local roasters yet, but once it is, it will transform Tarawally’s line of work. Following the struggle to revitalize local coffee production in the war’s aftermath, Tarawally deemed stenophylla as a “savior” to her community.

“It’s going to grow the economy of our country, so we are very excited,” Tarawally shared.

But climate-resilient coffee only becomes a scalable solution if its taste is so exceptional it catapults demand. And when it does, it creates opportunities on the ground where the coffee is roasted. Tarawally expects demand for the new bean to soar given its unique taste.

Stenophylla balances fruity and floral flavors with notes of peach, blackcurrant, elderflower syrup and jasmine. The Specialty Coffee Association rates coffees on a 100-point scale; those that rise above 80 points are among specialty coffee’s highest ranks. Stenophylla scored 80.25 points, alluding to its prospect of being embraced by global markets. And if it is, Tarawally hopes to “create more employment for our youths, especially females” to match rising demand.

Another bean key to coffee’s climate adaptation is one that is in rotation now but has been historically underestimated: robusta.

Advertisement

In the past, robusta’s heavy flavors of oak and tobacco have excluded the bean from specialty coffee spaces, but its climate potential is creating opportunities to upend this deep-rooted perception.

Despite sensitivity to drought, robusta can tolerate higher temperatures than arabica. And unlike arabica, robusta is resistant to coffee leaf rust, a fungus-induced disease that has caused coffee yields to plummet globally for 150 years. The fungus’s spores, brown just like rust, blanket the tops of coffee leaves, blocking sunlight vital to its growth.

Robusta’s potential has captured the attention of 35-year-old entrepreneur Sahra Nguyen, who sells single-origin robusta via Nguyen Coffee Supply, the company she founded in 2018.

“When I was starting out, I really felt like I was going up against the entire industry because the entire industry was very, very explicit and open about upholding this narrative of ‘arabica is superior, robusta is inferior,’ ” Nguyen said.

Robusta is the tried and true bean of Vietnam, which produces about 20 percent of the world’s coffee supply, amounting to 30 million bags. All but a mere 3 million of these bags are robusta.

Nguyen Coffee Supply is the first specialty Vietnamese coffee company in the United States, and from its inception, Nguyen has amplified representation for Vietnamese coffee farmers. At the New York coffee convention in 2019, Nguyen Coffee Supply debuted Truegrit, their 100 percent single-origin robusta. They were the only roaster to do so.

“Probably 95 percent of the people who came up to us said, ‘I’ve actually never tried a single-origin robusta,’ ” Nguyen said. Even self-proclaimed “coffee snobs” confessed to Nguyen that they never knew robusta could taste this way.

Their glowing reviews fractured the industry’s long-lived narrative against robusta and signaled its potential to become a greater slice of the coffee market.

Haggar is optimistic that multiple beans will recalibrate coffee’s climate equation.

“Hopefully, we are going to end up with a more diversified offer of coffees from across four or five different species,” Haggar, the researcher, said. “Which will hopefully make coffee drinking more interesting — but also mean that we will have different sources of resilience to a changing climate.”

"With global warming intensifying, here are 10 ways you can fight climate change this summer","With global warming intensifying, here are 10 ways you can fight climate change this summer

In December of 2017, 196 countries signed the Paris Agreement. Through reducing carbon emissions, this agreement aims to limit this century's temperature increase to 2º C (3.6º F) at most, though it has 1.5º C (2.7º F) as a lower, more optimistic threshold. “[1.5º C] is an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,” said World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a recent statement.

A recent report found that there's a 50-50 chance we'll reach this lower threshold by 2026. “As long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise. And alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme,"" Taalas said.

This sounds bad, we know. While it could be cause for concern, it shouldn't be a reason to quit the fight to save our planet. If we do reach the threshold, it could only be a temporary increase. If it becomes permanent down the line, we could still work to keep it from rising even further. Summer is on the horizon and with the changing of seasons comes new ways to be environmentally conscious.

Put on your walking shoes

Free from the cold of winter and the allergies of spring, summer is when many find being outside a treat instead of a chore. Since the weather's so nice, why not give walking a try? According to the EPA, transportation makes up a vast majority of carbon emissions, so it's a good idea to cut back on your car rides where you can or try carpooling.

If you're looking to get your walk on, we recommend picking up a pair of New Balance shoes. The brand is known for its comfort across various foot shapes. We recommend the New Balance 993 because we found it to be comfortable, sturdy and versatile.

Ride a bike when a walk just won’t cut it

Walks are nice, but they're not always the most practical option for travel. When a walk just won't cut it and the jangle of your keys sounds like a siren song, there's one last line of defense to resist the call of the engine: riding a bike.

With many cities becoming more bike-friendly, it's a good time to give cycling a try. Like walking, bike-riding doesn't produce any carbon emissions. Biking is great for covering longer distances in a short amount of time. Unlike driving, walking and biking are good sources of cardio.

The Schwinn Discover Hybrid bike has rave reviews on Amazon that attest to it being worth its price. With a built-in luggage rack, the Discover is an excellent choice for commuting this summer.

Wear a bathing suit made from recycled materials

Nothing says “summer” quite like a day at the beach and thanks to Summersalt, you can catch some rays and waves while saving the environment.

That's because Summersalt swimwear is made and packaged from recycled materials. If that isn’t cool enough, then you should know that the fit of Summersalt's swimwear is backed by data—they took over 1 million body measurements to inform the swimwear’s structure and sizing to ensure an optimal fit for various body types. We tested the brand and came to love the Marina and Sidestroke one-piece designs.

Put on ocean-friendly sunscreen

If you're going to the beach, whether you tan or burn, you'll have to deal with the sun. You might not think twice about using your favorite sunscreen, but what if we told you that it could damage the environment? Octinoxate has been linked to coral reef damage, to the point of several coastal destinations banning sunscreens that use it as an ingredient. Since coral bleaching is one of the effects of global warming, using octinoxate-free sunscreen will help mitigate future damage.

While there are many eco-friendly sunscreen brands to choose from, we recommend Stream2Sea. We haven’t tested it ourselves, but reviewers rave about its effectiveness and affordable price. The sunscreen is somewhat thick, so apply it conservatively if you want to avoid “ghost face.”

Get Stream2Sea Biodegradable sunscreen from Amazon for $17.96

Use bug spray that keeps wildlife safe

As much as we think we love summer, terrifying, winged creatures of the night love it even more. You can lock your doors, you can close your windows, yet they always find a way to slip through to steal your blood. Bugs. We're talking about bugs.

Mosquitoes, horseflies and ticks are just a few insects that have an annoying penchant for biting. What's worse is that they can also spread nasty diseases. Naturally, you'll spray just about anything on yourself to them at bay.

Bug spray usually contains DEET, a chemical that may harm wildlife. That’s where essential oils come in handy. While most essential oils aren't FDA-approved for use as bug repellent, eucalyptus oil is. The oil from the plant smells extremely strong and unpleasant to bugs, keeping them away. Eucalyptus leaves are a koala bear’s favorite food, so rest assured that this spray is all-natural. If it's good enough for a cuddly koala, it's good enough for us!

Swap your meat for Beyond Meat

If you didn’t have much of a spring, it might finally be time to break out the grill. If you're grilling beef, however, you might want to think twice before turning those burners on. According to the EPA, agriculture makes up 11% of carbon emissions and raising livestock contributes to a large portion of this. The jury's in: beef isn't sustainable.

Problem: Beef tastes great and most alternatives simply don't cut it.

Solution: Beyond Meat.

Beyond Meat is a plant-based meat substitute that brings the texture and taste you love without the unsustainable practices of the meat industry. Even if you're not a vegetarian, Beyond Meat is a fun new way to spice up your next barbecue. It might even become your next favorite food.

Use a reusable bag for groceries

If you’re getting patties, you’ll need buns. You might need mustard, too. You might as well get seasoning. While you're at it, you should probably pick up some milk, too.

Next thing you know, you've gone through an entire grocery list. Whoops, it happens. Before you checkout, you might want to think twice about bagging your purchases with plastic bags (assuming you don't live in one of the eight states that have banned single-use bags. Plastic clogs many of our planet's waterways. What's worse, single-use plastic can't easily be recycled.

Reusable bags are much more eco-friendly. For the summer months (and all year long, really), we recommend insulated grocery bags. You wouldn't want your milk getting curdled in a hot car, would you?

Get the Insulated Reusable Grocery Bag from Amazon for $17.99

Drink from a reusable water bottle

In the summer months when dehydration is a bigger threat than ever, it's important to remember to drink lots of water. If you're cutting down on single-use plastics, then water bottles should be the next thing to go. Producing, transporting and disposing of these bottles creates a large carbon footprint compared to their weight.

Reusable water bottles are a more sustainable way to meet your water-drinking needs this summer. While there are many styles of water bottles to choose from, we recommend the Brita stainless steel filtered bottle. It really does it all — its steel insulation keeps water cool for up to 24 hours, it filters the taste of chlorine and unlike other steel water bottles, it fits easily in your hand.

Get the Brita Stainless Steel Filtered Water Bottle from Walmart for $24.99

Opt for a fan instead of the AC

Speaking of beating the heat, you'll want a way to cool off besides drinking water. For many people, this means buying and using air conditioning. But that uses a lot of electricity and therefore burns a lot of fossil fuel. We've compared fans and AC and found that part of what makes using a fan so effective when you’re feeling overheated is that a fan cools you down directly, instead of the whole room around you. Consider using a fan if you can stay close to the fan and if it's under 95º F outside. We recommend the Dreo tower fan for its 90-degree oscillation and many speed options. Plus, you can integrate it with Alexa and Google Home.

Get the Dreo tower fan from Amazon for $89.99

Charge your devices with a solar-powered battery

While we've spoken at length about all the ways that the sun can be a pain, it's important to remember that it can be a great help, too. So helpful in fact, that it's one of the best sources of renewable energy. If you're planning on powering a small device, such as a phone or tablet, why not take advantage of the extra sunlight by buying a tiny solar panel to help you do it? We recommend the ADDTOP solar power bank for its ability to charge two devices at once, water resistance and easy installation.

Stop telling kids that climate change will destroy their world,"My 5-year-old daughter is now old enough to read a lot of books and magazines aimed at children, and it’s given me a whole new perspective on the discourse wars over how we talk about climate change, conservation, and the future of the planet.

As I’ve written about before, climate change is going to be bad, and it will hold back humanity from thriving as much as we should this century. It will likely cause mass migration and displacement and extinctions of many species.

What it won’t do, however, is make the Earth unlivable, or even mean that our children live in a world poorer than the one we grew up in. As many climate scientists have been telling us, the world is a better place to live in — especially for people in lower-income countries — than it has ever been, and climate change isn’t going to make it as bad as it was even in 1950.

“I unequivocally reject, scientifically and personally, the notion that children are somehow doomed to an unhappy life,” Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at Columbia, told Ezra Klein in his column this week about overcoming climate despair.

Writing aimed at adults doesn’t always do the best job of striking a balance, though not everyone agrees on precisely what that balance is. Books like The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming, to my mind, do a reasonable job of describing some extreme scenarios that really are worth contemplating, but they still don’t add up to an uninhabitable Earth, or even one that’d be an awful place to live.

Yes, some things will be worse, but because of progress on many fronts in addressing extreme poverty and disease, as well as general economic growth, our kids’ lives will be better than our parents’ lives were.

This question matters because there’s a fierce debate among activists about whether more pessimistic messaging energizes people to fight climate change or causes them to despair, conclude the world is doomed, and tune out. But the messaging for adults is positively nuanced and optimistic compared to the presentation of climate change and other environmental challenges that gets passed on to kids.

What we’re telling our kids about climate change

As a parent, I think it’s essential to empower kids and pass along the message that the world will be in their hands, that they will have the power to solve its most pressing problems, and that there are lots of people already working on those problems who are eager for kids to learn, grow, and join us. Fighting climate change is part of that, and it’s important and worthwhile, but not because there will be no world for children to live in when they grow up.

Unfortunately, the latter message is the dominant one in Our House Is on Fire: Greta Thunberg’s Call to Save the Planet, a beautifully illustrated picture book aimed at ages 3-8.

“There might not be a world to live in when she grows up. What use is school without a future?” one page describes Thunberg as thinking. Even as a setup for Thunberg’s rise as an activist, I’m not thrilled about that message. Some kids might hear that and be inspired to speak before the United Nations, but most kids are going to hear that and be scared and disempowered.

That pessimistic message seems to be sinking in for the young. A 2021 study funded by the campaign and research group Avaaz polled 10,000 people between 16 and 25, and found that over half thought that humanity was “doomed” because of climate change.

“You see children saying things like ‘The world’s going to burn up, we’re all going to be dead in 20 years,’ and that’s pretty unlikely,” Susan Clayton, a conservation psychologist who studies how climate change affects mental health, told National Geographic in an article about kids and climate anxiety.

Clayton has some good advice on what to do with a climate-anxious child. But it’s worth pausing on her quote. Why do we see kids saying that? Because books, stories, and protest messaging aimed at them tell them that! There’s pessimism in the water around climate change, and kids often take that pessimism far more literally than adults do.

In some cases, it feels like adults are displacing our own frustration at political inaction on climate onto kids — and doing it by telling them things that aren’t true, and that they don’t have the perspective or context to take with the appropriate grain of salt.

The problem permeates advice about what kids can do about climate change, too.

I imagine the tendency of advice for kids about climate change to urge them to challenge their grownups, recycle, ride bikes, and attend protests is out of a well-intentioned urge to give them advice they can use right now. But I worry it sets them up for frustration, and is fundamentally not very honest about how they can solve climate change.

Kids who throw themselves wholeheartedly at those problems for their entire childhood, but who aren’t themselves Greta Thunberg, aren’t likely to get anywhere, and they won’t be positioned to get anywhere as an adult either.

The best way a 7-year-old can improve the world probably isn’t by pleading with adults. It’s by learning more and developing new skills that she’ll be able to directly bring to bear on problems like climate change when she gets older.

Raising a better future

When our daughter asks about environmental issues, I like to tell her that a few generations ago, there was smallpox, but some kids studied hard and grew up into grownups who fought to eradicate it. I tell her that there was leaded gasoline, but we learned it was bad and phased it out. I tell her that today there is climate change, and solving it is going to require new inventions and new ideas — and she can be the one to invent them.

I explain that if we had better batteries, then we could use solar for more of our power grid, so maybe she can learn how to invent better batteries. I explain that if we could grow beef without cows, they wouldn’t belch methane, so maybe she’ll be the one who figures out how to do that in a cost-effective way.

But I have yet to find a children’s book that frames the climate crisis that way: as a challenge, but one like the many that humanity has overcome, and one that our kids can overcome by learning about the world and inventing new solutions. If you know of one, I’m in the market for recommendations; if you don’t know, I invite you to think about where this hole in our messages for children leaves them.

Study Finds Climate Change Could Worsen Sleep,"The World Health Organization (WHO) and others have issued stark warnings about the possible effects of continued climate change on human health. According to WHO projections published in 2021, the added costs of climate-related health damage could be $2 to $4 billion by 2030 and between 2030 and 2050, climate changes is estimated to be responsible for 250,000 deaths per year.

Now new research says another possible health cost of increasing global temperatures may be reduced sleep, according to data published on May 20 in the journal One Earth. The researchers estimated that by the year 2099, warmer temperatures could result in people sleeping 50 to 58 hours less per person per year on average (about 8 to 10 minutes per night).

“Less sleep overall places you at increased risk for mood disorders, energy reduction, decreased quality of life, car accidents and other health concerns (like diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers),” says Kendra Becker, MD, a sleep medicine specialist and internist at Kaiser Permanente in Fontana, California. Dr. Becker was not involved in the research.

Lack of sleep has been linked to worse cognitive performance, lower productivity, compromised heart health and immune function, and increased risk of depression and suicidal behavior, the researchers noted in the paper.

Sleeping 8 to 10 minutes less per night may not sound that drastic, but it adds up over time, Becker says. “It’s like debt on a credit card; it becomes harder and hard to pay it back over time.”

For the many adults who are already not sleeping enough, more sleep loss could have significant effects on daytimes sleepiness, fatigue, and mood.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults get seven to nine hours of sleep every night. Estimates suggests that 1 in 3 adults currently don't get enough sleep, according to CDC data published in 2016.

Other research has shown that high temperature can negatively affect sleep quality and previous studies have also found that hot weather conditions prevalent in summer can significantly impact sleep onset, sleep quality, and sleep satisfaction. But this research is unique in predicting how rising global temperatures might impact future sleep quantity and quality, according to the researchers.

""In this study, we provide the first planetary-scale evidence that warmer-than-average temperatures erode human sleep,"" the study's lead author, Kelton Minor, a doctoral candidate at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said in a press release. ""We show that this erosion occurs primarily by delaying when people fall asleep and by advancing when they wake up during hot weather.""

People on Average Fell Asleep Later and Slept Less on Hot Nights

For the study, scientists analyzed anonymized sleep data collected between 2015 and 2017 from accelerometer-based sleep tracking wristbands from more than 47,000 adults living in 68 countries on every continent besides Antarctica. The dataset included seven billion nightly sleep records.

The sleep records included measures of sleep duration and sleep timing (onset, midsleep, and offset). The researchers also collected climatic and meteorological data that measured temperature, wind speed, daily cloud cover, precipitation, and relative humidity.

The data showed that nightly sleep declines by 14 minutes on average when temperatures topped 30 degrees C, or 86 degrees F. The researchers used global climate forecast models from NASA to calculate, given how many more nights in the year 2099 would top that temperature benchmark, how much sleep would be lost by 2099 due to those hot temperatures. The researchers found that on average if current global climate change models are realized, warming would cause people to sleep 50 to 58 fewer hours per year.

On average women, older adults, and people living in low-income countries were most affected by the temperature effect on sleep loss, according to the data collected for nights between 2015 and 2017. Older adults were 2 times more likely to be affected by temperature’s impact on sleep than other age groups; and people living in developing countries were 3 times more affected than those in wealthier nations.

It's important to note that because the researchers relied on sleep tracking from wearable devices, differences in global access and adoption of this type of technology may introduce bias into the results. Sleep-tracking wristband ownership may be associated with unobserved demographic factors, including higher socioeconomic status, physiological resilience, and access to cooling technologies — especially in lower-middle-income countries, the researchers note in the paper. Additionally the data included more people who were middle-aged, male, and from high- and upper-middle-income countries.

The researchers also note that the dataset did not include as many records of sleep from tropical regions with extreme weather conditions — Africa, Central America, South America, and the Middle East — which estimates suggest stand to suffer some of the most severe effects of climate change.

Future Research Should Focus on How to Sleep Better in the Heat

There’s plenty of research to show that temperature affects sleep. A reduction in body temperature is actually part of how our bodies fall asleep, Becker explains.

""Our core body temperature decreases as evening sets in to help us sleep, which occurs on a nightly basis,” she says. “Extreme changes in temperature can either fragment or reduce sleep.”

The ideal room temperature for sleeping is a cool one — about 68 degrees F, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

""These [new] findings are significant because people are already short on sleep,"" Becker adds. This data suggests warmer temperatures will likely exacerbate the problem because people tend to delay going to sleep and sleep less on hotter nights.

""Sleep is essential for human survival, and anything that impacts it will affect human health,"" adds Neomi Shah, MD, professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, where she specializes in pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine. (Dr. Shah was not involved in the study.) These findings estimate that the impacts of climate change may cause people to delay sleep and sleep less overall.

Future research should investigate the biological mechanisms responsible for these temperature-related changes to sleep, as well as interventions knowing that warming is coming, she says.

The researchers’ next steps are to expand on this work by collecting more data from people living in low-income and developing nations.

Why mental health is a priority for action on climate change,"New WHO policy brief highlights actions for countries

Climate change poses serious risks to mental health and well-being, concludes a new WHO policy brief, launched today at the Stockholm+50 conference. The Organization is therefore urging countries to include mental health support in their response to the climate crisis, citing examples where a few pioneering countries have done this effectively.

The findings concur with a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in February this year. The IPPC revealed that rapidly increasing climate change poses a rising threat to mental health and psychosocial well-being; from emotional distress to anxiety, depression, grief, and suicidal behavior.

“The impacts of climate change are increasingly part of our daily lives, and there is very little dedicated mental health support available for people and communities dealing with climate-related hazards and long-term risk,” said Dr Maria Neira, Director of the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health at WHO.

The mental health impacts of climate change are unequally distributed with certain groups disproportionately affected depending on factors such as socioeconomic status, gender and age. However, it is clear that climate change affects many of the social determinants that are already leading to massive mental health burdens globally. A 2021 WHO survey of 95 countries found that only 9 have thus far included mental health and psychosocial support in their national health and climate change plans.

“The impact of climate change is compounding the already extremely challenging situation for mental health and mental health services globally. There are nearly 1 billion people living with mental health conditions, yet in low- and middle-income countries, 3 out of 4 do not have access to needed services,” said Dévora Kestel, Director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO. “By ramping up mental health and psychosocial support within disaster risk reduction and climate action, countries can do more to help protect those most at risk.”

The new WHO policy brief recommends 5 important approaches for governments to address the mental health impacts of climate change:

integrate climate considerations with mental health programmes;

integrate mental health support with climate action;

build upon global commitments;

develop community-based approaches to reduce vulnerabilities; and

close the large funding gap that exists for mental health and psychosocial support.

“WHO’s Member States have made it very clear mental health is a priority for them. We are working closely with countries to protect people’s physical and mental health from climate threats,” said Dr Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, WHO climate lead, and an IPCC lead author.

Some good examples exist of how this can be done such as in the Philippines, which has rebuilt and improved its mental health services after the impact of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 or in India, where a national project has scaled up disaster risk reduction in the country while also preparing cities to respond to climate risks and address mental health and psychosocial needs.

The Stockholm Conference commemorates the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment and recognizes the importance of environmental determinants for both physical and mental health.

Note to editors

WHO defines mental health as “a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to her or his community”.

WHO defines mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) as “any type of local or outside support that aims to protect or promote psychosocial well-being and/or prevent or treat mental disorder”.

Why Texas Cannot Ignore Climate Change,"Climate change is having a huge impact on Texas. The second-largest US state located in the south-central part of the country – is consistently ranked among the top 10 states most affected by extreme weather events, such as drought, extreme heat, and wildfires.

—

1. Heatwaves

As a 2021 climate report pointed out, record-breaking heatwaves that hit Texas repeatedly in recent decades will become a regular occurrence because of climate change, and the future of the state depends almost exclusively on climate mitigation and adaptation.

Within the past century, most of Texas has warmed at an average of almost 1.5F (0.8C), and summers are getting longer and hotter. The most recent and still ongoing heatwave that hit central US and Texas in late April 2022 has led to three-digit temperatures in the state’s southern and mid-western band for several consecutive days and is spreading north through the Great Plains. According to the aforementioned report, the number of triple-digit days in a year will double by 2036 compared to the past 20 years and temperatures will be a full three degrees warmer than they were from 1950 to 1999.

Figure 1: Texas Temperature Increase, 1895-2021

The heatwave also sparked record demand for air conditioning and electricity. Nearly 45% of it is met by renewable sources, with both solar and wind power generations rising considerably. Historically, the state usually experiences high temperatures during the summer months, however, heatwaves have arrived earlier in recent years as a result of the changing climate.

2. Droughts

The intense heatwaves that Texas is experiencing enhance droughts. The Lone Star state is known for its arid climate and while droughts are a natural occurrence here, climate change and rising global temperatures have made them much more severe in recent decades, altering rainfall patterns and drying moisture in the soil at faster rates. For this reason, Texas is classified as the state most at risk of widespread drought, with experts predicting that by 2050 it will see an increase in the severity of such events of nearly 75%.

Overall, experts estimate that in the coming years, average rainfall is likely to decrease – especially during winter, spring, and summer and in 70 years’ time, the longest period without rain each year is likely to be at least three days longer than it is today. This will contribute to increased evaporation and subsequent reduction in water content in rivers and streams as well as insufficient water to irrigate crops or even drinkable water to satisfy the basic needs of Texas’ growing population.

Figure 2: Texas Drought Monitor, May 2022

Water shortage in Texas is also a big issue from an economic point of view. The state is based on three, very thirsty sectors – fossil fuel generation, real estate development, and agriculture – with nearly 60% of Texas’ water resources used for crops. Each sector is heavily impacted every time droughts occur. The food industry is particularly vulnerable: as severe droughts damage crops and limit forage growth needed to raise cattle for beef, the state’s supply chain will be under immense pressure, likely leading to a spike in food prices.

3. Wildfires and Extreme Weather Events

Heatwaves and droughts are not the only issues Texas should be worried about. Hotter temperatures and drier conditions are driving up the risk of wildfires and intensifying weather events such as rainstorms and hurricanes.

Already in the spring of 2022, hundreds of wildfires have broken out amid an intense heatwave, leading to more than 200 counties being classified as ‘crop disaster areas’ – meaning that their crops are expected to either fail or be significantly smaller as a result of wildfires. Between January and May 2022, more than 400,000 acres have burned, seven times as many acres as the same period last year. Fears of water shortages have also prompted the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to issue mandatory water use restrictions, as water levels in some reservoirs have fallen to less than 20% of capacity.

Currently, more than 70% of the state’s population, equivalent to nearly 18 million people, live in areas at elevated risk of wildfire. Texas – which currently has the second-highest wildfire risk in the US after California by 2050, is expected to become the state most threatened by such events as global warming worsens.

While climate change is often associated with rising temperatures, scientists suggest that the impact of global warming on the Arctic can cause southerly cold snaps like the ones that Texas repeatedly experienced in the last few years. The most recent one took place during the first months of 2021, when the state was hit by a blast of cold air coming out of Canada that caused breakdowns in water systems, overburdened the electrical grid, and triggered widespread power outages.

Global warming has also drastically intensified the impact of hurricanes. As temperatures rise, evaporation accelerates, so does the transfer of heat from oceans to the air. The heat and vapour that storms absorb when travelling across warm waters fuel winds and rainfall, causing increasingly severe floods. 2021 was an ‘above average’ and fourth-most costly Atlantic hurricane season on record, with 21 severe storms hitting Texas, seven of which became hurricanes, in addition to four other major hurricanes.

The worst event to hit Texas was Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which resulted in more than 100 fatalities, caused flood water contamination resulting from a chemical facility malfunction, and cost the state a staggering USD$125 billion in damage. New research suggests that the odds for slow-moving storms like Harvey happening more frequently during the Atlantic hurricane season are now higher than ever, as climate change is expected to intensify winds that steer hurricanes north over Texas in the final 25 years of the current century.

4. Sea Level Rise

One last major climate change-related issue that Texas is currently facing is above-average sea level rise. Between 1950 and today, sea levels already rose 18 inches (41 centimetres) and continue to rise at a faster rate of about one inch (2.5 centimetres) per year. This, coupled with coastal erosion, is putting the agglomeration around Texas’ most populous city, Houston, at risk of regular flooding in the coming decades. Slightly higher sea levels can make a big difference in extreme storm surge occurrence. A 1-in-100 year flooding event (an intensity that has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year) could become a 1-in-10 year event by 2050, making communities living near coasts much more vulnerable. Today, Texas has 127,000 people at risk of coastal flooding but by mid-century, an additional 117,000 people are projected to be at risk due to this phenomenon.

Is There A Way Out?

Texas weather is rapidly changing due to climate change, making living in the state harder and recovery from increasingly disruptive events much more expensive. Experts agree that preparation and resilience have to be on top of the agenda. Yet, the only long-term solution to extreme weather events is to tackle the root cause, climate change. Our planet has already warmed around 1.1C since pre-industrial times, and we are still on track to exceed 1.5C of warming within the next two decades. Unless the world at large drastically stops adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, record-high heatwaves and other extreme weather conditions will become even more frequent, threatening millions more lives around the world. The race is now on to drastically cut emissions and help people adapt to warming that is already locked in.",,[],[]
New data reveals climate change might be more rapid than predicted,"Winter storms in the Southern Hemisphere. Credit: NASA Worldview

About 30 massive, intricate computer networks serve the scientists who stand at the forefront of climate change research. Each network runs a software program comprised of millions of lines of code. These programs are computational models that combine the myriads of physical, chemical and biological phenomena that together form the climate of our planet. The models calculate the state of Earth's atmosphere, oceans, land and ice, capturing past and present climate variability and using the data to predict future climate change. These results are analyzed by leading research institutes across the globe, including the Weizmann Institute of Science, and then incorporated into the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report. Policymakers rely on the IPCC report when they form adaptation and mitigation strategies for climate change, one of our generation's greatest crises.

A new study, published today in Nature Climate Change, will certainly make the IPCC—and other environmental bodies—take notice. A team of scientists led by Dr. Rei Chemke of Weizmann's Earth and Planetary Sciences Department revealed a considerable intensification of winter storms in the Southern Hemisphere. The study, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Yi Ming of Princeton University and Dr. Janni Yuval of MIT, is sure to make waves in the climate conversation. Until now, climate models have projected a human-caused intensification of winter storms only toward the end of this century. In the new study, Chemke and his team compared climate model simulations with current storm observations. Their discovery was bleak: It became clear that storm intensification over recent decades has already reached levels projected to occur in the year 2080.

""A winter storm is a weather phenomenon that lasts only a few days. Individually, each storm doesn't carry much climatic weight. However, the long-term effect of winter storms becomes evident when assessing cumulative data collected over long periods of time,"" Chemke explains. Cumulatively, these storms have a significant impact, affecting the transfer of heat, moisture and momentum within the atmosphere, which consequently affects the various climate zones on Earth. ""One example of this is the role the storms play in regulating the temperature at the Earth's poles. Winter storms are responsible for the majority of the heat transport away from tropical regions toward the poles. Without their contribution, the average pole temperatures would be about 30°C lower."" Similarly, the collective intensification of these storms yields a real and significant threat to societies in the Southern Hemisphere in the next decades.

""We chose to focus on the Southern Hemisphere because the intensification registered there has been stronger than in the Northern Hemisphere,"" Chemke says. ""We didn't examine the Northern Hemisphere, but it seems that the intensification of storms in this hemisphere is slower compared to that in the Southern Hemisphere. If the trend persists,"" Chemke adds, ""we will be observing more significant winter storm intensification here in the upcoming years and decades.""

In his lab at the Weizmann Institute, Chemke researches the physical mechanisms underlying large-scale climate change. In this study, he and his research partners sought to understand whether these changes in climate patterns were caused by external factors (such as human activity), or whether they have resulted from the internal fluctuations of the global climate system. They analyzed climate models that simulated storm intensification patterns under the isolated influence of internal climatic causes, without external impact. They showed that over the past 20 years, storms have been intensifying faster than can be explained by internal climatic behavior alone.

In addition, the researchers discovered the physical process behind the storm intensification. An analysis of the growth rate of the storms showed that changes in atmospheric jet streams over the past few decades have caused these escalations, and current climate models are unable to reflect these changes accurately.

Chemke, Ming and Yuval's study has two immediate, considerable implications. First, it shows that not only climate projections for the coming decades are graver than previous assessments, but it also suggests that human activity might have a greater impact on the Southern Hemisphere than previously estimated. This means that rapid and decisive intervention is required in order to halt the climate damage in this region. Second, a correction of the bias in climate models is in order, so that these can provide a more accurate climate projection in the future.

Could the climate models be inaccurately predicting other important phenomena? ""The models are doing a very good job at forecasting nearly all the parameters,"" Chemke says. ""We've discovered one parameter for which the sensitivity of the models needs to be adjusted. Changes in temperature, precipitation, sea ice, and summer storm patterns, for example, are all being simulated accurately.""

The study's findings are expected to help climate researchers around the world correct the bias in the models and create a more accurate prediction of future climate patterns. In addition, the updated understanding of the intensification of winter storms over the past several decades will help us gain a better understanding of the state of the Earth's climate. Climate scientists will now be able to estimate more accurately the extent of the damage that climate change is expected to wreak—damage that will only be mitigated if humanity intervenes and takes responsibility for the future of the planet.

Warmer Nights Caused by Climate Change Take a Toll on Sleep,"Trouble sleeping?

Climate change may be to blame and, according to researchers, it’s only going to get worse.

A study released last week by a team of climatologists found that by the end of this century, sleeplessness related to global warming will be so pervasive that our descendants will likely lose roughly two and a half days of sleep per year compared to the levels that typical adults enjoy today.

The findings, published in a peer-reviewed study in the journal One Earth, used data from more than 10 billion sleep-duration measurements from tracking wristbands across 68 different countries and combined that with local weather and climate data.

“We found that warmer than average nights harmed human sleep globally and unequally so people sleep less and the probability of having a short night of sleep steeply increases as the temperatures warm outside,” said Kelton Minor, a doctoral student at the University of Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science and the lead author of the study.

“And I think importantly, we found that this hidden human cost of heat is not distributed equally in the population,” Minor said, noting that he and his colleagues found that sleep loss per degree of warming occurs approximately twice as much among the elderly as compared to younger or middle aged adults. That rate was approximately three times higher for lower income versus high income countries.

Minor said that nighttime temperatures are warming faster than daytime temperatures for two reasons: anthropogenic – or human-induced – climate change and urbanization.

“On top of the global warming that we are experiencing, which is warming in most land-based regions faster at night than during the day, we also have more people moving into urban environments where the urban fabric itself—the asphalt, the lack of greenery—releases heat at night when people are sleeping,” he said. “So it creates this urban heat island effect, which amplifies nighttime temperatures.”

Donald Edmondson, a social psychologist and the director of the Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said the study was one of the first to measure the effects of climate change on sleep patterns.

That is significant, Edmondson said, because of what research has found about the links between length of sleep and the risk of adverse health events.

He said that one analysis has shown that when people sleep for fewer than 6 hours, they are as much as 50 percent more likely to have a cardiovascular event.

“In the long term, as short sleep nights accumulate, the risk continues to increase,” Edmondson said.

Minor said that researchers were unable to determine why those lower-income countries were at greater risk for sleep loss.

“We don’t know exactly why,” Minor said. “It could be access to air conditioning, it may be access to other technologies. Unfortunately, we did not randomize or measure those outcomes. But what we do know is that there is a large disparity in the size of the effect by country income level. And, you know, that’s sort of ground for future research as well to try to understand what is driving that vulnerability.”

Christian Braneon, a climate scientist who is co-director at Columbia University’s Environmental Justice and Climate Just Cities Network, urged urban planners, public policy experts and others to keep the most vulnerable in mind as they work to mitigate the effects of climate change.

“In the context of low income countries, what you see previously in the literature is people say, ‘These folks are maybe in areas of high crime, so they can’t just leave their window open.’ And so that’s a concern,” Braneon said.

“We often don’t talk about climate change impacts on quality of life,” he said. “Folks won’t necessarily die during every extreme weather event or every heat wave, but their quality of life is being compromised. And this could exacerbate chronic illnesses, and ultimately lead to shorter life lifespans and and other other challenges for people.”

Minor and his team found that by 2099, people could lose anywhere from 50 to 58 hours of sleep annually—the equivalent of two and a half days when combined or 11 nights of short sleep per person per year.

“And that number is going to increase,” Minor said. “But how much it increases will depend on the actions we take today to lower the future burden of nighttime temperature on human slumber. And we don’t know at this point in time which trajectory we will take within the Earth’s climate system.

“We are in control of our destiny,” he said. “We have to act as a society if we want to make a dent.”",,[],"['Aydali Campa', 'Agya K. Aning', 'Victoria St. Martin', 'Grace Van Deelen', 'Dan Gearino', 'Aman Azhar']"

Reisinger’s research and teaching focus primarily on two seemingly unconnected fields of study: French for professional purposes, and refugee studies. The connection between the two? Reisinger, who holds an affiliate appointment at the Duke Global Health Institute, uses her dual expertise to explore how climate change is driving global migration by displacing millions of people worldwide, and how the language used by governments to define who a refugee is and what he or she must be fleeing from can limit the aid they receive and undermine their resettlement.

“I have been struck by the rigid definitions that continue to define refugee status, notably that climate change displacement does not ‘count,’” she said. “What are the consequences of such population shifts for persons who cannot claim refugee status, not only politically and economically, but culturally? What is the human toll of these massive migrations?”

Sexton’s research focuses on energy industry organization and energy policy, as well as environmental and transportation policy, particularly as they pertain to carbon emissions reductions.

Using econometric methods and insights from behavioral economics, he has evaluated air pollution control policies; policies for rooftop solar technology adoption; the environmental impacts of local foods and genetically engineered crops; household electricity consumption; and renewable technology adoption, among other topics.

“Much of the discourse on climate change supposes we are doomed unless we quickly halt the combustion of fossil fuels. Such conclusions invoke climate science but skip over evidence from climate change economics, which endeavors to establish a value for the risks climate change poses and identify cost-effective measures to reduce them,” he said. “This approach presents a less pessimistic view of our future, in part because it admits that humans are a highly adaptable species. I am eager to teach students about the importance of valuing the likely impacts of climate change so they can assess the tradeoffs of alternative climate policies.”

The pandemic showed us how interconnected we are. Will our climate response reflect that?,"The pandemic showed us how interconnected we are. Will our climate response reflect that?

More than 2,000 years ago, somewhere near the Mediterranean Sea, a mathematician named Eratosthenes used a shadow cast at noon on the equinox to calculate the circumference of the Earth. The answer he got was 28,735 miles.

In modern times, with the aid of GPS units and satellites, scientists know the true answer to be 24,850 miles. Basic math hasn't changed much since Eratosthenes' day, and his conclusion was impressively close. But since then, communication technology, global travel and especially the COVID-19 pandemic have made the distance around the planet feel much smaller.

Air travel can now transport a human around the world, through the atmosphere shared by Earth's 7.9 billion other humans, in just a few days. In 2020, it became obvious that viruses can make that trip too.

The lesson to be learned from this, according to scientist authors of recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other publications, is that pandemics, like climate change, are a shared, global problem. They argue that solutions must be pursued with a global focus as well. And they're outlining ways we can tackle both issues at the same time.

Around the world in 91 days

It took 91 days from when symptoms of the illness now known as COVID-19 were first documented among a group of patients in Wuhan, China, on December 12, 2019, until the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.

It has been much longer since scientists started issuing warnings about how climate change accelerates the risk of widespread disease outbreaks.

In 2016, a team of scientists published a review paper in the peer-reviewed journal Environment International, synthesizing knowledge on, as they titled the summary, the ""Impact of climate change on human infectious diseases."" To bring the picture of the intersection between climate and disease risk into focus, they pulled together insights from 131 research articles dating back to 1990, some of which detailed transmission events linked to climatic abnormalities occurring as early as the mid-1500s.

""Studies have found that long-term climate warming tends to favor the geographic expansion of several infectious diseases, and that extreme weather events may help create the opportunities for more clustered disease outbreaks or outbreaks at non-traditional places and time,"" the paper reads.

The climate connection: Why scientists say slowing climate change could help prevent another pandemic

In other words, signals of climate change like warming temperatures and increased flooding create the conditions disease vectors like mosquitoes and ticks require to spread into areas where they were not previously common. Wildlife or livestock in these regions, many already stressed by the same habitat changes, can then become intermediate hosts for new pathogens these vectors introduce.

Add in a skyrocketing human population, increasing international travel and activities like deforestation, bushmeat hunting and the wildlife trade — which lead to novel interactions between animals and people — and you have a perfect recipe for worldwide viral invasion.

""Pandemics don't respect geographic boundaries,"" said Timothy Lant, a mathematician and director of program development for Arizona State University’s Knowledge Enterprise. ""We know that global climate change and globalization have caused an increase in risk of the emergence of new diseases that can quickly become global pandemics. The ecologists and the public health people, they've all known about this for decades.""

Climate and cities: Population growth brings greater climate risks to metro areas, report says, but also hope

Lant has more than 20 years of experience using math, computers and policy knowledge to conduct risk assessments for pandemics ""and other frightening things"" in government, academic, think-tank, corporate and nonprofit settings. In 2014, he led the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service Ebola Modeling Coordination Group. At ASU, he helps science and engineering teams manage diverse research projects.

When he steps back and looks at the big picture, he sees clearly the influence of global climate change in many of the public health threats the world is experiencing today.

“In a very real way, I have started to think of climate change as actually being the risk itself instead of having pandemic risk. They’re so close that pandemics are just another risk factor of climate change,"" Lant said.

Climate and forests: Forests often regenerate after wildfires. Why the climate crisis could change that

In the May 2021 issue of the scientific journal Nature Medicine, others with this viewpoint also drew a strong parallel between the necessary response to climate and pandemic threats by calling for an Intergovernmental Panel on Pandemic Risk that would be ""akin to the role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.""

Following the model of the IPCC, the authors view an international research body dedicated to pandemics as the best way for the world to keep up with the evolving science of pandemics, inform responsive policy and address socio-economic risks, shield conclusions from various local political pressures and keep the topic on the world's agenda rather than casting it as ""a problem for another generation.""

Climate and fire: 'We don't have a season anymore': How climate change has affected wildfire preparedness

A year later, in May 2022, two more scientific articles called for global coordination in simultaneous pandemic and climate mitigation. A comment in the journal Nature demanded more attention to pandemic and climate change prevention, rather than just response, pushing for nongovernmental action to address dual risk factors like deforestation and poverty. And a review paper published in the medical journal The Lancet pointed to actions like curbing urban meat demand and addressing biodiversity decline as ways the human community could keep climate impacts and pandemic risk in check if those actions can span international borders.

""Entire economies are based on (deforestation for) agriculture or hunting bushmeat,"" Lant said. ""You can talk about all these problems in Southeast Asia and these problems in Central Africa and in Amazon systems. We look at these issues as though (they're) on the other side of the world, in a remote, underprivileged village where a primitive society is engaged with risky activities. But if we make investments in helping them to advance in sustainable ways, that reduces the risk of emerging infectious diseases and we can also address climate change.""

It's equally important to research local risk factors and work on improving understanding about how things like Arizona's changing climate and ""the relationship of health and water quality and heat"" influence movements of local disease vectors like bird populations, Lant said. It's about thinking globally and locally at the same time.

In February, the IPCC's Working Group II agreed that, in a pandemic and climate-ravaged world, action must be locally specific while being globally coordinated.

""The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the value of coordinated planning across sectors, safety nets, and other capacities in societies to cope with a range of shocks and stresses and to alleviate systems-wide risks to health,"" read the technical summary report authored by 270 top climate scientists from 67 countries.

Math as a way to coordinate local and global action

At ASU, an interdisciplinary group of researchers are trying to think globally while working locally to leverage their diverse areas of expertise for improved pandemic preparedness.

In April 2020, the team received nearly $200,000 from the National Science Foundation's Rapid Response Research fund to use data and computer models to explore how COVID-19 spread through locations over time and what that had to do with local policy measures.

""It's a pretty cool collaboration between people in the arts and media, policy, geography, computer science and math,"" said Gautam Dasarathy, an assistant professor in ASU's School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering who is leading the effort. ""We were brainstorming about how we could use data science and our policy insights to understand something about the pandemic.""

Viruses in Hiding: You caught a virus and recovered. But what happens when that virus stays inside you forever?

That project is still underway and climate change wasn't explicitly part of the initial proposal. But it's something they are thinking about more and more seriously as a necessary component of the pandemic equation.

""There are several exacerbations that climate change brings to this problem,"" Dasarathy said. ""One of them is it drastically changes the interspecies transmission landscape. There are more species that are moving beyond the traditional habitats to come into contact with other species. And this could seriously change the statistics of when such infections happens.""

In a previous project that published in June 2021, Dasarathy worked with ASU collaborator Patricia Solis, an associate professor of geography in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, to consider how uneven outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States are explained by state-level policy decisions. It underscored for them the importance of paying attention to geography and local circumstances when trying to develop best practices for pandemic response.

""In a place like Arizona, where it gets so hot, (shutdowns) definitely resulted in a disparate impact for people who are less fortunate, because people living without as much air conditioning, they couldn't just go pop into a mall for a few hours in a day,"" Dasarathy said of that paper's findings. ""We're not equipped to deal with suddenly the entire population staying at home.""

Pandemics and climate: Scientists want to stop the next pandemic before it starts. Here are the tests they're building to do it

As of May 31 2022, the World Health Organization had recorded more than 6.2 million deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At least some of those deaths were exacerbated by local climate impacts, like heat exposure in Arizona. The data is messy and complex, but is tracked daily and displayed neatly thanks to supercomputers that likely exceed the wildest dreams of ancient mathematicians like Eratosthenes, who managed to calculate the earth's circumference using just a shadow and geometry in 200 B.C.

The challenge now, according to climate and disease scientists around the entire 24,850-mile expanse of the globe, is to take advantage of modern technological advances to find the new right answer.

Bill Gates explains what you can do now to fight climate change,"Chesnot | Getty Images News | Getty Images

Climate change is such an overwhelming and systemic problem, it's easy to feel there's nothing one individual can do to fight it. But Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates gave some concrete suggestions in an online question and answer session on Reddit on Thursday.

Buy climate-friendly products to help drive costs down

As a consumer, if you opt to buy more expensive products that contribute less carbon emissions, it may feel like a drop in the bucket. But if enough people buy those products, it will drive demand, leading to larger scale and pushing down the price of those climate conscious options, he said. ""As green products come out like electric cars or synthetic meat or heat pumps for home heating/cooling they will cost a bit extra. By buying these products you drive scaling up which will lead to lower prices so 'green premiums' are reduced,"" Gates said on Reddit. The idea of a ""green premium"" is one that Gates has discussed often. It's the difference in price between a conventional product and the climate-friendly alternative. Governments can help reduce the green premium by implementing policies that reduce the price of the climate conscious option and make the conventional variety more expensive, Gates said in a 2020 blog post about green premiums. Companies and investors can also help reduce the green premium by spending on climate friendly alternatives, investing in innovation and advocating governments. But so too can individuals make a difference in the development of markets for new, cleaner product options. ""When you buy an electric vehicle or a plant-based burger even though it costs more than the alternative, you're saying to the companies that make these products: 'There's demand for these items. Make more and we'll buy them,'"" Gates wrote in a blog post on the topic published in 2020. ""That will drive investment in research, which helps decrease the price and ultimately makes clean products more affordable and available for everyone.""

Of course, for some, the more expensive alternative is not financially possible, and Gates acknowledges this in his blog post.

Vote, and start local

In addition to supporting new green industries, individuals can help combat climate change by influencing the companies where they work and voting for elected officials who will prioritize climate policies, Gates said. In his Reddit answer, Gates linked to a 2021 blog post which excerpted a chapter from his book, ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,"" where he emphasized importance of voting, which, unlike buying green products, does not require spending money. ""Engaging in the political process is the most important single step that people from every walk of life can take to help avoid a climate disaster,"" Gates wrote in his book. Politicians are constantly juggling a myriad of priorities and if their constituents voice their concerns about climate issues, then politicians are more likely to focus their energy there, Gates wrote. ""Whatever other resources you may have, you can always use your voice and your vote to effect change,"" Gates wrote in his book. ""Make calls, write letters, attend town halls. What you can help your leaders understand is that it's just as important for them to think about the long-term problem of climate change as it is for them to think about jobs or education or health care."" Also, when using your voice politically, be specific and start local, Gates says. ""In the United States, for example, electricity is primarily regulated by statewide public utility commissions, made up of either elected or appointed commissioners. Know who your representatives are and keep in touch with them,"" Gates writes in his book. And if you're up for it, run for political office, Gates writes.

Climate change could expand forests. But will they cool the planet?,"Table of contents A version of this story appeared in Science, Vol 376, Issue 6595. Download PDF

These are strange times for the Indigenous Nenets reindeer herders of northern Siberia. In their lands on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, bare tundra is thawing, bushes are sprouting, and willows that a generation ago struggled to reach knee height now grow 3 meters tall, hiding the reindeer. Surveys show the Nenets autonomous district, an area the size of Florida, now has four times as many trees as official inventories recorded in the 1980s.

In some places the trees are advancing along a wide front, but in other places the gains are patchier, says forest ecologist Dmitry Schepaschenko of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, who has mapped the greening of the Siberian tundra. “A few trees appear here and there, and some shrublike trees become higher.”

All around the Arctic Circle, trees are invading as the climate warms. In Norway, birch and pine are marching poleward, eclipsing the tundra. In Alaska, spruce are taking over from moss and lichen. Globally, recent research indicates forests are expanding along two-thirds of Earth’s 12,000-kilometer-long northern tree line—the point where forests give way to tundra—while receding along just 1% (see map, below).

Forest gains are not confined to the far north. At lower latitudes, some warmer, arid regions are also seeing an uptick in trees, in part because increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2 )—the main planet-warming gas—are enabling plants to use water more efficiently and thrive in drier soils. And the fertilizing effects of CO 2 are enabling existing forests to add more leaves and wood, increasing their biomass.

It’s a startlingly different picture from what is unfolding in the tropics, where hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest are lost each year to chainsaws and fire, and climate change is stressing the remaining trees. But those tropical losses could be more than offset by gains elsewhere, some studies predict, leading in the coming decades to a world with more and faster growing trees.

That might seem like surprisingly good news for curbing global warming. Forests often have a cooling effect, releasing organic compounds and water vapor that promote the formation of clouds. And more, faster growing trees would absorb more atmospheric carbon and lock it away in wood.

But the calculus of forests’ climate effects is far from straightforward, and emerging research suggests a more forested world won’t necessarily be a cooler world. New forests could enhance warming in some areas, for example, by reducing the amount of sunlight that is reflected into space. Over time, that could offset any gains in carbon absorption.

“Forests are not just carbon sponges,” says environmental scientist Deborah Lawrence of the University of Virginia. But that complexity, she adds, “is not adequately captured by current carbon-centric metrics.”

To account for how forests will affect future climate, researchers must not only tally current trends, such as development-driven deforestation, but also forecast how powerful forces such as surges in wildfire and warmer temperatures might affect forests, sometimes helping and sometimes harming their ability to soak up atmospheric carbon.

Historically, researchers have focused much of their attention on the losses side of the balance sheet, for example by quantifying the steady erosion of tropical forests, one of the planet’s major carbon sinks. In the Amazon, the world’s most expansive tropical forest, the news has been almost unremittingly bad. Overall, it has shrunk by about 18% since the 1970s because of deforestation.

V. Altounian/ Science

In 2007, meteorologist Carlos Nobre of Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) warned the ongoing losses could flip the Amazon from acting as a global carbon sink to a significant new source. Simulations of the Amazon’s hydrological cycle, he found, showed deforestation would make rainforests drier, reduce tree growth, and promote tree losses, resulting in a net release of carbon to the atmosphere.

That prediction now appears to have been realized, says INPE climate researcher Luciana Gatti. Drawing on measurements of atmospheric carbon collected during 590 research flights over the Amazon between 2010 and 2018, she reported in a July 2021 Nature study that the southeastern Amazon—a region often called the “arc of deforestation,” where agriculture has gobbled vast swaths of trees—had flipped from sink to source. So, in consequence, had the Amazon as a whole. “We have hit a tipping point,” she says.

The years since 2018 have been “even worse” for the Amazon’s carbon storage capacity, Gatti says, as warming temperatures have compounded the effects of deforestation. Longer dry seasons are stressing trees and increasing fire risks, accelerating the conversion of forest to more open savannas. Overall, the Amazon’s total carbon storage could drop by one-third in coming decades if regional temperatures rise by 4°C, modeling studies conducted by climate scientist Chris Jones and colleagues at the United Kingdom’s Met Office conclude.

In the meantime, however, some tropical forests are continuing to sequester large amounts of carbon. For example, one longterm field study in the lowland forests on the island of Borneo recently reported that intact 1-hectare plots, where tree deaths remain infrequent, hold an average of 20 tons more carbon today than they did in 1958, primarily because of CO 2 fertilization.

But ongoing warming is working against tropical forests, even those that are still intact. An international study that has tracked 300,000 trees in more than 500 plots of intact tropical forests over 30 years finds that even without deforestation, their ability to capture CO 2 peaked in the 1990s and has since declined by one-third. The decline began in the Amazon, and since 2010 has extended to tropical Africa, says co-author Simon Lewis, a plant ecologist at University College London. Remote-sensing techniques that assess changes in the total leaf area produced by trees and other plants also suggest many tropical forests are slowing their carbon intake.

This bleak picture brightens outside the tropics. In cooler regions, research suggests climate trends are driving gains in both forest extent and productivity that could more than compensate for losses in the tropics— “presuming,” Lawrence says, “that the world can meet its goals for limiting deforestation.” (So far, it’s not clear it will.)

Franklin/ Science ; (Data) Logan Berner and Scott Goetz/Northern Arizona University; NASA’s Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment

One source of optimism are studies showing higher CO 2 levels are already helping forests add biomass. For example, a widely cited 2016 study headed by remote sensing researcher Zhu Zaichun of Peking University found that between one-quarter and one-half of the planet’s vegetated places showed an increase in leaf area since 1982, whereas just 4% showed a decline. Simulations by Zhu’s team suggest CO 2 fertilization accounts for 70% of the increase in global forest biomass.

In the future, more CO 2 will also prompt forests to expand into new areas, other planet-scale simulations indicate. These digital models allow researchers to explore how forests might respond to a wide array of factors, including changes in global temperatures and atmospheric carbon concentrations. One such study, published in December 2021 in JGR Atmospheres by climatologist Jennifer Kowalczyk of Brown University, found warming alone caused vegetation to decrease globally, with tropical losses from overheating exceeding nontropical gains from longer growing seasons. But that finding flipped when she added the fertilizing effects of increased atmospheric CO 2 . Overall, boosting CO 2 levels to about 560 parts per million—or double preindustrial levels— increased global forest cover by 15% above preindustrial extent.

Much of the simulated increase occurred in boreal forests of the north, where longer growing seasons and thawing permafrost help trees gain ground. But forests also expanded in arid continental interiors in the subtropics.

That was somewhat surprising, Kowalczyk says, because the greening in arid zones “occurs even without significant increases in precipitation.” Instead, she says, the extra atmospheric CO 2 allows trees to reduce water loss, because they don’t need to open their stomata so wide to take in CO 2 . That enables seedlings to take root where none grow today.

Some researchers question optimistic predictions of future forest expansion. One issue, they say, is that other factors could intervene. Deforestation, for example, could accelerate to satisfy growing global demand for food and resources, wiping out any global gains. And a shortage of key soil nutrients such as phosphorus could neutralize CO 2 fertilization, especially in tropical forests, says Chris Huntingford of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology. In the Amazon, for example, a 2019 study published in Nature Geoscience, led by ecosystem modeler Katrin Fleischer of the Technical University of Munich, found that a lack of adequate phosphorus could cut forest gains from CO 2 fertilization in half.

Another big question is how a warmer, drier climate will influence wildfires. Modeling studies have long warned that climate change will increase fire risks in tropical and temperate forests. Boreal forests could also see losses. In an early portent, Global Forest Watch reported earlier this year that boreal forests lost more than 8 million hectares in 2021, 30% more than in 2020, with wildfires mostly to blame.

But fire could also enable some boreal forests to store more carbon, not less, plant ecologists say. That’s because regenerating forests can produce stands that are denser or comprise more vigorous species better adapted to fire.

Michelle Mack, a forest ecologist at Northern Arizona University, has seen this arboreal phoenix in action. After fires devastated evergreen spruce forests in Alaska in 2004, their charred remains were replaced by faster growing and less flammable aspen and birch—deciduous trees that could ultimately store up to five times more carbon than their evergreen predecessors. “I thought there was no way these forests could recover the carbon they lost in the fire,” Mack says. “But these deciduous trees did so rapidly.”

This phenomenon appears to be widespread across western North America and in the Russian Far East, she says. Schepaschenko concurs. In Siberia, he says, fires have helped fuel the northward spread of forests into the tundra. “The flames remove moss and lichen cover, allowing [tree] seeds to reach mineral soil.”

Even if models suggesting a more forested future are right, however, it’s not yet clear just how beneficial those trees might be for curbing global warming.

On the plus side, there’s little doubt that forests can help cool the lower atmosphere. One way they do this is by moving large amounts of moisture from soils into the air. A typical tree may “sweat” up to 100 liters of water every day, and the planet’s estimated 3 trillion trees release some 60,000 cubic kilometers each year, the equivalent of flooding the entire U.S. land area with about 6 meters of water.

This transpiration cools the air, as energy is required to convert the liquid water to vapor. And the released vapor, together with other organic compounds produced by trees, helps create clouds that can bring down temperatures. (CO 2 fertilization could reduce transpiration by allowing trees to use water more efficiently, but researchers say it will remain a potent cooling force.)

The relative roughness of a forest canopy also helps reduce temperatures. The leaves and branches cause air currents to swirl and mix, helping dissipate heat higher into the atmosphere.

Together, these two processes currently help cool Earth’s surface by 0.4°C to 0.6°C, Lawrence says, with each contributing about half of the reduction.

But it turns out forests can warm the planet, too, primarily by changing the reflectivity, or albedo, of land surfaces. Gleaming surfaces such as fresh snow have an albedo of 0.8 to 0.9 (on a scale from zero to one), meaning they bounce a lot of solar energy back into space. In contrast, a continuous canopy of broadleaf trees can have an albedo of just 0.15, meaning the trees absorb solar energy and radiate it in the form of heat. A canopy of conifers can have an even lower albedo: 0.08.

In boreal and high-altitude regions that get a lot of snow, the expansion of forests is expected to have a major impact on albedo, as dark canopies replace snow-covered surfaces. In arid regions, the shift can also be dramatic, as trees shade highly reflective sandy or rocky soils. But whether the warming caused by albedo changes will ultimately outstrip a forest’s cooling contribution is likely to depend on several factors, including latitude, altitude, how fast the trees grow, and the age of the forest.

Overall, new forests are likely to have their greatest warming impact at high latitudes and high altitudes, where snow cover is extensive and long-lasting and cold temperatures mean trees grow more slowly, reducing their ability to capture carbon. In the contiguous United States, for example, a study by geographer Chris Williams of Clark University found that over a 100-year span, forests growing in the Rocky Mountains will cause net warming, whereas those growing in lower, less snowy areas east of the Mississippi River and on the Pacific Coast will cause net cooling.

But the impact depends, in part, on when during the forest’s life cycle it is measured. A young forest, for example, might warm the atmosphere because of its albedo effect. But it could become net cooler as the trees age and store more carbon.

In Israel, earth system scientist Dan Yakir of the Weizmann Institute of Science has been watching this balancing act play out in the Yatir Forest, a 2-hour drive from Tel Aviv. Workers created the forest in the 1960s, planting some 4 million Aleppo pines in the yellow sands of the Negev Desert on the slopes of Mount Hebron. Today, the forest is often promoted as a valuable carbon sink.

So far, however, any climate gains are not clear-cut, Yakir says. His measurements of biomass and albedo have shown that, so far, the warming caused by the dark canopy of the pines now exceeds the cooling from their carbon capture. As the trees grow, however, he expects the cooling influence to catch up. But the crossover might not occur until the 2040s, he says—and that assumes the trees live that long.

The findings were unexpected, Yakir says. And he cautions that the Yatir forest is, in some ways, unusual. For example, “The forest is almost black and the desert almost white. … Everything makes our case extreme.”

The uncertainty surrounding how new forests will affect climate poses not just a scientific challenge: It has policy implications, too. Few large-scale tree planting projects, for example, assess the potential climate downsides from a changing albedo. As a result, such greening initiatives “could really backfire” if they “end up placing trees in locations that are counterproductive for cooling the climate,” Williams says.

Then there is the question of how governments should account for new forests when they tally up their contributions to complying with global climate agreements such as the Paris accord. Typically, nations are given credit for protecting or expanding their forests. Russia, for example, calculates that roughly one-quarter of its fossil fuel emissions are offset by its huge, carbon-absorbing forests. And Schepaschenko’s discovery that Russia’s boreal forests are expanding and storing even more carbon suggests the nation could go much further. “We have the potential to turn [new forests] into a massive carbon capture hub,” the nation’s minister of development of the Far East and Arctic, Aleksey Chekunkov, told Bloomberg last year.

But what if new forests turn out to accelerate warming over the long term, not slow it? Should nations still get credit?

Such questions, scientists say, highlight the importance of gaining an even more sophisticated understanding of how forests and Earth’s climate interact. Without a clearer picture, Williams says, “I really worry that we could be placing too much emphasis on forests as a climate solution, when what we really need is deep decarbonization of society.”",,[],['Fred Pearce']
"Climate Change Could Completely Consume the Siberian Tundra by 2050, Studies Show","The paper, which was published in eLife, notes that even with drastic climate measures, marginally more than 30 percent of the Siberian tundra will be able to survive. The permafrost, which is generally below freezing, is expected to almost melt entirely.

The LAVESI model looked at how seeds will be distributed, and how many will mature into adult trees. With climate change, the tundra should reduce to about 6 percent of what it is now.",,[],['Lizzy Rosenberg']
"For 50 years, governments have failed to act on climate change. No more excuses","At the end of February this year, the world’s governments signed on to a statement that was startling in its strength and clarity. “The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and planetary health,” reads the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. “Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.’”

You might think that political leaders could have no higher priority than securing a “liveable and sustainable future”. Is that not what all of us, in every country, need and want for ourselves and for future generations? It is true that other issues are causing grave concern in many societies: governments worldwide are tackling poverty and hunger, wars and civil conflicts, the rising cost of food and energy, health systems and economies crippled by Covid-19.

But as three former UN climate chiefs, let us be clear: as the world’s first major environment summit - the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment - recognised, the crises in security, health, development and the environment are linked. They are loading stress upon stress, especially in the most fragile and conflict-torn parts of the world. The myriad reports of extreme weather we have witnessed in 2022 suggest there is no time to waste.

The further climate change progresses, the more we lock in a future featuring more ruined harvests and more food insecurity along with a host of other problems including rises in sea level, threats to water security, drought and desertification. Governments must act against climate change while also dealing with other pressing crises. We recall the Barbados prime minister, Mia Mottley’s words at Cop26: “The leaders of today – not 2030, not 2050 – must make this choice.”

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted 30 years ago. In our time leading its secretariat, we have witnessed commitments and pledges that have not been fully honoured. While developed countries accepted the convention’s principle of equity and thus their responsibility to lead climate action, their performance has been disappointing, not least in reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases and in mobilising financial support for developing countries that need it.

In the 2015 Paris agreement, all governments agreed to “pursue efforts” to limit global warming to 1.5C (2.7F). We are entitled now to ask where their efforts have reached, where they are heading and how genuine they are. Science shows action this decade to reduce all greenhouse gases is critical. But the sum total of policies in place now will take us to a world hotter by 2.7C and perhaps a catastrophic 3.6C above pre-industrial levels.

If science has not persuaded most governments to act, perhaps economics will. The IPCC provides clear evidence that societies will be more prosperous in a world where climate change is constrained, than in one left to burn. In the energy sector, evidence of the zero-carbon transition is all around us. Wind and solar generation shows compound growth of about 20% a year and is cheaper almost everywhere than the alternatives. Electric car sales doubled between 2020 and 2021.

Unless one is invested in fossil fuels, there is now no reason not to take the clean energy path. Many corporate actors understand the need for early action on this front. But governments still need to incentivise the transition. The evolving Just Energy Transition packages may yet offer an investment pathway that can accelerate deployment in emerging and developing countries. Corporate action towards other targets such as reduction of methane emissions, also needs to be encouraged.

If economics should give us hope for accelerating action despite the host of other issues menacing our times, then so should history. Fifty years ago the international community faced a similar litany of troubles: depletion of natural resources, desertification, the legacy of atom bomb testing, mercury contamination, cold war proxy conflicts. Geopolitics split the world. Yet at the 1972 Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, leaders agreed to cooperate on threats faced in common.

Now, with geopolitics made frosty by superpower disagreements and with nations bleeding from Covid and conflict, the world’s people need their leaders once more to work together. Governments have acknowledged that their window of opportunity to avert dangerous climate change is closing and have admitted the perils that failure will bring. Rapidly changing economics mean that a climate-safe future is also a more prosperous one. The will of the public – especially among young people – to see climate change constrained is clear.

As we recall the Stockholm conference on its 50th anniversary this week, we need national leaders to recall what it demonstrated about the potential of cooperative action even in disturbed times. We need to see leaders delivering on their climate change promises, in the interests of people, prosperity and the planet.
