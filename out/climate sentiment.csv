Climate change is increasingly viewed as a public health crisis,"Placeholder while article actions load

Happy Tuesday, everyone. Yes, there’s a band called the Affordable Rock ‘n’ Roll Act. And yes, a prominent geneticist and White House acting science adviser is a member (h/t Stat) Today’s edition: The House will vote today on legislation to protect the families of Supreme Court justices. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra has covid again, the second time in roughly a month. Many baby formula plants were inspected amid the pandemic. But first …

The warming planet is a public health issue

For the first time, the American Medical Association adopted a policy declaring climate change a public health crisis.

The nation’s largest physician trade group voted yesterday to put its lobbying heft behind policies aimed at limiting global warming and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The AMA will also create a strategy detailing what physician practices and the health-care sector can do to combat climate change.

This comes amid a growing sense that global warming is a threat to the health of people across the globe. And there’s a burgeoning sentiment that the health industry needs to be part of the response.

The new efforts are coming from the nation’s health department — which recently established an Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, though Congress is yet to fund its work — on down to medical professionals who traveled to Scotland for this year’s United Nations climate summit.

“Taking action now won’t reverse all of the harm done, but it will help prevent further damage to our planet and our patients’ health and well-being,” Ilse R. Levin, an AMA board member, said in a statement.

The latest

Here’s why advocates say climate change is a public health threat: Increasing temperatures have led to heat-related illness. Climate change has become a persistent danger to food security. El Niño weather patterns cause about 6 million children to go hungry — and could increase as the planet warms.

Over the years, there’s been a notable shift among the health profession in recognizing how rising global temperatures endanger the health of millions of people.

At the federal government

A case in point for how nascent some of the efforts are: The federal health department’s Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, which was created last summer, doesn’t yet have a dedicated pot of funding. (For a deep dive into that office, read more from Politico’s Sarah Owermohle.)

The Department of Health and Human Services recently established another venture. Late last month, HHS created the Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ), which will be housed inside the climate change office and tasked with tackling long-standing health issues disproportionately impacting marginalized communities, like pollution and other environmental health issues.

But since Congress hasn’t yet funded the effort, that has meant the growing staff — many of whom have previously worked in the environmental justice space — are detailed from other parts of the federal government.

“Once we get our funding, we can actually do more, but we're going to do as much as we can, we're going to do all we can, to really put those communities first,” Sharunda Buchanan, the office’s interim director, recently told The Health 202

Among the office’s first tasks: Sifting through public comments, which are due at the end of the week, on a draft outline of HHS’s environmental justice strategy. The office is also working to find points of contact across the federal health department who are already working on environmental justice efforts to be part of a working group to implement the strategic plan.

“Environmental justice and health are inextricably linked,” Buchanan said. “If you find an environmental injustice, you’re likely going to find some health issue.”

Poll check

A majority of Americans say transgender women should stay out of women's sports

Most Americans oppose allowing transgender women athletes to compete against female athletes at the professional, college and high school level, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.

The poll, conducted among 1,503 people across the United States, finds 55 percent of Americans opposed to allowing transgender women and girls to compete with other women and girls in high school sports and 58 percent opposed to it for college and professional sports, Tara Bahrampour, Emily Guskin and Scott Clement write. About 3 in 10 Americans said transgender women and girls should be allowed to compete at each of those levels, while an additional 15 percent have no opinion.

Daybook

On tap today: House leaders decided to avoid a brewing partisan fight over security arrangements for families of Supreme Court justices and employees. The chamber will vote today on a Senate-passed bill to extend security to family members of Supreme Court justices, but not family of judicial clerks or staffers.

The shift in strategy came after an unusual public ultimatum from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) last night, who threatened passage of the House bill, The Post’s Mike DeBonis reports. “The security issue is related to the Supreme Court justices, not to nameless staff that no one knows,” McConnell told reporters yesterday in a rare Capitol hallway interview.

Coronavirus

HHS secretary tests positive for the coronavirus — again

HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra tested positive for the coronavirus for the second time in roughly a month, HHS spokesperson Sarah Lovenheim said in a statement.

The details: Becerra is currently experiencing mild symptoms and is not considered a close contact of either President Biden or Vice President Harris.

Becerra initially tested positive for the virus on May 18, after which he was treated with Pfizer’s Paxlovid — an antiviral drug used to prevent severe illness from covid-19. Some patients who have taken the medication report experiencing a recurrence in their symptoms between 2 and 8 days after completing the treatment. Becerra’s latest positive test is less likely to be classified as a rebound since it falls outside that timeframe, according to HHS.

Agency alert

Baby formula plants weren’t inspected because of covid-19

Federal regulators didn’t inspect facilities owned and operated by three of the nation's leading infant formula manufacturers — Abbott, Reckitt and Gerber — for up to two-and-a-half years due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to federal records reviewed by the Associated Press.

The gap in formula plant inspections is under new scrutiny from lawmakers, who are investigating a series of missteps that led to a nationwide shortage and left parents scrambling for a way to feed their children.

Key context: Federal law requires the Food and Drug Administration to inspect formula facilities every three to five years, but the agency has consistently inspected plants annually until the pandemic. When the agency pulled most of its safety inspectors from the field in 2020, it said it skipped about 15,000 formula plant inspections.

One of those plants — a facility owned by Abbott Nutrition in Sturgis, Mich. — would later become embroiled in the heart of the national formula shortage after it was shut down for four months by federal regulators who alleged unsanitary conditions at the site. The plant reopened earlier this month.

The FDA resumed regular inspections in July 2021 but has still yet to return to one key Reckitt plant and two owned by Gerber, according to agency records. All of those facilities are currently operating around-the-clock to boost U.S. formula production, AP’s Matthew Perrone writes.

HHS lays out post-pandemic audio-only telemedicine guidelines

The federal health department yesterday released new guidelines explaining how health-care providers can stay in compliance with federal medical privacy laws when offering audio-only telemedicine services, including once regulatory flexibilities allowed during the pandemic lapse.

To comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), health-care workers should conduct appointments in private settings and take steps to verify their patients’ identity, among other safeguards.

Advertisement

The rule does not apply to telemedicine conducted over landlines because the information transmitted is not electronic, unlike mobile technologies that rely on cellular and WiFi networks.

Key context: To quickly expand the availability of remote health-care services in the early days of the pandemic, the agency said it would not impose penalties against telemedicine providers attempting to comply with HIPAA in “good faith.” That policy is expected to end either when HHS lifts its covid-19 public health emergency declaration or it is allowed to expire.

Why it matters: Audio-only telehealth has emerged as a critical tool to address virtual care disparities and reach patients in rural communities, individuals with disabilities and those without access to the internet.

Reproductive wars

In Missouri, battles over birth control foreshadow a post-Roe world

Missouri could become the next front in the battle over birth control — and may portend what’s to come from other states in a post-Roe world, the New York Times reports.

Some state GOP lawmakers have signaled that they may attempt to revive a failed effort to ban taxpayer funding for two common methods of preventing pregnancy: intrauterine devices and emergency contraception, also known as Plan B, should Roe fall.

Experts say the demise of Roe would make the need for effective birth control more urgent than ever. But nearly six decades after the Supreme Court guaranteed the right to contraception — and over a decade after the Affordable Care Act required private insurers cover it — birth control is still not accessible to all Americans.

National leaders in the antiabortion movement say their next push will be to ban medication abortion, and that birth control isn’t on their radar. Some Republicans on the far right have sought to limit access to emergency contraception.

But still, birth control access in Missouri and in other states may be getting harder. In February, the state became the fourth in the nation to eject Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program, in a move the organization says violates federal law, Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports.

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill … Congressional Democrats are pushing to expand access to birth control. Last week, they introduced legislation to require insurers to fully cover any FDA-approved birth control pills, including emergency contraception.

Consumers worry over climate impacts on food prices,"Consumers are worried that climate change will drive food prices higher, a newly launched quarterly survey shows.

The survey from the University of Illinois showed that American consumers are “more than somewhat worried” about climate change’s effect on food production, supplies and the livelihoods of farmers, just as Congress begins discussions of a five-year farm bill bound to touch on the subject.

Asked to rate their concerns on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being not concerned at all, respondents put their concerns about climate-driven food prices at a 5.3, and food shortages and negative impacts on farmers and ranchers at 5, according to the university, which outlined the results on its Farmdoc Daily blog Friday.

The quarterly online Gardner Food and Agriculture Policy Survey reaches about 1,000 people, according to the university, which conducted the initial survey in May.

While the survey indicated widespread worry over climate change generally, results varied from region to region, with the greatest concern in the West and Northeast. Respondents in the Midwest showed the greatest percentage who were not at all worried, at 9.6 percent.

Public sentiment on climate change will be “incredibly important” as lawmakers write the next farm bill, said Lesley Jantarasami, managing director for the energy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a centrist think tank that’s pursuing climate-smart agriculture in the farm bill. The last farm bill was in 2018.

Consumer attitudes are reflected in major food companies’ strategies to reduce their greenhouse gas impacts, and climate change is poised to be an important part of the debate over the bill regardless of which party has a majority in Congress when it’s finalized, Jantarasami told E&E News.

“The science has become much stronger since 2018,” she said.

Republicans, especially in the House, have criticized Democrats for their heavy focus on climate change, however, and have sought to pin high food prices primarily on the Biden administration’s economic policies. But groups like the BPC say compromises on climate policy and agriculture can be found.

“We’re all about finding that middle ground,” Jantarasami said.

Sponsors said the survey began as a way to keep track of public opinion ahead of the farm bill, which will reauthorize programs across the Department of Agriculture — and to put a fresh perspective on the related policy debates.

“Discussions of farm policy tend to focus on the farmer perspective and can sometimes exclude the perspectives of the general public. Rarely do we discuss agricultural policies from the perspective of the taxpayer, yet they are an important stakeholder,” researchers at the University of Illinois and Purdue University wrote in the Farmdoc Daily blog earlier this month.

Jantarasami said that while sections of the last farm bill — written by a Republican-led Congress — made references to climate change, the issue will play out more significantly in other parts of the bill this time, through programs on conservation assistance to farmers and potentially increased funding for land grant universities and agriculture extension services.

The survey also showed that 75 percent of respondents were either very worried or somewhat worried about climate change generally, and 7.7 percent said they weren’t worried at all. The survey will continue to monitor public support for a variety of climate change policies, the authors said.",,[],['Marc Heller']
Why investors suddenly care about saving the environment,"Here’s a big number: $44 trillion.

That’s how much of the world’s total economic output is dependent on animals and ecosystems, according to the World Economic Forum. Insects pollinate commercial crops, coral reefs protect coastal buildings, wetlands purify water, and all of those services — and more — help fuel economic growth.

If the economy is embedded in nature, then the global decline of wildlife and ecosystems is a risk for companies and investors alike. If insects vanish from farmland, say, farmers might have to pay to import pollinators or produce less, which hurts their bottom lines. That’s one reason why WEF ranks “biodiversity loss” as the third most severe risk to the economy over the next decade, after failure to act on climate change and extreme weather.

“The risk of continued biodiversity loss is profound,” Sarah Kapnick, a scientist and strategist at the banking giant JP Morgan, wrote in May, “not just for nature but for financial stability.”

In the last few years, the financial industry has been wising up to these risks. Along with banks and insurers, large investors have started pushing companies to disclose risks linked to the natural environment — known as nature-related risks — that might make their investments lose value over time. And in March, a group called the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures released a draft of a framework it hopes will be the gold standard for reporting and managing environmental risks. (There’s already a similar standard for reporting on risks tied to climate change.)

This movement around risk disclosure may sound obscure, but it has big potential to transform the global economy. Disclosing nature-related risks could redirect large flows of money from companies that rely on — and often harm — nature to those with a much smaller footprint, said Lucian Peppelenbos, a climate strategist at the investment firm Robeco. That’s the theory, anyway.

But today, efforts to quantify what companies have to lose as the environment deteriorates are a mess. There are dozens of metrics, tools, and frameworks, each with their own forgettable acronym. Tools to measure how companies impact nature are confusing, too — as are the variety of different standards for disclosing risk, even to experts in sustainable finance.

That’s not to say that this frontier of sustainable investing won’t be groundbreaking, or at least better than what’s already out there. But there’s a lot of work to be done, both around unifying reporting standards and measuring risk. It starts with answering a seemingly basic question: How do ecosystems work?

The many economic risks tied to the natural world, and its decline

Factoring environmental risk into investment decisions sounds smart, but actually doing it is a bit of a doozy — not least because there are several different kinds of risk and each one is tough to measure.

First, consider something called physical risk. It describes how dependent a given company and its investors are on services provided by nature, such as clean water and pollinators. A company that sells chocolate, for example, would almost certainly rely on wild insects for pollination in its supply chain (cacao plants are wholly dependent on them). It would also depend on fresh water and tools to manage pests — those are all physical risks, when you consider that ecosystems are faltering.

This isn’t just a hypothetical scenario. Three-quarters of the world’s food crops (and a third of global crop production) depend to some extent on pollination from birds, bees, and many other insects and small animals. And some insect populations have fallen by more than 70 percent in just a few decades. In fact, there are farmers in California who already pay to import bees because there aren’t enough local pollinators. That could eat into investor returns.

There are also risks rooted in the impacts that companies have on nature — essentially, the opposite of what we’ve been talking about. Most obviously, harming the environment can damage a corporation’s reputation, which is closely tied to its share price. Investors and banks may be less likely to back a company that sells palm oil from clearcut land, for example, for fear the public might find out and send the company’s stock tumbling.

There’s also a related concern called transition risk — the potential hit a company and its investors might take due to a future change in policy or consumer behavior. Consider a business that mines lithium in a region with endangered flamingos. If, in a few months time, the government decides to protect that particular area, the company might be forced to move its operations elsewhere and it would likely lose money as a result.

These risks are all hard to calculate. That’s partly because cultural and political sentiments are constantly in flux, and because scientists still don’t understand precisely how ecosystems work, or how to predict when they’ll change.

Tools to measure and report risks abound. Do they work?

Financial institutions that earnestly want to calculate biodiversity risks have a smorgasbord of acronym-laden options to choose from. There are tools, for example, that measure physical risks, such as ENCORE (Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks, and Exposure), or that assess a company’s impact on nature, including CBF (Corporate Biodiversity Footprint) and BFFI (Biodiversity Footprint for Financial Institutions). Others provide companies with a framework — and vocabulary — for reporting on risks and impacts, such as GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), SBT (Science Based Targets), and the recently launched TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure).

It can be hard to tell one from another, but in general these tools are designed to measure nature-related risks or provide a way to disclose them. They fall under the loosely defined category of ESG, a set of criteria to screen investments for risks related to the environment, social issues, or corporate governance (hence the acronym ESG), but they focus more narrowly on nature. And while ESG is relevant to retail investors, such as employees selecting funds for a retirement account, these risk tools are more for corporations, institutional investors, and other financial-industry heavyweights. (Unlike many ESG funds, they also factor in how companies are impacting the environment, not just how the environment impacts companies.)

If you can’t remember all the acronyms, at least remember this: These tools are far from perfect, largely for the simple reason that ecosystems are complicated, said Partha Dasgupta, an economist at Cambridge University, who wrote a well-known report in 2021 on the economics of biodiversity. We still don’t understand, for example, why exactly insect pollinators are declining or how different species contribute to ecosystem services that companies use.

Think about how the interworkings of an ecosystem compare to the technology of a car, Dasgupta said. Car manufacturers want engineers who understand how to turn raw materials into an automobile: “They’ll be able to tell you all the steps you need to take and the risks involved,” he said, from shaping metal sheets to painting the exterior. “They keep spare parts because if something breaks down they can immediately replace it. They understand the technology. The thing is, we don’t understand the technology of nature.”

Measuring a company’s impact on nature, and the related financial risks, isn’t much easier. It’s not like climate change, where you can stack up companies by their annual carbon emissions. “Within climate change, there’s a set accounting methodology for coming up with your greenhouse gas emissions,” said Julie Nash, the senior program director for foods and forests at the nonprofit Ceres. “It’s much harder with biodiversity to have that one single metric.”

Indeed, biodiversity is a broad term that includes all ecosystems, on land and at sea, from boreal forests to coral reefs. Each has its own assemblage of organisms. And each organism has a different function. So, when you measure biodiversity — as a means to understand financial risk — what exactly do you measure, and how? The number of species in a given area? What specific roles they play in their environment? Scientists have debated these questions for years.

Even more foundational questions lack answers, such as how many species there are on Earth. Without that information, we don’t know exactly what there is to lose.

All this work will be tedious. But it could help make a greener economy

So, where does that leave us? Financial institutions have a lot of work on their plates — they need to come up with better metrics and consolidate the myriad reporting tools already out there. But experts are optimistic.

“I think it’s going to be a mess for a while,” Aled Jones, a professor of sustainable finance at Anglia Ruskin University, told Vox. “But we will make progress on disclosure.”

It’s worth remembering that just 10 years back, hardly anyone was comparing companies by their greenhouse gas footprints, but now that information is readily available.

“Let’s not forget that 10 to 15 years ago no one in business was talking about scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions,” said Tony Goldner, the executive director of TNFD, referring to three ways to categorize climate emissions from companies (writer David Roberts does a good job at explaining scope emissions here). “There’s a whole process the market has gone through to get off the curb on climate, which we’re now going to need to do on nature.”

To that end, Dasgupta and others see a rising demand for the types of thinkers who can help solve risk assessment problems. “Treasuries and ministries and companies have to hire ecologists,” Dasgupta said, adding that they’d be unwise not to. “It’d be like a car manufacturer who doesn’t have any engineers. It’s absurd.”

While all this risk calculation seems very tedious — and to some it may seem ludicrous to put ecosystems and wildlife in financial terms at all — it’s important to come back to the main goal: “Ultimately, we aim to shift the flow of capital,” Goldner said, to companies that are less harmful to the environment.

And it’s fun to think about what that might actually look like. Imagine that the US government requires that all public companies disclose their environmental risks. So, our hypothetical chocolate company would have to indicate how, for example, changes to wild insect populations would affect its products, and how its products would, in turn, impact insects.

Investors and lenders might then expect a larger return, in line with the added risk they’re taking on. As the company faces higher costs of capital, they may respond in ways that reduce nature-related risks to attract investment, such as switching to less harmful pesticides. If drought is also a problem for the company, perhaps it’ll lobby for climate action to protect its own assets.

Okay, so maybe there’s a bit of wishful thinking in this scenario — it’s not easy to reform the economy, and just disclosing risks doesn’t mean companies or investors will do anything differently. But efforts like TNFD’s are a good place to start. And if nothing else, they’ll help us learn more about the world we live in, and how seemingly distant ecosystems and animals are holding up a large chunk of the world’s economy.

Homebuilder sentiment drops to lowest level in two years as housing demand slows,"A contractor frames a house under construction in Lehi, Utah, U.S., on Wednesday, Dec. 16, 2020. Private residential construction in the U.S. rose 2.7% in November.

Sentiment among the nation's homebuilders fell for the sixth straight month to the lowest level since June 2020, when the economy was grappling with shutdowns stemming from the Covid pandemic.

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index fell 2 points to 67 in June. Anything above 50 is considered positive. The index hit 90 at the end of 2020, as the pandemic spurred strong demand for larger homes in the suburbs.

Of the index's three components, buyer traffic fell 5 points to 48, the first time it has fallen into negative territory since June 2020. Current sales conditions fell 1 point to 77, and sales expectations in the next six months fell 2 points to 61.

""Six consecutive monthly declines for the HMI is a clear sign of a slowing housing market in a high-inflation, slow-growth economic environment,"" said NAHB Chairman Jerry Konter. ""The entry-level market has been particularly affected by declines for housing affordability and builders are adopting a more cautious stance as demand softens with higher mortgage rates.""

The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has risen sharply since the start of the year. In January it was right around 3.25%, and as of Tuesday it hit 6.28%, according to Mortgage News Daily. Mortgage demand has fallen to less than half of what it was a year ago.

Builders also continue to face supply-side challenges.

""Residential construction material costs are up 19% year-over-year with cost increases for a variety of building inputs, except for lumber, which has experienced recent declines due to a housing slowdown,"" wrote Robert Dietz, NAHB's chief economist.

Regionally, on a three-month moving average, sentiment in the Northeast fell 1 point to 71. In the Midwest it dropped 6 points to 56. In the South it fell 2 points to 78, and in the West it dropped 9 points to 74.",,[],"['Diana Olick', 'In Dianaolick']"
House Republicans' climate strategy draws Democrats' jeers,"Placeholder while article actions load

Good morning and welcome to The Climate 202! As a scheduling note, the newsletter won't publish tomorrow — we have a short week with the congressional recess. But first: House Republicans' climate strategy draws Democrats' jeers Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) plans to unveil a strategy today outlining how Republicans would address climate change, energy and environmental issues if the party gains control of the House in the midterm elections, according to three individuals familiar with the matter, Maxine and our colleague Jeff Stein scooped on Wednesday evening.

The strategy calls for streamlining the permitting process for large infrastructure projects, increasing domestic fossil fuel production and boosting exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, which proponents say is cleaner than gas produced in other countries, according to the individuals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe details that are not yet public.

However, the GOP plan drew immediate criticism from congressional Democrats, who noted that leading scientists have said the world must rapidly phase out fossil fuels to stave off catastrophic consequences of the climate crisis.

To meet the more ambitious goal of the 2015 Paris agreement, the world must eliminate coal use within 30 years, according to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Gas dependence should be reduced by 45 percent, while oil use must fall 60 percent by the middle of the century, the IPCC said in a recent report that concluded humanity is running out of time to meet global climate goals.

“I welcome the efforts of anyone, regardless of party, who is willing to seriously tackle climate change — but on its face this does not look like a serious proposal,” said Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.). “Most people understand that a serious climate solution requires a shift toward cleaner sources of energy, but the Republicans apparently want to take us in the opposite direction, with more dependence on dangerous, dirty energy sources.”

Advertisement

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who has been participating in bipartisan energy talks led by Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), echoed that sentiment.

“Any climate plan must be judged on whether it reduces emissions and invests in renewables to diversify energy sources and bring a long-term reduction and stability in prices for all Americans,” Khanna said. “Based on what's been reported, this plan is just a Big Oil wish list.”

Rep. Melanie Ann Stansbury (D-N.M.) cautioned against undermining the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental consequences of major actions, in order to accelerate the permitting process. “This plan is out of touch with reality and is an end-run around environmental protections that have been in place for decades,” she said.

Advertisement

McCarthy, who would probably become speaker if the GOP picks up enough seats in the midterms, last year tapped Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) to lead a task force on climate, energy and conservation. The strategy is the result of months of deliberations within that task force, which includes 17 GOP members.

Spokespeople for McCarthy and Graves declined to comment on the record ahead of today's official rollout.

The House GOP plan comes as Republicans seek to make gains with educated suburban voters in November’s elections. Some of these voters may want to see Republicans take a more proactive stance on climate change and energy policy, rather than letting Democrats dominate the debate, said George David Banks, a Republican climate policy expert who served as a White House climate adviser under President Donald Trump.

“It’s the competitive seats that make a difference,” he said. “And most of those run through the suburbs. So there’s certainly a recognition that you’ve got to win a critical mass of those to control the House.”

Correction: A previous version of this item incorrectly said Rep. Melanie Ann Stansbury represents a district in Arizona. She represents a district in New Mexico.

National Hurricane Center director expects another monster season

Wednesday marked the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season, and it's expected to be another active one.

In its annual seasonal outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast the seventh-straight above-normal Atlantic season, with 14 to 21 named storms — compared with 14 in an average year — and three to six major hurricanes.

The Climate 202 spoke virtually on Wednesday with Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center, about the link between climate change and supercharged storms. The following Q&A has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity:

Climate 202: How is climate change playing a role in more intense hurricanes?

Graham: In a warmer climate, we're starting to see heavier rainfall — not just in terms of the total amount, but also in terms of the rainfall rates. That's important, because if you get three to five inches of rain in an hour, that's a big difference from getting three to five inches of rain over a 24-hour period. And that will continue to have a significant impact on inland flooding.

The other thing is that with sea-level rise, the water from storm surge could be higher and could push farther inland. So areas that never experienced storm surge in the past could experience storm surge in the future.

Climate 202: The 2021 hurricane season produced 21 named storms, the third-most on record, exhausting all of the names of the National Hurricane Center’s conventional naming list. Could that happen again this year?

Graham: Yes. I mean, look at the forecast. We're forecasting 14 to 21 named storms, and if we get 21, we'll run out of names once again. That's not a common thing. We've only run out of names in 2005 and then again in 2020 and 2021. To have that happen two years in a row was pretty significant.

That being said, scientists still aren't sure whether climate change is increasing the number of storms. We have technology now from aircraft data and satellite data, so we're actually seeing more storms and naming more storms than we were before.

The power grid

Much of the country could face blackouts this summer as temperatures rise

The nation's power grid is facing unprecedented stress, with regulators warning that rolling outages — familiar in states like Texas and California — could affect large areas of the country as an abnormally hot summer arrives, The Washington Post’s Evan Halper reports.

Already, New Mexico’s attorney general has launched a readiness task force to prepare for “worst-case scenarios,” while Arkansas power officials are establishing emergency conservation measures.

The unexpected warnings come as extreme weather tied to climate change strains the grid, and as the nation shuts down fossil fuel plants to help reach carbon neutrality by 2050.

Pressure points

New York suspends its gas tax in response to rising costs

In an effort to address high gasoline prices, New York on Wednesday became the latest state to temporarily suspend its gas tax ahead of the travel-heavy summer months, The Post's Tony Romm reports.

The decision, which halted the state’s roughly 16-cents-per-gallon charge through the end of the year, came as the average cost of unleaded gasoline nationwide exceeded $4.67 per gallon, according to AAA.

At the same time, high fuel prices stem from a complicated combination of economic and geopolitical forces, Abha Bhattarai reports as part of The Post's ECON 101 series. The economy’s rapid recovery from the pandemic created more demand for gasoline, pushing prices higher. Then, the invasion of Ukraine led to a global backlash against Russia, which produces more oil than all but two other countries, so prices rose again.

Another oil company backs out of Arctic leases

Regenerate Alaska has canceled the lease that it purchased in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge last year, becoming the latest company to abandon plans for oil and gas drilling in the 19-million-acre refuge, Alex DeMarban reports for the Anchorage Daily News. The Trump administration had sold the lease in its final days in January 2021.

Last week, Hilcorp and Chevron also exited separate leases on Indigenous-owned land in the refuge. Those companies spent $10 million to withdraw from their deal with Arctic Slope Regional Corp.

Harris unveils plan to ‘elevate’ water security in foreign policy

Vice President Harris on Wednesday announced an action plan that considers water security as a national security issue, Rachel Frazin reports for the Hill.

The White House Action Plan on Global Water Security outlines how the United States will use diplomatic resources to help ensure access to safe drinking water and sanitation services around the world. It comes as America faces water issues of its own, with roughly 76 percent of the West suffering from a severe drought fueled by climate change.

In a speech, Harris noted that water insecurity can drive migration and armed conflicts. “This action plan will help our country prevent conflict and advance cooperation among nations, increase equity and economic growth, and make our world more inclusive and resilient,” she said.

Agency alert

Haaland tests positive for coronavirus

Interior Secretary Deb Haaland tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday and has mild symptoms, the agency said in a statement. She tested negative during a visit to the White House on Monday and was not in close contact with President Biden.

Haaland, who is fully vaccinated and has received two booster shots, is quarantining in Nevada, where she participated in a roundtable discussion on Tuesday about increasing clean energy development on public lands. She has canceled travel plans elsewhere in the American West.

How climate change is steering the wheel of real estate in India,"“The idea is not to test the limits of our planet and find out how much more damage it can take, but to come together and begin restoration and reversal. We owe it to every generation that comes after.” – Ratan Tata

In essence, this quote encapsulates the meta-sentiment surrounding climate change and vows to cut carbon footprints across all industries. The real estate sector is a crucial driver of the Indian economy, contributing roughly 6-7 percent to GDP and accounting for 22 percent of all emissions in the country due to its type of business.

India is dedicated to achieving the United Nations’ sustainable development targets of reducing its carbon footprint by 30-35 percent by 2030. To meet climate pledges, the real estate and construction industries must change their business practises. This path to sustainability comes at a cost to the industry, which includes an increase in the cost of building construction and upkeep.

Climate change is a global challenge that poses risks to society, economy and the natural environment. It can be mitigated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions or adapting to a world with a warmer climate. The impact of climate change on real estate is expected to be widespread, significant, and challenging for real estate investors and developers. Real estate is an asset class which will be directly impacted by climate change in several ways.

Climate Change Implications on Real Estate in India

These climatic changes pose challenges to real estate in India in terms such as – increased construction costs due to climatic changes, challenges in designing buildings, and changes in the need for real estate. These changes are expected to have a long-term impact on real estate in India.

Increased Construction Costs Due to Climatic Changes

Construction is a cyclical industry, where changes in the economic climate have a significant impact on the sector. A rise in the cost of construction will be a significant risk for real estate investors. The construction costs are expected to increase due to climate change, mainly due to a rise in the prices of materials. As more regions are affected by droughts and flooding associated with climate change, the price of sand and gravel which is the key ingredient used in the production of concrete, will rise further.

Government’s role to curtail the risk for climate change

The government needs to acknowledge the threat of climate change in realty, find ways to mitigate the risk, and put in place policies for adapting to the changing climate. There are certain policies that the government can put in place to check the impact of climate change and protect real estate from its dangers. Some of them are – The government can use its money and resources to collect and analyse data related to climate change. This will help them in getting insights into the impact of climate change on real estate and help in devising policies to combat its effects.

Role of Real Estate Developers and Investors in mitigating climate change

Investors can use eco-friendly construction materials in their projects to combat the threat of climate change. Some of the materials that can be used are – These materials are eco-friendly and can be used in the construction of buildings to lower the carbon footprint.

Developers can use energy efficient designs for their projects to lower the cost of energy and tackle the threat of climate change. Some of the ways in which they can do this are – These designs will help in lowering the cost of energy and protecting the environment.

Tackle the threat of climate change in realty

Real estate is an asset class which will be directly impacted by climate change in several ways. While climate change poses challenges to real estate, it also creates new opportunities for investors and developers. Given the long-term nature of real estate investments, investors and developers are well-positioned to adapt to the changing climate and reap the benefits of growing global demand for sustainable and eco-friendly buildings.

Climate change education coming to NJ schools in September,"This academic year may be winding down, but schools in New Jersey are already preparing to add climate change to their lesson plans for September.

Updated learning standards adopted in June 2020 will be implemented when students return from summer break.

The move made New Jersey the first state in the nation to incorporate climate change education in grades K through 12.

The standards adopted by the state Board of Education call for climate change instruction across several content areas: career readiness; life literacies and key skills; comprehensive health and physical education; computer science and design thinking; science; social studies; visual and performing arts; and world languages.

""Many of the children who enter kindergarten this coming September will likely live into the 22nd century,"" said Larry Feinsod, executive director of the New Jersey School Boards Association. ""The future that awaits them will be greatly impacted, to say the least, by global warming.""

NJSBA, along with Sustainable Jersey, released a 36-page report earlier this year to help schools incorporate the necessary instruction throughout their curricula. Included in the report was a series of recommendations for schools to get in line with by June 2022.

""By teaching the topic across subject areas, as is required by the new learning standards, the goal is to give the leaders of tomorrow the full breadth of what they need to know to find and implement solutions,"" Randy Solomon, executive director of Sustainable New Jersey, said with the release of the report.

In general, schools are advised to center their climate change education on what is happening locally — approaches that emphasize New Jersey-specific effects of climate change are likely to have more of an impact on students.

Schools are also being told to highlight the disproportionate impacts of climate change seen by communities of color, immigrant communities, and low-income communities.

"How the pawpaw, also known as a hillbilly mango, could be a climate change winner in NC","How the pawpaw, also known as a hillbilly mango, could be a climate change winner in NC

North Carolina isn't known for its tropical fruits. Neither is Missouri, West Virginia or southern Ontario, for that matter.

But likely unbeknownst to most Americans (and Canadians), the largest edible fruit tree native to North America grows in most states east of the Mississippi. And the taste of its fruit, which is full of healthy goodies like antioxidants, has been compared to a cross between a mango and a banana.

So why aren't pawpaw fruit and products overflowing at supermarkets and health food stores?

That's complicated, experts say. But with climate change expected to bring new challenges to the world's food supplies and supply chain issues already playing havoc with global trade, looking local is increasingly seen as a safe, viable and smart option for protecting and increasing food supplies.

Want pawpaw beer or cider? Prepare to look far and wide in North Carolina

But making pawpaw a staple in the American diet could be difficult.

Dr. Mike Parker, a tree fruit specialist with N.C. State University, said besides convincing those who might find the pawpaw's texture and taste difficult to stomach, there's a more basic issue.

“The problem is getting trees into production and getting the fruit to market,"" he said. ""Quite frankly, they rot too quickly.""

That doesn't mean, though, that some local communities haven't already discovered and embraced the humble pawpaw. That can be seen in the fruit's long list of local nicknames — Quaker delight, American custard apple, hillbilly mango and, now that it's got a growing ""cool"" reputation, hipster banana.

CLEAN AIR CONUNDRUM: Coastal areas love their clean air. A new study finds that hurricanes do, too

""It's just so different,"" said Derek Morris, a horticulture technician with the N.C. Cooperative Extension in Forsyth County who has helped organize the annual N.C. Pawpaw Festival in Winston-Salem for the past 15 years. ""It's like a magical fruit that shouldn't be here.""

The pawpaw patch

According to the United Nations, 13 crops provide 80% of people’s caloric intake worldwide, with about half of those calories coming from wheat, corn and rice. But some of these crops may not grow well in the higher temperatures, unpredictable rainfall and extreme weather events caused by climate change. Warmer temperatures are also expected to bring a new wave of pests and diseases to temperate areas, like much of the United States.

Enter the pawpaw, a tree that's surprisingly hardy and flexible in where it grows.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, pawpaws grow ""in the shade in open woods usually in wet, fertile bottomlands, but can grow in upland areas on rich soils."" They can form thick clusters when they grow in the understory of forests, often spreading quickly to create a “pawpaw patch.”

Adaptable in nearly all temperate climates, pawpaws require some period of cold weather to fruit. That means while their range extends into southern Canada, it doesn't grow much south of Gainesville, Florida.

The pawpaw also isn't some new exotic fruit that's just arrived on the scene. Spanish conquistadors reported eating pawpaws with Native Americans, and members of Lewis and Clark's expedition relied on the fruit while exploring the new Louisiana Purchase in the early 19th century. Urban legend has it that chilled pawpaws were also George Washington's favorite dessert.

From Manteo to Wilmington, could the 'kudzu of the coast' help fight climate change?

The tree, which is unusual in that it's pollinated by flies and beetles instead of bees, is also the exclusive host plant for the zebra swallowtail butterfly, which is viewed by many as one of the most beautiful butterflies in the world.

While native and covering a huge range, experts warn the pawpaw could have to endure some of the same challenges more common fruits and crops grown in the Eastern U.S. face as the climate changes and pests and diseases migrate along with the warmer weather.

“Just because it’s native, that doesn’t mean it's adapted to, if we want to call it, a changing climate,"" Parker said. ""But you would think it might be better able to tolerate some of those changes than other species.""

'A magical fruit'

Morris said people are fascinated by pawpaws, from its taste to the fact that trees with a mango-like fruit grows in their backyard.

But it can be an acquired taste for some.

""I have friends that like them and I have friends that won’t talk to me after eating them,"" Parker said with a laugh. ""It’s a very unique fruit.""

Morris echoed the sentiment.

CHANGING LANDSCAPE: On the Outer Banks, structures rise and fall as climate change looms

“It’s very different from any fruit we can grow here. And the flavor, that tropical flavor is very different,"" he said.

While some like eating the soft, custard-like pulp fresh from the fruit, Morris said most people use the fruit in products like hot sauces, baked goods, smoothies and desserts.

“I have yet to meet a person who doesn’t like pawpaw ice cream, even if they don’t like pawpaws,"" he added.

In recent years, the growth of fruity alcohols — including beer and spirits like brandy — has fueled a surge in pawpaw demand and popularity.

“It’s like a magical fruit,"" Morris said. ""It’s like something that shouldn’t be here.""

Not Big Ag friendly

In the United States the center of pawpaw research is Kentucky State University (KSU), which is home to the USDA's pawpaw gene bank.

While pawpaws — the origin of the name isn't fully known, although many believe it has Native American origins — have always been grown commercially in small numbers by some specialty farmers or collected in the wild by others for home use, KSU's Sheri Crabtree said the fruit's popularity has really taken off in the last two decades as the sustainable food movement has grown and more ""foodies"" seek out new and unique tastes.

""That it's unusual, rare and not something that's usually easy to get except at farmers markets or specialty stores has made it even more attractive to some,"" she said.

So why can't you find pawpaws in your neighborhood grocery's fruit aisle?

Blame a mix of modern farming techniques and people's desire for a food product year-round.

RELATED: Want pawpaw beer or cider? Prepare to look far and wide in North Carolina

Parker and Crabtree said pawpaws aren't the type of fruit that fits in easily to the business model of Big Agriculture.

""They bruise easily, and they have a very short shelf life when compared to other fruits and vegetables, which makes it difficult to ship and store,"" Crabtree said, noting that even in cold storage the fruit will likely only last for a few weeks.

Since pawpaws generally ripen in August or September, depending on how far north the trees are, that means the fruit is most often seen at markets in late summer or early fall. Pawpaw's short shelf life means the pulp is often removed from the fruit, frozen and then used in other products.

That could make it a challenge for pawpaws to enter mainstream American diets.

""But as a product for niche markets, it has great potential,"" Parker said. ""And if you know where to look, it already is.""

Tourism Outlook Remains Unclear as Improved Sentiment and Increasing Barriers May Collide,"Hotel performance data shows that tourism is largely ramping up globally due to eased travel restrictions, improved COVID-19 perceptions and strong underlying demand for travel. This trend is corroborated when assessing the latest consumer research findings gathered by STR in May 2022 among a sample of some 1,300 global travelers.

But how much have impressions of COVID-19 shifted in recent months and how do consumers cogitate on travel with challenges such as growing financial pressures and geopolitical uncertainty?



COVID-19 Concerns Are Shrinking but They Haven’t Gone Away

During the pandemic, STR has monitored the influence of COVID-19 as a reason for not booking or undertaking travel.

The latest data shows a continuation of the existing trend as consumers who had not booked travel in recent months apportioned less significance to COVID-19. The average influence score was 3.36 out of 5 compared with 3.64 in February 2022 and scores of above 4 out of 5 in previous research. These findings signal improved perceptions regarding the impact of the virus on travel. However, the average score of 3 out of 5 indicates that COVID-19 remains a noteworthy barrier for planning and undertaking travel among some consumers.

Travel Sentiment Has Improved Significantly

Propensity to travel in the current COVID-19 climate, defined as the likelihood to travel now compared with before the pandemic, remained in negative territory as consumers continue to perceive travel as less appealing overall in an era adapting to COVID-19.

However, compared with February 2022 findings, there was a marked uptick in sentiment. Net propensity to travel domestically was down 4% — versus down 20% in February — and net propensity to travel internationally was down 31% — versus down 56% in February.

These results underline continued struggles for the industry due to COVID-19. However, they also highlight a potential tipping point as the tide of opinion appears to have changed significantly compared with earlier in the year.



Rising Costs Are the Biggest Barrier to Travel Now

As global economies grapple with increasing inflationary pressures, which are contributing to erode real incomes, it is perhaps not surprising to see pronounced cost sensitivities among consumers.

The cost of travel was considered the highest barrier to travel overall in the next 12 months, mentioned by nearly 60% of all respondents. Among U.K. consumers, the pinch of increasing household costs — at a time of soaring energy and fuel prices and concerns regarding personal finances — particularly stood out. Meanwhile, for North Americans, perceived barriers related to COVID-19 were slightly more prominent — with 46% of those surveyed listing it as a travel concern, compared with 40% among Brits and Europeans. That is likely linked to continued testing requirements for inbound flights to the U.S., though that requirement was lifted June 12.

Financial considerations dominated the list of barriers. Uncertainty about the future economic situation also figured in the top seven barriers evaluated, mentioned by 30% of respondents overall and slightly fewer North Americans (26%). In addition to financial barriers and COVID-19 challenges, concerns about the war in Ukraine were cited by 38% of Europeans, 35% of North Americans and 31% of Brits, and could affect travel decisions in the next 12 months.

In the short to medium term, there could be a clash of conflicting forces as pent-up demand and improved sentiment toward travel meet global factors, particularly changing economic situations. The growth path for tourism could be dictated by the extent to which financial pressures tighten or loosen in the coming months. Strong underlying demand for travel is likely to continue among many, especially higher-earning consumers. However, travel demand may be displaced among others who are more sensitive to economic uncertainty and depreciation in real income.

Campaigners urge Asia to move faster on climate change,"For hundreds of years, since early Maori explorers first landed their waka in the sheltered bays of the Marlborough Sounds, the area’s cool blue waters have provided a seemingly limitless source of fish.

So, in April, New Zealanders were stunned to learn that the country’s largest salmon farming operation had, for months, been taking hundreds of truckloads of its prized export-bound Chinook species and dumping them in a nearby landfill — victims of a rapid rise in water temperatures.

Grant Rosewarne, chief executive of New Zealand King Salmon, told the national broadcaster that, in terms of global warming, cold-water fish are just the canary in the coal mine.

The US president’s top climate envoy, John Kerry, was similarly direct when he told an audience of global leaders in Davos last month that the world was atop a “precipice”.

He pointed to the disastrous effects of the planet’s addiction to fossil fuels, including 15mn annual deaths from air pollution and the gathering pace and intensity of natural disasters including droughts, fires, mudslides, floods and storms.

“We’re dealing with a crisis here, folks,” Kerry said. “It is a crisis made by human beings.” He was speaking to members of the World Economic Forum high in the Swiss Alps but, on almost every metric, the battle to stop global warming will largely be won or lost far to the east: in Asia-Pacific.

Investors and environmental watchdogs worry that the warnings are not getting through to Asia’s factories, energy providers, corporate boardrooms and corridors of power.

The region and its businesses, they say, are failing to respond with sufficient urgency to combat climate change.

The world’s most populous region and its most important growth engine is responsible for more than half of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. From lossmaking steel mills in China’s northern rustbelt to India’s swelling power sector, from South Korea’s semiconductor fabrication plants to Japan’s automakers, fossil fuels — mainly coal — still underpin the bulk of economic activity.

Most governments in the region have made long-term pledges to cut emissions, as have many of Asia’s biggest corporate polluters and energy users, including South Korean electronics group Samsung, Japanese car manufacturer Toyota, and India’s largest conglomerate, Tata.

But, at its current rate, environmental groups warn, the transition to renewable energy in Asia is nowhere near fast enough to arrest the rise in temperatures — as the mass fish deaths in the Marlborough Sounds demonstrate.

Bernadette Maheandiran, a research and legal analyst with Australia-based shareholder activist group Market Forces, cites the huge gap between Japanese companies’ promises of mitigation and concrete actions by executives in Tokyo.

“After the Japanese government made their net zero commitment, you saw a slew of Japanese corporations make similar commitments,” she says. “But what we’re seeing is the absence of an actual pathway to meet those commitments.”

The sentiment is echoed loudly and publicly by campaign groups across the region — and more quietly and privately by concerned policymakers and corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) teams. Many express growing frustration at inaction in the higher echelons of government and business.

According to investors and environmentalists, one of the most important keys that will unlock change in the region is simple: data.

Rather than paying lip service to the problem, companies could show they are serious about tackling emissions by releasing transparent data that can catalyse change. It would make them attractive to institutional investors and to increasingly environmentally focused consumers.

“We don’t have an issue with companies with big emissions [profiles] . . . because that is where there is the biggest scope for change,” says Anders Schelde, chief investment officer at Denmark’s Akademiker Pension, a member-owned pension fund. “The first step to take action is to start measuring. It really is a problem.”

The FT’s inaugural Asia-Pacific Climate Leaders list, compiled with Nikkei Asia and data provider Statista, aims to draw together what data there is, and to encourage companies to supply more of it. It identifies the 200 Asia-Pacific businesses that made the biggest cuts to their Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions — arising respectively from a company’s own operations and from the energy it purchases — relative to revenue between 2015 and 2020.

The list has limitations. Mainland China is excluded because of the unreliability of some corporate data. And Scope 3 emissions — from those parts of the value chain not covered by Scopes 1 and 2, and typically most of a company’s GHGs — are insufficiently disclosed to be factored in.

But the companies included are at least making a start — and some of those not featuring, such as Toyota, are striking.

Schelde says across Akademiker Pension’s portfolio, fewer than half the companies provide reliable emissions data. But, in Asia, including more developed markets such as Japan, the world’s third-biggest economy, there remains firm resistance to shareholder engagement and activism over climate change.

“My impression is the culture is less mature than in Europe and the US — companies are less used to investors approaching them and being critical,” he says. “In our part of the world, it is part of the way we do business.”

Maheandiran adds that companies in Asia must not only improve disclosure of their own emissions and be more transparent about their carbon pricing assumptions, but do so “across their entire supply chains”.

These shortcomings appear to be reflected within corporate hierarchies. While companies have hired ESG specialists, they lack the clout of their European and US counterparts.

“The whole thing about sustainability and purpose and corporate responsibility, it is much more in the boardrooms in our part of the world,” says Schelde.

However, national policies and history are also partly to blame.

Governments across the region — including those of China and India, the biggest GHG emitters — have long bristled at being urged by the west to implement costly overhauls of their energy and industry sectors before achieving the levels of development seen in Europe and the US.

They point out that the same western countries that are now among the loudest climate campaigners enjoyed growth underpinned since pre-industrial times by coal and oil. The US, for example, is the world’s biggest emitter historically, and still second only to China today. They note, too, that the west has benefited for decades from cheap manufacturing in Asia, while overlooking the fact the region’s industries are powered by coal.

Last year, as the international community rallied to make more ambitious national emissions reductions at the COP26 UN climate change conference in Glasgow, Asia’s coal-fired power plants and energy-intensive factories were intensely busy, serving a post-pandemic rebound in industrial demand. Emissions surged.

Little wonder that China and India, insisted — successfully — that COP26 water down a proposed commitment to “phase out” coal so that it became one to “phase down” its use.

While the amount of coal power plant capacity under development declined in most regions in 2021, advanced economies in East Asia were the exception, according to data from a network of non-governmental organisations, including Global Energy Monitor, Solutions for Our Climate and the Sierra Club.

“There is simply no carbon budget left to be building new coal plants,” says Flora Champenois, an analyst at GEM. “We need to stop, now.”

Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption to Russian oil and gas supplies have further complicated the outlook, with rocketing inflation and fears of commodity shortages prompting governments to reprioritise energy security over the climate response.

Still, environmentalists and investors are holding out hope the transition to renewable energy can be fast tracked in Asia. They say this can be achieved by leaps into low-cost solar and offshore wind generation and adoption of electric transport fleets, along with efficient use of capital and carbon pricing.

If the polluters don’t move, we are doomed. If innovators accelerate, the world benefits

Investors, too, are eagerly hunting for opportunities to support the transition to renewables and cleaner fuels — despite their frustration over the distance between countries’ climate commitments and the reality of massive fossil fuel dependency and deforestation in the region.

Li Shuo, an energy expert with Greenpeace in Beijing, suggests there is still cause for optimism as Asia could “spearhead the clean tech transition” in energy sectors including solar and electric vehicles.

“The solar industry did not exist in China 10 years ago; now it is the dominant player on the world stage,” Li points out. “That demonstrates how Chinese companies are good at leveraging favourable government policies [and] its domestic market, and [at] perfecting complex supply chains to be cost competitive.”

“It is not an exaggeration to say companies in Asia hold the key to our climate challenge. If the polluters don’t move, we are doomed. If

the innovators accelerate, the world benefits from the solutions they provide.”

Democrats optimistic Manchin will cooperate on climate bill,"Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) surprised many by deciding not to vote for Build Back Better last-minute in late December.

Last December, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) sent a shockwave through the renewable energy industry, suddenly pulling back his must-have vote to push through the Biden administration’s Build Back Better Act (BBBA), a $1.75 trillion spending plan that included a $550 billion climate package with significant incentives for the domestic manufacture of components throughout the entire solar value chain.

This week, the Biden Administration took executive action, including invoking the Defense Production Act and designating “super preference” for the federal procurement of solar goods, to lay the groundwork for a US-made solar supply chain. While industry leaders lauded the move, which coincided with a freeze of solar tariff imports for two years, the impact is expected to be minimal compared to what the BBBA could have provided.

Industry leaders and climate advocates have been calling for long-term industrial policy to create market certainty so the “solar coaster” can stabilize, and energy decarbonization can accelerate at levels needed to fend off the worst-case climate disaster scenario. Such policies would include the domestic manufacturing tax credits, and a long-term extension of the solar investment tax credit, which is planned to phase out from 26% this year to 10% by 2024 for commercial and utility-scale solar, and 0% for residential solar.

When Manchin announced he would not vote for BBBA in December, it was viewed as dead in the water. But now, sentiment among Democrats suggests there may be a deal on the way. Sen. Manchin has been meeting privately with majority leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to discuss what it will take to earn his vote.

“Sen. Schumer and Sen. Manchin are keeping this very close to the vest, and I actually think that’s a good sign,” Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) told E&E News. “I’ve believed for a long time that the basic contours of an agreement have been kind of out there,” she added.

Democrats are aiming for the beginning of the August recess as a deadline, with fall midterm elections looming. “I haven’t heard anyone say, ‘Climate can be done another day,’” said Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Despite this optimism, Manchin told CNN this week there is currently no deal. “The bottom line is how do we fight inflation?” He said. “That’s all. If they’re not serious about really getting our financial house in order and fighting inflation, paying down debt, then it’s all for naught.”

“It’s all in Sen. Schumer’s hands,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) “(Schumer) informs us that there’s progress being made. There’s still a lot more to be done.”

US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said the infrastructure law passed last year was “the spine of the president’s clean energy and energy future agenda, but the tax credits (in the reconciliation bill) are the lungs of it,” Granholm told POLITICO’s Sustainability Summit. “They absolutely need to pass and I am feeling actually pretty bullish about it at this very moment.”",,[],"['Ryan Kennedy', 'Ryan Joined Pv Magazine In', 'Bringing Experience A Top Residential Solar Installer', 'A U.

OPINION | Heed the youth on climate change,"To end the climate wars globally, those of us with the means to do so need to urgently promote and amplify new stories and narratives that connect to and reflect the values and views of the world’s youth.

The idea that climate action can encompass a positive vision for the future — not just for the West but everyone — must be central to the stories we tell. Sharing these stories can serve as a catalyst for delivering on the hopes and dreams of billions of people.

Fortunately, young people are powerful storytellers and are already using their own experiences to lead movements. They are already being heard and now, they must be listened to.

A definitive cliche of COP26 in Glasgow is that it resulted in division, blame sharing, inaction and deadlock. Rich economies failed again to provide the levels of financing promised for so long while simultaneously (and hypocritically) pressuring developing economies to step up. Some emerging economies essentially said they will wait for the “rich world” to push the financial envelope forward before rushing to meet the challenges of a global disaster they refuse to feel — and arguably, historically at least, are not — co-responsible for.

And all the while, seemingly abandoned and unheard, the world’s most vulnerable societies stand evermore on the precipice of climate calamity with every passing day. The consequences will be most acutely felt by young people.

Yet, in town halls and municipal council chambers around the world lively and constructive discussions are taking place on how to accelerate the shift to cleaner forms of energy while avoiding social and economic upheaval. Avoiding such upheaval is especially critical when some of the necessary actions threaten the power of business elites and governments (such as removing fossil fuel subsidies).

Contrary to overused tropes about a “disengaged youth”, these conversations are largely prompted by young people, especially those from the world’s developing regions, who represent 88% of the global youth. Concern for climate change is something we see in the actions and responses of Global Citizens.

Ahead of COP26, we invited individuals on our platform to share their experiences with climate change. The result was overwhelming. Madelena from Kenya spoke about the devastating effects of shifting weather patterns on her farming town. Elizabeth from Tanzania urged action to help her community better prepare for flash flooding. Tyabe from Pakistan warned about the increasing threat of water shortages in his city.

Together with others, their voices formed a rallying cry from the world’s youth — one that demanded action for the planet.

And yet, for too long, the voices of many of these citizen advocates have been ignored and misrepresented on the global stage by local elites, international leaders and even by advocates and activists in the Global North who too often centred their own perspectives when it came to organising and storytelling.

Central to one of the most common narratives we hear, often drowning out all the other stories, is the perception that action on climate change must be a zero-sum game. Too many feel it is a war in which there will inevitably be winners and losers. There are those, primarily in the Global North, who argue the whole world must all move at the same accelerated pace to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Implicit in such assertions is that the development needs, hopes, dreams and aspirations of billions of people in poorer communities is of secondary concern. In effect, these people say to others: “Yes, it is a shame you will not be able to lift people out of poverty in the same way we did, but at least we will keep the planet from burning.”

At the same time, there are some political leaders who cynically exploit such assertions as an excuse for little action and who don’t show up at the negotiating table. After all, it is said, why should they? They are not responsible for the present crisis, so why should the aspirations and needs of their people be relegated to the back seat?

Yet such winner-takes-all equations form just one narrative; one that implies young people should put their concerns in life on hold to tackle climate change. Unsurprisingly, this is out of touch with — and does not speak to nor reflect — the views and stories of many youth in developed and emerging countries.

Put simply: a climate narrative focused on limits to economic growth and future pessimism is fundamentally disconnected from their aspirations and values. Neither does it reflect the huge economic opportunities climate action presents, which many young people are among the biggest proponents of.

A global survey by research agency Glocalities in 2021 highlights how youth in developing regions have similar high concerns about climate change as those in developed regions. Sixty-four percent of youth from developing regions are strongly concerned about climate change. Yes, their worries about climate change go together with similarly high concerns about poverty, corruption, quality education, and gender equality. And they are twice more concerned about unemployment than they are about climate change.

Overall, the research from Glocalities highlights that contrary to the pessimistic presentation of climate action as a zero-sum economic game by many of their leaders, young people in developing regions tend to be much more positive about their future. Bringing to the fore narratives and stories that speak to this alternative outlook could provide a way to finally move beyond the predominantly polarising tone of the so-called climate wars. It would serve as a catalyst for connecting to and mobilising, in huge numbers, a new generation of climate advocates capable of demonstrating to leaders the existence of an overwhelming pro-climate constituency impatient for change.

Core to this alternative narrative is that climate action can only be concerned with both the welfare of our planet and the future of our children; the two are not mutually exclusive. The solution to the climate crisis will undoubtedly create new opportunities to improve the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of one’s community, creating new jobs and economic opportunities, transforming and improving cities, clean air, supporting families and ultimately raising living standards using new technologies.

Data backs these opportunities up. Renewable energy currently creates five times more jobs than fossil fuels. And, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the number of renewable energy jobs grew from 1.7 million in 2004, to 10.3 million in 2017, and 11.5 million in 2019. So-called just energy transition deals are already being set up to enable particular willing countries to shore up the finance needed to do the jump while protecting their peoples’ welfare. It is happening in South Africa and this example should be replicated many times more.

Viewed in this vein, action on climate change is an integral part of the broader programme of societal and economic change, transition and transformation that young people are hoping their leaders deliver on. It is an enabler, not just to avoid climate disaster, but to fastrack ending poverty altogether. This is the story that needs to be told, indeed is being told and needs to be amplified to a wider audience.

It is a sentiment that was eloquently put forth by Brianna Fruean, a young Pioneering Climate campaigner from Samoa and a recipient of the 2022 Global Citizen Prize: Citizen Award. Receiving her prize last month at the Global Prize dinner in New York, Brianna shared her optimistic view that the climate crisis need not be the end, but the beginning, in her words, “of an environmental renaissance that serves as a refresh for humanity”. A refresh that consists of transformative action that brings together everyone: from those communities on the frontlines, to those workers affected in the great energy transition to come.

There are plenty more stories like Brianna’s already being told as a counterpoint to the prevailing pessimistic and antagonistic narratives that tend to dominate global climate discussions. But they need a larger stage to cut through at COP27 in Egypt, G20 in Bali, G7 in Germany and equally important, at home. A citizens conference on global governance that creates space for these stories to be told and disseminated among the highest levels could definitely help.

In the end, the surfacing and promotion of alternative narratives and stories on climate action may not only provide the basis for energising new constituencies and movements of climate advocates in communities around the world. It would also prevent the cynical appropriation of young peoples’ aspirations as an excuse for inaction on climate change by putting to bed the myth they do not care. And, provided they can be forced to listen to new stories, leaders might finally recognise that they do have a cross-border mandate to move beyond the climate wars of the past, and take urgent action now.

A Global Sustainability Program: Lessons from the Marshall Plan for addressing climate change,"Introduction

Economies stagnating. Governments overindebted. The ashes of war impeding progress on international cooperation. A widespread sense of malaise and absence of urgency blocking the mobilization of capital.

Such a narrative could easily describe much of the world in 2022. But it also describes Europe in 1947, a moment of societal doldrums that preceded an unexpected and dramatic shift in policy frames and public narratives, which ushered in a golden age of prosperity. The Marshall Plan played a crucial role back then, and its lessons can help inform a breakthrough Global Sustainability Program (GSP) today.

At the end of 1946, after a rapid post-World War II bounce, European economies started to stagnate at levels of output below those prevailing in 1938.1 Agricultural output fell by 3 percent in 1947, and industrial output in the third quarter of 1948 was no higher than at the end of 1946. People were hungry and cold; governments were overindebted and had exhausted much of their foreign exchange reserves; and countries were unable to trade with each other.

Like Europe after the war, sustainable development today seems stuck.

Against this backdrop, the Truman administration introduced a European Recovery Program, more commonly known as the Marshall Plan, to underpin U.S. national security by helping Europe recover.

Although there is disagreement as to the quantitative impact of the Marshall Plan, there is no doubt that it changed the European narrative. Eichengreen and Uzan (1992) describe the sentiment in 1947 as one of extreme pessimism caused by shortages of food, fuel, raw materials, and other supply bottlenecks, with governments unable to finance the repair of infrastructure, and businesses unable to access capital to buy raw materials or invest in new factories. Related Content Future Development Financing for sustainable development is clogged

After Secretary Marshall’s speech at Harvard University in June 1947, when he promised to support any European plan “to the extent practical for us,” the European governments quickly convened a Committee on European Economic Cooperation with a plan to mobilize $29 billion over four years to achieve specific objectives of restoring industrial and agricultural output, establishing stable macroeconomic and financial conditions, and stimulating trade. The U.S. Congress passed a European Recovery Program and appropriated a first installment of $4 billion in 1948.

The rest is history: A Golden Age of economic growth and prosperity in Europe (and the United States) and many other parts of the world that lasted until at least 1970.

Today, we again need to change the narrative, this time through a Global Sustainability Program. Like Europe after the war, sustainable development today seems stuck. People are lost. But there is an opportunity to move forward if: (i) a strong political commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Paris Agendas encourages everyone to align investments to meet these goals; (ii) there is a credible technical plan outlining details of specific projects, policies, and institutional reforms; (iii) finance can be made to flow effectively at scale to sound sustainable investments; and (iv) institutions can properly implement the plans and strategies. Dealing with these components individually will not work. There is a chicken-and-egg problem, or a causality dilemma. Projects do not get developed if there is no finance. Finance is not forthcoming if there are no projects. This is not unusual. It is a problem that can be solved through a critical mass of actions. The same was true at the time of the Marshall Plan, and there are lessons from that period that are relevant today.

There is a need for a massive scaling-up of investments to achieve economic growth and meet the SDG and climate targets.

All developing country governments face a major challenge of how to decarbonize economies, preserve nature, and simultaneously generate economic prosperity and sustainable development. The sentiment is gloomy thanks to debt, food, energy and conflict crises, natural disasters, and species extinction and a rapidly degrading natural environment. Trust in international cooperation is low after broken promises on climate finance pledges and limited assistance for COVID-19 response, including for funding vaccination programs. Many middle-income countries have been excluded from programs of international assistance. They are hesitant to join others in a green transition without addressing their other pressing priorities for jobs, education, and health care. Their strategies integrate and balance “economic development” and “climate-related” investments but global processes for these two streams remain separate.

There is a need for a massive scaling-up of investments to achieve economic growth and meet the SDG and climate targets. These would cost an incremental $1.3 trillion a year in developing countries by 2025.2 The system of long-term development finance falls well short of being able to support projects at such a scale. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged as much in recent remarks at the IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings in April 2022:

“Experts put the funding needs in the trillions, and we’ve so far been working in billions. The irony of the situation is that while the world has been awash in savings—so much so that real interest rates have been falling for several decades—we have not been able to find the capital needed for investments in education, health care, and infrastructure.”3

In this policy brief, I argue that advanced economies (AEs) and China need to put in place a major program of economic support for all developing countries to assist them to transition to a new sustainable development path.

Climate worries galvanize a new pro-nuclear movement in the U.S.,"Placeholder while article actions load

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. — Charles Komanoff was for decades an expert witness for groups working against nuclear plants, delivering blistering critiques so effective that he earned a spot at the podium when tens of thousands of protesters descended on Washington in 1979 over the Three Mile Island meltdown. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight Komanoff would go on to become an unrelenting adversary of Diablo Canyon, the hulking 37-year-old nuclear facility perched on a pristine stretch of California’s Central Coast that had been the focal point of anti-nuclear activism in America. But his last letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, in February, was one Komanoff never expected to write. He implored Newsom to scrap state plans to close the coastal plant.

“We’re going to have to give up some of our long-held beliefs if we are going to deal with climate,” Komanoff said in an interview. “I am still a solar and wind optimist. But I am a climate pessimist. The climate is losing.”

Komanoff’s conversion is emblematic of the rapidly shifting politics of nuclear energy. The long controversial power source is gaining backers amid worries that shutting U.S. plants, which emit almost no emissions, makes little sense as governments race to end their dependence on fossil fuels and the war in Ukraine heightens worries about energy security and costs. The momentum is driven in large part by longtime nuclear skeptics who remain unsettled by the technology but are now pushing to keep existing reactors running as they face increasingly alarming news about the climate.

The latest report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published in April, warned that the world is so dangerously behind on climate action that within a decade it could blow past the targets crucial to containing warming to a manageable level. Emissions analysts are increasingly critical of retirements of existing nuclear reactors as they take large amounts of low-emissions power off the grid, undermining the gains made as sources such as wind and solar come online.

The movement to keep plants open comes despite persistent worries about toxic waste and just a decade after the nuclear disaster at Japan’s Fukushima plant. It has been boosted by growing public acceptance of nuclear power and has nurtured an unlikely coalition of industry players, erstwhile anti-nukers, and legions of young grass-roots environmental activists more worried about climate change than nuclear accidents.

“I am part of a whole generation of people who became frightened of nuclear power, but I am also more willing to entertain nuclear than I once was because there is a climate crisis,” said John Parsons, an energy scholar at MIT and co-author of a report that urges California to postpone the closure of Diablo Canyon.

“When you want to go to net zero and there are hours of the day with no sun and weeks when the wind is not blowing, it becomes a much bigger task to ensure you have enough power,” Parsons said. “Nuclear becomes essential.”

California isn’t alone in taking another look at nuclear. Four states racing to meet their climate goals — New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Illinois — have recently shifted course on nuclear power, using clean energy subsidies once set aside for only wind and solar to keep plants open.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) tried to prevent the closure of the Palisades nuclear plant south of Grand Rapids, which powered the equivalent of 800,000 homes before shutting down on Friday. She called keeping the plant open a “top priority” of her administration in an April letter to the Energy Department that cited the state’s climate goals.

And Newsom shocked his state a few weeks ago by announcing that he is now open to extending the life of Diablo Canyon. He had helped broker the plan to close the plant by 2025, hailed as a milestone of the anti-nuclear movement.

California officials had long argued the state was different, full of potential to go carbon neutral without nuclear energy. But the state is reconsidering as it faces the risk of renewed blackouts and now stands out as a key test case for the new nuclear movement.

The Biden administration, which has encouraged California to reconsider Diablo Canyon’s closure in three years, announced last month billions of dollars in new federal subsidies designed to prolong the life of such nuclear operations. Days later, Newsom told the Los Angeles Times editorial board that he is now open to tearing up the meticulously negotiated closure plan.

Getting drawn back into this battle anew has longtime nuclear opponents exhausted. They are unimpressed by the MIT-Stanford proposal. The plan would expand the Diablo Canyon to include a plant making climate-friendly hydrogen fuel and a desalination operation pumping fresh water into the parched state. Nuclear opponents say it glosses over logistical, economic and public safety barriers that have already sealed Diablo Canyon’s fate.

“In the process of creating supposedly carbon-neutral energy, you’re producing the most toxic material ever created by humans,” said Linda Seeley, vice president of Mothers for Peace, a group that has been working to shut Diablo for decades. Seeley was among the 1,900 protesters arrested in 1981 during a days long blockade of Diablo Canyon by protesters.

“There’s definitely a climate argument,” said Rochelle Becker, executive director of the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility, a key broker of the shutdown plan. “But we have to look at the realities. We have gotten nowhere on solving the waste problem. … And how much are ratepayers willing to pay to limp this plant along?”

Indeed, on the sprawling campus of the Diablo Canyon plant are 58 concrete and steel casks housing nuclear waste, standing upright alongside one another like bowling pins. They are a monument to the federal government’s lack of a long-term plan for spent fuel, leaving it scattered among 80 currently operating and decommissioned plants in the United States. Plant opponents, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and Friends of the Earth, charge that Diablo Canyon is particularly dangerous because of the high potential for earthquakes in the area.

Yet rallying opposition is tougher than it once was. Nobody expects another blockade if Newsom and plant operator Pacific Gas & Electric move to keep it open.

Anti-nuclear sentiment is fading around the world as lofty goals for renewables confront supply chain disruptions, land use disputes and grid reliability concerns. California passed a law mandating that Diablo’s power be replaced entirely by renewable energy. But regulators are still struggling to draft a viable plan.

That has bolstered the case of climate activists like Brazilian model and social media influencer Isabelle Boemeke, whose avant-garde Tik Tok productions under the moniker “Isodope” espouse the virtues of nuclear power. The last sizable nuclear protest near Diablo Canyon was the one she organized in San Luis Obispo, where dozens of activists demanded the plant stay open.

“For young people, the bias against nuclear power is not so deeply rooted,” Boemeke said in an interview. “It is more a hangover from previous generations. They don’t have that strong emotional connection someone who grew up the ’70s has.” Boemeke sees nuclear waste in a very different light from boomers.

“For all the fears people have talked about for decades at this point, it just has not panned out that way,” she said. “It sounds scary, but it hasn’t turned out to be a huge problem.” It’s a talking point favored by the pro-nuke intellectuals at the Bay Area’s Breakthrough Institute, who note radiation exposure barely factored in the death toll in Fukushima.

Nuclear energy watchdogs call it misleading and dangerous propaganda. The number of individuals who developed chronic disease from exposure at Fukushima and Chernobyl, they say, may never be known. The World Health Organization concluded that radiation exposure from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster could ultimately lead to 4,000 deaths, even as the official death toll stands at fewer than 50.

The WHO painted a very different picture of Fukushima, where just one death is attributed to exposure. While hundreds died during the chaotic and traumatic evacuation, the agency concluded in 2015 that radiation was not the reason. It reported that the risk of future deaths linked to exposure during the accident is low.

Komanoff said he is still coming to terms with his personal repositioning after working to shut nuclear plants for decades, even if he is hardly alone. One of the nation’s most prominent climate activists, Bill McKibben, has similarly shifted his thinking on existing nuclear plants. And dozens of climate and energy scholars have signed on to a letter led by Obama-era energy secretaries Steven Chu and Ernest Moniz urging Newsom not to close Diablo Canyon.

“It was a big part of my identity,” Komanoff said of anti-nuclear activism. “If the pace of shoving fossil fuels off the grid and out of the economy were five times faster, I would not have spoken up.”

But the economic and safety arguments against nuclear power, he said, have diminished with technology improvements. “In 1985, every operating nuclear plant seemed like an accident waiting to happen,” said Komanoff, who is currently the director of the Carbon Tax Center in New York, a nonprofit group that advocates taxing greenhouse gas pollution. “That is just not tenable anymore. It has been 40-plus years without a serious malfunction in the U.S.”

He still opposes building new plants, arguing the economics make no sense. The one nuclear plant under construction in the United States right now, in Georgia, has become a cautionary tale of how quickly the projects can spiral over budget and behind schedule. The new reactors at Plant Vogtle Nuclear Power Plant near Waynesboro were supposed to cost $14 billion and start generating power in 2016. They are still not operational and won’t be this year. The price tag has swollen to $29.8 billion.

Yet some in the eclectic pro-nuclear-power coalition are pushing hard for more new reactors.

They include Michael Shellenberger, a media-savvy energy activist who is making nuclear power a focal point of a gubernatorial run against Newsom. He wants to see California add reactors at Diablo Canyon and build more massive plants along the coast. “Nuclear ought to be what was imagined in the 1960s,” Shellenberger said in an interview, “these highly modern, beautiful plants pioneering our energy transition.”

The Breakthrough Institute and others in Silicon Valley, meanwhile, are trying to nurture a new generation of reactors that are more versatile, efficient and safe, using sodium or helium as a coolant instead of water. The viability of that technology remains unclear, but the Biden administration and private investors are pouring considerable capital into it.

Some of the most effective evangelists in the new nuclear movement, though, are those who came to it from unexpected places.

When Heather Hoff graduated with a materials engineering degree from nearby California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, the plant was the obvious match for her skill set. Worries about radioactive fallout and environmental catastrophe left her doing everything she could to avoid working there, bouncing from a stint with a company making rectal thermometers for cows, to working in a vineyard, to a retail job.

Her uncle, a physics professor who had been involved in a local radiation monitoring program, warned her that working at the plant was a risk. Her mother also warned against a job at Diablo during Hoff’s reproductive years. Hoff finally rationalized when she took a job as a reactor operator at the plant that she could be a mole for the anti-nuke advocates.

“I was like, okay, I’ll go in and find out the real dirt and share it with them,” Hoff said.

The longer she worked at the plant — deluging her colleagues with questions about worst-case scenarios, examining safety procedures, studying the public health and environmental consequences from Fukushima — the more confident she grew that nuclear power had a role in solving the climate crisis. By 2016 she had a daughter and was moved to co-found a group called Mothers for Nuclear.

“I just have such strong feelings that this is the absolute right thing to do,” Hoff said at a local brewpub, where she arrived in an early-model electric car. “With the war in Ukraine and the energy situation in California, it is super obvious now. … We’ve made it safe to talk about that. What better way to make it safe than to have mothers saying, ‘nuclear is our future’?”

Labor Department urged to forgo retirement plans’ climate disclosures,"Both supporters and opponents of greater disclosure on climate-related financial risk are urging the Labor Department to complete its current agenda before pursuing additional rules to protect retirement savings and pensions from climate risk.

Despite differing rationales, parties in opposite camps are urging the department to avoid a scattershot approach that would overlap with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed climate risk disclosure rule.

Investors and organizations focused on environmental, social and governance issues say the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration should adopt a proposed rule expanding plan sponsors’ ability to consider climate risk and other ESG factors in their investments before the agency considers requirements to disclose more information on climate risk.

Once finalized, the rule, which was proposed in October 2021, would reverse the Trump administration’s changes in implementing the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a law that governs a broad range of retirement and health benefit plans.

That Biden rule would boost ESG options in retirement plans and restore advisers’ ability to utilize their shareholder rights. ESG proponents say the change is necessary to lay the groundwork for other rule-making the Labor Department might consider.",,[],[]
Jewish environmental thought is not ready for the climate crisis. But our tradition is.,"(JTA) — Smoke from California’s fires is regularly bad enough to tint the sun on the other side of the country. Pakistan and India just experienced a devastating heat wave. In the Middle East, temperatures have risen by 1.5 degrees Celsius, more than twice the global average.

Climate change, and its punishing effects, are here, and getting worse, yet Jewish thinking and advocacy on climate change are still stuck in prevention mode. The Jewish organizations that have blossomed to meet the political moment, not to mention the rabbis, activists and rank-and-file Jews who are engaged on this issue, are largely focused on one bottom line: Judaism demands that we care for the planet before it is too late.

This sentiment remains important and I support it, but it cannot be the only Jewish message for the moment. This is because “we” — the Jewish people — are likely powerless to affect the environment on a scale that would make a difference. It is also because, whether we like it or not, it is too late. As a scholar interested in the Jewish future and as a member of a research team devoted to Judaism and the natural world, I believe it is time to expand our understanding of what “Jewish environmental thought” can be.

The problems with mainstream Jewish approaches to addressing climate change, which scientists say is rapidly approaching a breaking point, are twofold.

First, unlike many other environmental problems, climate change can’t be meaningfully curtailed through individual behavior; for better or worse, it is primarily in the hands of national governments and the energy sectors that they regulate. In the United States, it is largely for the worse: Legislative deadlock and the current Supreme Court’s deregulatory impulses make it hard to imagine tighter regulations on emissions, and domestic political polarization severely hampers America’s ability to exert influence over the 85% of global emissions that are produced outside its borders. These realities undermine much Jewish thinking on climate change. Rabbis can tell their congregants that they should care for the planet until they’re blue in the face, but if their ideas are to be greeted with something other than a nod of agreement, a wistful sigh, and eventual indifference, they cannot solely focus on the possibility of political change.

Second, the “it’s too late” piece is harder to hear. Even if humanity radically changes its ways in the next decade, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it must, disasters aggravated by climate change are already here, and many people — especially young people — operate under the assumption that they will get worse. Despite this, messages from Jewish leaders largely continue to focus on prevention, frequently insinuating in the process that climate catastrophe is on us if we fail to act. Such messages were appropriate in the 1980s, when disaster merely loomed on the horizon. Now, however, this line of thinking will increasingly be heard as nothing more than a grand “I told you so.”

We can address both of these problems by expanding our conception of what Jewish environmental thought is supposed to be. Even as we continue to push for sensible climate policy, we must make realistic plans to greet the future, as well. Rather than doubling down on messages of prevention and personal responsibility, hoping to achieve a better result perhaps by being more emphatic about it, Jewish environmentalism must help people adapt to the stresses of our warmer world, offer consolation to those who are mourning the one that we are losing, and prevent us from treating the present climate as “normal” by reminding us of the truly normal climate that will soon be out of living memory.

The Jewish tradition is already well suited for these tasks. As examples: rabbinic Judaism’s central narrative about moral failure leading to the loss of a land bears a striking similarity to the contemporary climate crisis, and the long process by which all types of Judaism dealt with that tragedy speaks to its ability to reinvent itself around a story of loss and recovery, a story which has served it well through other periods of persecution. In terms of memorializing tragedy, Jewish tradition continues to commemorate events that took place more than two millennia ago, and the imperative to never forget continues to be highly motivating.

An expanded Jewish environmentalism also offers us the chance to reconsider a basic question: is this line of thinking for the benefit of the world, or just for other Jews? While politically minded environmental thought is strongly incentivized to spread universal messages, it does so by focusing on stories that Christians and Muslims will find relatable — Adam being charged with stewarding the world, Noah and the flood — and ignoring a much larger set of stories and ideas that are particular to Jewish tradition. The proposed new kinds of thinking might ironically be better capable of speaking specifically to Jewish interests, developing ideas about how to adapt to a changed planet that draw from the particulars of Jewish history.

Shifting Jewish environmental thought in this direction is not without its risks. As with any strategy that takes climate change to be inevitable, this line of thought could be accused of propagating a dangerous fatalism and sapping environmental activism of its energy. The risks are serious, but Jewish educators and leaders must understand that new ideas are crucial because environmental fatalism has already become the accepted wisdom. Many young people already assume that their entire lives will play out in a world of radical climatic decay, and this plays a powerful dampening effect in their ambitions to change even non-environmental aspects of the world. Jewish environmental thought, like the environment, is out of time. It is time to embrace this reality and think about the subject anew.

Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke breaks down findings from Cox Automotive’s Q2 Dealer Sentiment Index,"Cox Automotive recently released its Q2 Dealer Sentiment Index, which provides a current view of dealer sentiment and looks ahead to the next 90 days. The study reveals that COVID concerns are mostly in the past, but inflation, high costs, and low inventory continue to challenge dealers. Today on Inside Automotive, we’re pleased to welcome Jonathan Smoke, Chief Economist at Cox Automotive, to further discuss the Q2 Dealer Sentiment Index.

We all know there has been a lot of disruption in the auto market over the past several quarters. The overall sentiment of U.S. auto dealers in Q2 was good but declining, especially among independent dealers. The decline from the first to the second quarter was slightly more significant than usual for the season. There is seasonality to sentiment, and dealers are often the most positive at the beginning of the year and spring. However, the scores overall remained above the critical 50 threshold, meaning more dealers than not consider the market to be strong.

Dealers are amazingly resilient and seem to find ways to adapt to changing market conditions. Inventory remains the top issue amongst the dealer body when it comes to factors holding back business. However, dealers are very resourceful when it comes to sourcing inventory.

Another trend Smoke is watching closely is declining dealer views of credit conditions. The index findings didn’t show that it is a problem, but it is moving in the wrong direction. If this is the start of a negative trend, it could reveal more challenges down the road. Additionally, car dealers are less optimistic about the future than the current climate.

Business optimism improves in May 2022: Poll,"Credit: Cat Act Art/Shutterstock.com.

Business optimism increased in May 2022 compared to April 2022, amid concerns over rising costs, economic slowdown, and the Ukraine war, revealed analysis of an ongoing poll by Verdict.

Verdict has been conducting the poll to study the trends in business optimism during COVID-19 as reflected by the views of companies on their future growth prospects amid the pandemic.

Analysis of the poll responses recorded in May 2022 shows that optimism regarding future growth prospects increased by one percentage point to 58% from 57% in April 2022.

The respondents who were optimistic increased by two percentage points to 24% in May, while those very optimistic decreased to 34% from 35% in April.

The respondents who were pessimistic decreased by three percentage points to 10%, whereas those who were very pessimistic increased by two percentage points to 16% in May.

The percentage of respondents who were neutral (neither optimistic nor pessimistic) remained unchanged at 16%.

The analysis is based on 447 responses received from the readers of Verdict network sites between 01 May and 31 May 2022.

Businesses more optimistic in the UK despite the Ukraine-Russia conflict

Business confidence in the UK rose for the first time since February in May 2022, even amid concerns over the prolonged Ukraine war. Business confidence jumped five percentage points to 38%, the highest since February and ten points above the historic average of 28%, according to the Lloyds Bank Business Barometer.

The Barometer, however, revealed a weakening retail sector that dropped by two points to 27%, the lowest since March 2021 amid worries over tight household incomes despite fading COVID-19 concerns. Higher costs and economic slowdown have been the biggest concerns for UK businesses between February and May.

The Barometer also found employment intentions to have increased for the first time in three months, with 53% of the firms looking to expand their workforce. In addition, 57% of the firms expected higher prices for their products and services, thereby looking to rebuild their margins to beat the rising costs.

The ONS Business Insights and Conditions Survey further revealed that 20.4% of respondents in the UK believed that their businesses would do better in the next 12 months.

Business sentiment improves in other European nations

Business confidence climate rose from 108.4 to 110.9 in May in Italy, according to the Istat Economic Sentiment Indicator (IESI) index. The index indicated improved confidence in market services increasing from 97.2 in April to 103.6 in May. Confidence also rose in retail trade increasing from 103.6 to 105.5 owing to advances in business activity estimations.

The business sentiment in Ireland increased marginally by 0.8 points from the previous month, to 89.5, according to Bank of Ireland’s Economic Pulse, an index based on a series of surveys. Businesses, however, lowered their expectations for business activity due to inflationary environment and increase in cost pressures. Furthermore, 87% of businesses reported an increase in non-labour input costs.

The business climate sentiment improved in Germany in May with companies being satisfied with their current business, according to the ifo Business Climate Index, which rose from 91.9 points in April to 93 points in May. The index showed a marked improvement in the manufacturing sector to 2.8 points from -0.7 points in April.

Confidence improves in manufacturing sector

The business survey index (BSI) outlook for May 2022 revealed improved confidence in Korea’s manufacturing sector, which increased by three points to 88. Concerns over the prolonged Ukraine-Russia conflict and its resulting impact on supply chains is expected to dim investments, prevent exports recovery, and lead to high inflationary pressures. Consumption, however, is expected to rebound due to a recovery in employment and removal of COVID-19 safety protocols.

India’s manufacturing sector also witnessed steady growth despite historically high inflation, according to the S&P Global India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), which stood at 54.6 in May 2022, compared to 54.7 in April 2022. The May data further revealed a strong demand despite increase in selling prices. Businesses reported a significant increase in new orders, similar to the trend in April, while export orders grew at the strongest rate since April 2011.",,[],['Globaldata Report']

"Book review of Fire and Flood: A People's History of Climate Change, from 1979 to the Present by Eugene Linden and Klimat: Russia in the Age of Climate Change by Thane Gustafson","Placeholder while article actions load

Climatology is a Cold War science. It relies on expensive equipment and researchers spanning the globe taking measurements. In the 1950s, American and Soviet scientists led in recording the first signs of human-driven climate change. As a young researcher in 1960, Charles Keeling published data on the rise of carbon dioxide emissions from the top of Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano. In the early 1960s, Russian climatologist Mikhail Budyko linked the rise in carbon dioxide to humans burning fossil fuels. The Cold War powers, major producers of carbon dioxide, were in the position to lead on the issue. Instead, political leaders in both countries squandered decades of precious time by ignoring or denying the very science they pioneered. Science is slow, but that slow? What went wrong?

Eugene Linden’s “Fire and Flood: A People’s History of Climate Change, from 1979 to the Present” and Thane Gustafson’s “Klimat: Russia in the Age of Climate Change” explore the political and economic perspectives on climate change in the United States and the Soviet Union and Russia. Placing the two books side by side displays an arching concordance. The rival nations evolved on the climate front to share much in common, as foes often do. Both governments subsidize oil production to the tune of billions of dollars. Both countries fall on the shabby side in responding to climate change, all while vying with each other for shares of the world’s oil and gas markets. And both countries have forceful lobbies and lawmakers resistant to setting limits on emissions of greenhouse gases. Political sentiments line up, too. The Russian and American right agree that climate change is the “scam of the century,” an excuse by the left to bridle industry. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration infamously erased climate change from government websites. Vladimir Putin celebrated a warming climate as good for frosty Russia. Russians, he quipped, won’t have to spend so much on fur coats.

Fur costs aside, in “Klimat,” Gustafson points out that temperatures will increase in Russia more than in other parts of the globe and that 70 percent of Russian territory is permafrost, which is thawing at accelerating rates, leaving behind large craters of sunken earth, cracked buildings and crumbling bridges.

The biggest problem, however, for Russia is economic. In the past two decades, Russia has thrived on the export of fossil fuels. The Russian leadership has been having trouble recognizing that the days of pumping oil and gas will soon end. Putin remarked in 2019 on the coming decline of oil exports: “I simply don’t see any threats to us, they don’t exist.” Presently, Russia is using its gas and oil supply to wage war. In April, it shut off gas to Poland and Bulgaria in retaliation for aiding Ukraine.

The U.S. economy, similarly propped up by oil and gas revenue, is also in danger. The European Union is threatening to impose tariffs on countries that do not meet E.U. carbon emission standards as a way to level the playing field for those that are cutting emissions. That move would cut into U.S. and Russian business prospects, especially as both are late in developing renewables and in preparing for a net-zero future.

In fascinating detail, Linden’s “Fire and Flood” tours the American scientific and political landscape that first grasped the fact of climate change and then forgot about it. In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter had solar panels installed on the roof of the White House. A 1979 report commissioned by the Carter White House and led by MIT atmospheric scientist Jule Charney warned in respect to a warming globe that a “wait-and-see policy may mean waiting until it is too late.” Yet that’s exactly what happened.

Linden’s narrative swerves between scientists reluctant to spell out the problem in anything but the densest prose and lobbyists paying to make climate change science go away. Moneyed interests, especially the Koch brothers, derailed political leaders who broached the subject. These leaders were usually Democrats — from Carter to Bill Clinton to Barack Obama.

Even Al Gore, who was a vocal advocate for action on climate change, succumbed to the pressure. Running for president, he did not mention greenhouse gas emissions as he courted the Rust Belt and union vote on the campaign trail. Oil and coal presidents — Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Donald Trump — raised money easily and did well at the polls. We are just waking to the impact of climate change denial as an invisible yet powerful undercurrent guiding U.S. politics.

Linden is also critical of insurers who should have been keenly aware of the risks of the properties they were covering. He finds fault, too, with business leaders outside the fossil fuel industry who were taken in by economists who greatly underestimated the costs of climate change. Yale economist William Nordhaus calculated that with a three-degree Celsius rise in temperatures, America would only lose 1 percent of national income. We now know that the damage from such an increase would be incalculable: The country’s entire infrastructure would shut down. How did Nordhaus miscalculate so wildly? He assumed that because most of the U.S. economy occurs indoors, it was immune to the impact of climate change. For that faulty logic, he won a Nobel Prize in 2018.

During this period, uncontrolled greenhouse gases mounted. Once in the atmosphere, carbon takes centuries to dissipate. In many ways, Linden’s book reads as a requiem to the power of scientific research and pragmatic, political action.

Hindsight gives the historian 20/20 vision. Linden acknowledges that 50 years ago, scientists believed climates changed slowly over long periods. They speculated that permafrost would remain stable for hundreds of years and that sea levels would rise at a “stately pace.” Then they learned more, grasping from Paleolithic data that past climate shifts were violent and extremely rapid. With floods, fires and storms multiplying, Earth itself has refuted the claim of a long, slow pace of change.

In the last decade, most of the political players in the United States are no longer denying the effects of carbon dioxide buildup. That is good news. Twenty percent of U.S. power now comes from renewables — more than coal and nuclear. The United States is on track to meet the Paris climate agreement goals for 2025, thanks to the 20 percent drop in emissions during the coronavirus pandemic. The bad news is that the Paris targets will only slow warming. Under the Paris targets, the temperatures will increase to a disaster-making 2.7 to 3.7 degrees Celsius.

Linden points to the business ventures emerging to profit from disaster and the tendency to reassign climate risks to the poor and vulnerable. “Our society is so good at monetizing discontents (think MAGA hats) and finding profit opportunities that its very adaptability has become maladaptive. We are so gifted at finding the profit to harvest in every risk and at pushing off the day of reckoning that, as a society, we have lost the ability to recognize and adjust to true danger.”

The Russian government published its first climate change plan in 2020. It did so after realizing that investment money is flowing away from fossil fuels. Now that missiles are darkening the sky over Ukrainian cities, we learn that a significant consequence of Russian denial is panic. Russia has less than a decade left to profit on the export of its coal and oil. After that, customers will no longer be buying. Russia relies heavily on the export of grain, a commodity that in the climate change future will become more expensive as yields decline. Capturing the Ukrainian breadbasket would help maintain Russia’s oligarchs in yachts, art and London townhouses. In waging war on Ukraine, Putin miscalculated, believing that Europe’s reliance on Russian fossil fuels was unshakable. But he fights on anyway, shifting the target to Eastern Ukraine, home to wheat fields and some of the world’s largest nitrogen fertilizer factories. The war in Ukraine, arguably a large-scale climate war, points to the immediacy of climate change and its power to uproot, inflame, explode and violently reorganize human life on this planet.

Russia’s War Is the End of Climate Policy as We Know It,"In the decades following the end of the Cold War, global stability and easy access to energy led many of us to forget the degree to which abundant energy is existential for modern societies. Growing concern about climate change and the push for renewable fuels also led many to underestimate just how dependent societies still are on fossil fuels. But access to oil, gas, and coal still determines the fate of nations. Two decades of worrying about carbon-fueled catastrophes—and trillions of dollars spent globally on transitioning to renewable power—haven’t changed that basic existential fact.

Meanwhile, the headlong rush across Western Europe to replace Russian oil, gas, and coal with alternative sources of these fuels has made a mockery of the net-zero emissions pledges made by the major European economies just three months before the invasion at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. Instead, questions of energy security have returned with a vengeance as countries already struggling with energy shortages and price spikes now face a fossil fuel superpower gone rogue in Eastern Europe.

Four days after Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest assessment of the impacts of global warming. Leading media outlets did their best to pick out the most dire scenarios and findings from the report. But the outbreak of the first major European war since 1945 kept the report off the front page or, at the very least, below the fold. “ Climate Change Is Harming the Planet Faster Than We Can Adapt ” simply couldn’t compete with “ Putin Is Brandishing the Nuclear Option .”

In the decades following the end of the Cold War, global stability and easy access to energy led many of us to forget the degree to which abundant energy is existential for modern societies. Growing concern about climate change and the push for renewable fuels also led many to underestimate just how dependent societies still are on fossil fuels. But access to oil, gas, and coal still determines the fate of nations. Two decades of worrying about carbon-fueled catastrophes—and trillions of dollars spent globally on transitioning to renewable power—haven’t changed that basic existential fact.

Virtually overnight, the war in Ukraine has brought the post-Cold War era to a close, not just by ending Europe’s long era of peace, but by bringing basic questions of energy access back to the fore. A new era, marked by geopolitically driven energy insecurity and resource competition, is moving climate concerns down on the list of priorities. If there is a silver lining in any of this, it’s that a shift of focus back to energy security imperatives might not be the worst thing for the climate. Given the scant effect international climate efforts have had on emissions over the past three decades, a turn back toward energy realpolitik—and away from the utopian schemes that have come to define climate advocacy and policymaking worldwide—could actually accelerate the shift to a lower-carbon global economy in the coming decades.

The issue of climate change burst into the global debate just as the Cold War was coming to an end. As one existential threat seemingly receded, another came into view. For much of the international community, particularly the United Nations and its agencies, climate change also became much more than an environmental issue, offering an opportunity to reshape the post-Cold War order to be more equitable, multilateral, and politically integrated.

Nonetheless, when the framework for climate action emerged in the early 1990s, it built on the experience of the Cold War era. U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements became the model for global cooperation on climate change. Just as the superpowers had signed treaties to gradually draw down their nuclear weapons stocks, nations would commit to draw down their emissions. Yet the first major agreement to propose legally binding limits on emissions—the 1997 Kyoto Protocol—was dead from the moment the U.S. Senate unanimously rejected its terms, even before the negotiations had been finalized. Combine U.S. opposition with the understandable reluctance of energy-hungry, fast-developing nations such as China and India to even consider limiting emissions, and the inefficacy of international climate action was set.

Aspirational goals and nonbinding commitments became the currency of negotiations that lacked any real enforcement capability. Like other U.N. initiatives that emerged in the 1990s and early 2000s, such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Convention on Biological Diversity, the purpose was primarily to exhort and galvanize. Yearly U.N. climate conferences, amplified by the world’s media, became performative theater where the utopian agendas of the global environmental movement—limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, powering the world entirely with renewable energy, switching to organic agriculture, and transferring hundreds of billions of dollars from rich countries to poor ones for mitigation and adaptation—could be talked about as if they were realistic.

Facts on the ground told a different story. The carbon intensity of the global energy system fell faster in the 30 years before the first major U.N. climate conference than after it—a result of rising energy efficiency, the spread of nuclear power, and the changing composition of the global economy. After 1997, when the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, both total and per capita emissions rose faster than before.

The capacity to adapt to rising temperatures and extreme weather events rose significantly as well—as evidenced by the continued decline in weather-related deaths. But this was not due to any U.N.-led efforts to fund climate adaptation, which never materialized. What made people all over the world more resilient to climate extremes was better infrastructure and safer housing—the product of economic growth powered by cheap fossil fuels.

The geopolitical, technological, and economic competition that characterized the Cold War had more success in reducing the carbon intensity of the global economy than climate policy efforts have had since. Emissions-free nuclear energy started as a spinoff of the arms race—a demonstration of technological prowess and the peaceful potential of the atom. The 1973 Arab oil embargo, an outgrowth of the superpower proxy war between Israel and the Arab world, sparked two decades of spectacular improvements in energy efficiency, the shift of power generation and heating away from oil, and the rapid build-out of nuclear power. The nuclear champions include France, which today remains the greenest of the G-7 industrial economies by a significant margin. Photovoltaic solar panels were developed for the superpower space race; their commercialization began as part of the Carter administration’s push for energy independence. Radical improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency come from that era as well.

Globally, the share of electricity from clean sources—nuclear, hydropower, and renewable energy—peaked in 1993, just after the Cold War ended. Hopes that the world would turn from brinkmanship to cooperation on the shared goal of reducing emissions proved illusory. Instead, peace, prosperity, and access to plentiful cheap energy in the post-Cold War era dramatically lowered national incentives to make major investments in energy security. In an integrated global economy free of major conflict, the world could run on Russian gas, Middle East oil, and, more recently, Chinese solar panels.

That world ended on Feb. 24.

Much of the climate commentariat—politicians and policymakers, academics and think tank analysts, journalists and activists—appears shellshocked by the violent return of energy geopolitics and fossil fuel shortages. For many, the war has simply provided another opportunity to inveigh against fossil fuels and promote renewable energy. Ukraine and the world, environmentalist Bill McKibben argued in a long New Yorker essay, are burning because we keep burning things. A switch to solar and wind energy and electric vehicles, McKibben asserted, would free us from dependence on dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin—a common refrain of the latest climate discourse. What McKibben neglected to mention is that most of the world’s solar panel and battery production is controlled by another dictator—Chinese President Xi Jinping—and that Europe’s headlong rush to shut down fossil fuel production and shift to renewable energy over the last decade substantially increased its dependence on Russian oil and gas.

The facile solutions offered by McKibben and other environmentalists fail to reckon with many things, not least how profoundly the world has changed since Russia’s invasion. Europe’s heavy dependency on Russian oil and gas is just the tip of the iceberg. The world’s renewable energy economy is deeply entangled with geopolitically problematic supply chains. Huge parts of the world’s supplies of silicon, lithium, and rare-earth minerals rely on China, where solar panels are produced by Uyghur slave labor in concentration camps. The idea that the crisis might be resolved by choosing Western dependence on Chinese solar panels and batteries over Western dependence on Russian oil and gas reveals just how unserious the environmental movement’s pretensions to justice, human rights, and democracy really are.

At a moment when democracy and liberalism are once again under threat, questions of energy security can no longer be separated from the question of whom we are doing business with. With Russia and China seeking to delegitimize liberal democratic norms more broadly both at home and abroad—including by waging wars of conquest—energy geopolitics cannot be understood outside broader conflicts over the rules of the global order. Our energy choices will either help or hinder our ability to resist these authoritarian regimes.

With the onset of the Ukraine crisis, the new reality is already evident. Since Feb. 24, the Biden administration has reversed course on its efforts to slow or stop oil and gas production in the United States by restricting access to federal land. Instead, it is now threatening firms that fail to raise production with the cancellation and transfer of their drilling leases. It submitted budget requests to substantially scale up domestic uranium processing and enrichment, where Russia is a major supplier. And it invoked the Defense Production Act in an effort to raise domestic production of critical minerals now supplied by China. The focus is on the entire energy supply chain—fossil and nonfossil fuels, nuclear and renewable energy, supplies from China as well as Russia.

The same story is unfolding in Europe. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and his counterparts in the European Union, who have led efforts in recent years to choke off international finance for oil and gas development, have made a sudden about-face. The trans-Saharan gas pipeline, which would bring natural gas from Nigeria to Morocco and from there to European markets, is now back on the fast track after languishing due to opposition from European climate policymakers and lack of finance. Now that Europe needs African gas, it seems that Africans are finally deserving of the benefits of their own energy supplies too.

Eastern European countries like Poland, Romania, and the Czech Republic, long wary of relying on Russian gas and ridiculed as paranoid by Germany, are now moving forward with plans to source new nuclear technology from the United States. They might have sourced this technology from Germany had the country not sold its world-leading nuclear technology assets to Russia’s Rosatom during the Merkel administration.

In Asia as well, energy realpolitik has returned. South Korea, after flirting with de-emphasizing nuclear energy in recent years, has just announced plans to scale it up again due to growing concerns about rising fossil fuel prices and the high cost of transitioning to renewable energy. In Japan, for the first time since the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, a majority of the public now supports government plans to restart the nation’s reactors.







Energy policy in the wake of the Ukraine invasion is likely to be informed by energy security imperatives similar to those of the Cold War era. Nations will not be constrained by the ostensibly scientific targets that have informed climate policy in recent years but by the energy supplies they have available to them.

In response to the energy crises of the 1970s, the United States, rich in both fossil fuel resources and technological capabilities, invested in almost every energy source imaginable. It accelerated the development of coal deposits across the U.S. West, built rail links to bring coal to the Eastern Seaboard, and invested huge resources in the development of unconventional oil and gas production, including shale gas, oil shales, and coal-based synthetic fuels. It also made foundational investments in the commercialization of solar panels, wind turbines, and energy-efficient technologies ranging from LED lighting to combined-cycle gas turbines to fuel-injection engines.

France, Sweden, and Japan, almost entirely lacking fossil fuel endowments of their own, invested instead in huge build-outs of nuclear power. Britain initiated a dash for North Sea gas, which broke its dependence on coal and the deeply entrenched labor strife associated with it.

Whatever modest constraints that climate concerns have placed on fossil energy development are likely to be less salient in the face of supply shortages, price spikes, and other energy security concerns in the coming years. But continuing fossil energy development is likely to have only a modest near-term effect on carbon emissions. In part, that’s because there’s very little capacity to quickly ramp up oil and gas production across much of the world. Most of the low-cost, easily accessible oil and gas fields have already been developed, while new production is harder to reach and costlier to extract. Because existing wells naturally decline, any new production is unlikely to translate into significantly increased supply.

Constrained fossil fuel supply and the new energy security imperatives will likely be a boon for the development of nonfossil energy and infrastructure of all sorts. Long-standing green opposition to sensible licensing of new nuclear reactors in the United States, for instance, is far less defensible today than it was before the invasion of Ukraine. Similarly, it will be harder to sustain NIMBY opposition to things like offshore wind farms on the Atlantic seaboard or new long-distance power lines to bring wind energy from Germany’s stormy north to its populous south. Already, Germany and the European Union are leading a push to loosen environmental protections in order to accelerate approvals.

In every case, the post-Ukraine energy emergency is likely to accomplish much that the climate emergency could not. The environmental movement’s fetishizing of regulatory solutions and its arbitrary technology preferences have always hobbled its ability to advocate for effective climate policies at the scale needed to have much effect on warming. Ironically, decentering climate and centering energy security, particularly in the West, is likely to do far more to address climate change than the climate movement could ever have accomplished.

Climate change, though, is simply not going to be the main event. One of the less observed challenges as the United States and Europe have sought to mobilize the international community to isolate Russia politically and economically has been the lack of enthusiasm from China, India, and much of the developing world.

In part, that is pragmatic: Russia is a major supplier of food, fuel, fertilizer, armaments, and other key goods to many regions of the world. In part, it is because Russian-style corruption, illiberalism, and ethnonationalism are common, if not the rule, in many regions of the world. Putin’s war may not be their war. But many national leaders around the world are sympathetic to Putin’s broader rejection of the Western institutions and norms that have shaped the post-Cold War era.

But for some of these pro-Russian sympathies, U.S. and European leaders have their own inconsistent principles to blame. In the name of saving the world from climate change, Western leaders have exhorted developing nations to forgo the development of their oil and gas resources—and the economic growth enabled by access to fossil fuels. African and other developing-world governments rightly see this hypocrisy, given the heavy dependence of the industrial economies on fossil fuels. Even as Western countries such as Germany continued to build out their coal plants, they advocated for phaseouts of coal-fired power generation in poorer countries. Rich-nation governments have all but cut off most development finance for fossil fuel infrastrucure, despite continuing to exploit their own domestic sources.

Resentment runs deep. For decades, Western environmental and other NGOs, often with the tacit or direct support of governments and international development institutions, have broadly opposed large-scale energy and resource development, from dams to mines to oil and gas extraction.

The NGOs’ environmental and human rights concerns are often real. But the crusading and frequently patronizing nature of Western engagement with these issues, combined with the fact that the NGOs’ local campaigns against major energy projects are mainly financed, staffed, and organized by the West, has tapped into a deep reservoir of anti-Western sentiment going back to the colonial era.

In recent years, Western development assistance has prioritized factors such as transparency, civil society engagement, market liberalization, and climate change. All of this sounds proper and appropriate to Western ears. But the practical result has been the withdrawal of Western governments, development agencies, and financial institutions from virtually all large-scale infrastructure, energy development, and other resource-related projects across the developing world.

China and Russia, by contrast, have no such qualms and have leveraged investments in energy, resource extraction, and infrastructure to advance their geopolitical interests. Their intent is to create dependency in ways that advance Moscow’s and Beijing’s economic priorities while creating international leverage. Since the Ukraine invasion, the efficacy of this strategy is now plain for all to see.







How, then, should the United States and other liberal democracies balance their commitment to democratic and open societies, the imperative to disentangle their own energy economies from China and Russia, and their efforts to counterbalance Russian and Chinese resource diplomacy in the developing world? And how might they advance climate action in an era when other imperatives will almost certainly take precedence?

Doing so will require finding a new course for engaging with the world, rejecting both the preening moral hypocrisy that has characterized the West and the amoral agenda driving China and Russia. In much of the world, Western development institutions need to get back into the game of investing in the proven enablers of economic development: hard infrastructure and the development of energy and other resources.

Insofar as those investments have strings attached, they should support broader efforts toward democratization, transparency, and protection of minority rights rather than conditioning specific projects on a raft of demands associated with local environmental impacts or national action on climate change.

Liberal societies must seek to entangle their allies and suppliers in an ethical, rules-based, multilateral political and economic order while recognizing that democratization, economic development, and environmental progress are always incremental and iterative and that geopolitical competitors will happily step in wherever the West abandons the field. Choosing Western investment and technology must confer benefits in terms of access to markets and supply chains that allow emerging economies to hone some comparative advantage for key sectors of their economies while sidelining Russia and China.

Already, a shift in this direction is apparent. The scaled-back version of the trans-Pacific trade and investment agreement that U.S. President Joe Biden recently traveled to Asia to promote focuses on engaging Asian partners in a shared industrial policy that aims to downsize China’s dominant position in the renewable energy and battery sector.

The broader economy is also likely to enact significant discipline upon the utopian politics that have characterized so much of the post-Cold War response to climate change. A sustained decline in many financial assets—not least the collapse of many high-flying technology stocks and crypto assets—will deflate the endowments and investment accounts of the environmental philanthropies and billionaire donors bankrolling the climate movement. If nothing else, this will reduce the sheer quantity of climate discourse that has so distorted policymaking in recent years.

Inflation, energy shortages, and rising public deficits are also likely to bring an end to the easy money and expansionary fiscal policy of recent decades. The prospect that the generous subsidies driving the energy transition might be scaled back will put to the test claims that wind and solar energy can successfully compete with fossil fuels in many regions.

None of this is inconsistent with various policies to cut emissions and drive green development. But climate and energy policies, especially in the West, may shift significantly from subsidizing demand (for things like solar panels and electric vehicles) to deregulating supply (of things like nuclear power plants and high-voltage transmission lines). A shift of this sort—away from subsidizing specific green technologies favored by activists and lobbyists and toward enabling the broader technological, regulatory, and infrastructural basis for the energy transition—would put clean energy policies on much firmer economic footing. And it would better align climate objectives with energy security imperatives.

If recent months have demonstrated anything, it is that war, insecurity, and economic crisis are merciless teachers. Climate advocates and their political allies have often engaged in the policy equivalent of smoking one’s own supply: They have confused the subsidy-driven growth of renewable energy with evidence that the world is ready to rapidly transition off fossil fuels. Hence, they discouraged the production of oil and gas wherever they could and chronically underinvested in other sources of clean energy, such as nuclear power. But while there has been technological progress, the global economy is still very far away from fully replacing fossil fuels.

The confluence of war in Europe with a global energy security crisis reminds us that the West is not so different from the rest of the world. For better or worse, energy development and security remain the coin of the realm. Any global strategy to build a bulwark against ethnonationalist authoritarianism, achieve economic stability, and transition toward a low-carbon future will need to accommodate itself to that reality.",,[],"['Ted Nordhaus', 'Aaron David Miller', 'Ruairi Casey', 'Colm Quinn', 'Howard W.

Bill Gates Claim That Cryptocurrencies and NFTs Are Driven by Sentiments,"Bill Gates has denied any involvement with NFTs or crypto, claiming that he is skeptical of the hoopla. On Tuesday, the billionaire discussed digital assets at the Climate 2022 conference’s TechCrunch sessions.

Gates sarcastically ridiculed the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which have generated huge excitement and celebrity appeal, with different big names from various industries coming on board.

“Obviously, expensive digital images of monkeys are going to improve the world immensely.”

Bill Gates Claim That Cryptocurrencies and NFTs Are Driven by Sentiments 3

Bill Gates believes that crypto is based on a greater fool theory

Bill Gates resumed his discussion of cryptocurrencies and NFTs, stating that the market is driven solely by sentiment. “As an asset class, it’s built entirely on the bigger fool hypothesis, which states that someone will pay more for it than I do.”

The greater fool theory is a behavior in which people purchase assets with the expectation that someone else will pay more for them later. When purchasers are no longer prepared to pay a higher price for an asset, demand for the asset tumbles, leaving the holder with zero value.

Bill Gates has been a prominent critic of cryptocurrencies in general, claiming that it lacks genuine value at one point. The philanthropist believes that the value of cryptocurrency is defined by other people’s willingness to pay a particular amount. He claims that crypto is nothing more than user-generated hype.

Meanwhile, key cryptos are still moving in the red, indicating that the crypto market is on its way to slaughter. As the value of Ethereum has fallen, the floor pricing of NFTs has also fallen significantly.

According to CoinMarketCap, the NFT Index, which provides a summary of eight prominent NFT collections, is down 30% for the week. On Tuesday, BAYC NFT momentarily fell below $100,000, a level it hadn’t seen since August 2021.

"He quit Google to work on climate change. Now, he’s helping others do the same thing","Three years ago, while working as a software engineer at Google, Eugene Kirpichov happened to watch Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth on a long flight. On the flight back, he watched the sequel. Afterward, he couldn’t stop thinking about climate change. “Every time I would meet someone who was a real [climate] expert, I would ask them, ‘Is it really that bad?'” he says. “And they’d say, ‘Yeah, it’s really that bad.'”

The more he learned about the problem, the more anxiety and despair he felt. Then the pandemic hit, adding a new source of anxiety. But Kirpichov, now 34 years old, started volunteering on a project to build a low-cost ventilator, and it changed how he felt about COVID-19: He was focused on finding a solution rather than fear. He realized that he might have the same experience with climate. And even though he had a plum job in machine learning at Google—and had been there for seven and a half years—he decided to leave to find new work on climate solutions. Cassandra Xia, a friend at Google, decided to leave at the same time, as each convinced the other that it was the right choice. “The reason I’m leaving is because the scale, urgency, and tragedy of climate change are so immense that I can no longer justify to myself working on anything else, no matter how interesting or lucrative, until it’s fixed,” Kirpichov wrote in an email to colleagues. “I’d be lying if I didn’t say that I think others, who have the privilege of being able to do so, should follow suit. I like to frame the problem positively as ‘how much can we save,’ and every one of us can have a hand in saving something.” When he shared the email on LinkedIn, the response was overwhelming. “It turned out there were so many people in the same boat,” he says. Many, like Xia and Kirpichov, didn’t know exactly what direction to take as they switched jobs. So in July 2020, the pair decided to make a Slack workspace where anyone making the transition could talk. (They met their third cofounder, product designer Eva Illescas Sanchez, on LinkedIn.) “We just made this little experiment—let’s put everybody in a community and see what happens,” he says. “Two years later, we have the world’s largest climate community.” Kirpichov now spends all of his time running it.

The Slack community—called Work On Climate—now has more than 8,500 members. Many have backgrounds in tech or design, and even if they liked that work, they were all ready to do more. “[I’m] done with putting what time and energy I have towards anything else—this is our Hail Mary moment, and I cannot make myself be okay with working a standard job,” Briana Montagne, a UX designer and developer, recently posted in the community’s “introductions” channel. It’s a reflection of a broader sentiment: Nearly a third of Americans now say that climate change is their “top personal concern.” Among Gen Z, that jumps to 37%. While people often don’t know what to do—or feel paralyzed by the scale of the problem—the people in the Work On Climate community are ready to act. Some also are disillusioned with the current state of the tech world. “VC money, at least until recently, has been pouring into three or four areas—e-commerce, fintech, social media, and crypto/Web3—all of which have demonstrated, at best, minimal and, at worst, negative social value, and the people working for those companies know it, even if some of them (but by no means all) have done reasonably well financially,” says Jed, a software engineer who didn’t want to share his last name with Fast Company because his employer doesn’t yet know that he’s looking for a new job. (VC investment in climate tech is now quickly growing, with a record amount of funding entering the space last year.) Many people in the community are entrepreneurs and looking for potential cofounders or early employees. Richard Wurden, who had worked as an engineer at Tesla, met former software-company founder Kenny Lee on Slack last year; they now have a startup called Aigen, which is building small, lightweight solar-powered robots that can automatically weed farm fields without chemicals. The startup raised $4 million in seed funding in January.

For newcomers, the community offers “starter packs”—lists of resources about the overall challenge, specific topics like climate policy or carbon removal, and tips on the job search—along with curated events with speakers from climate-focused companies. Groups of people can also join learning groups to dive more deeply into topics. Some climate experts in the group volunteer as experts to offer advice to people just starting out. One channel in the Slack workspace lists climate gigs. In another, climate startups post full-time jobs. “From the start, we were just absolutely obsessive about keeping it actionable and motivating,” says Kirpichov. “For example, we really didn’t want it to turn into a place where people just exchange links, or sign petitions. We wanted to be focused 100% on helping people find climate work, and helping them take the next step.” There’s a perception, he says, that working in climate means being an activist or a scientist. But the constant stream of jobs posted on Slack illustrates the diversity: Engineers building carbon-capture equipment for cargo ships. Data scientists modeling carbon storage in trees. Software engineers working on wildfire prediction or clean energy. Analysts for an electric vehicle company or a climate tech VC fund. Someone working in a traditional tech job or another industry may not know these roles exist. “Even though the jobs are there, people don’t think of looking for them,” Kirpichov says.

“I used [Work On Climate] initially to learn about industries within the climate space that align with what I was looking for, something that has a broad environmental but also cultural and wildlife impact,” says Victoria de Aranzeta, who recently pivoted from healthcare to a job at NCX, a forest carbon marketplace. “Once I honed in on forestry, I started to cruise the jobs channel, to identify companies, research them, and seek out roles at the ones that resonated with me.” There’s an extra layer of complexity when someone evaluates a potential climate job, as candidates try to understand how much their next employer might actually be able to reduce emissions. “People are evaluating the impact that they’re having in a lot more detail than they would in any other purpose-driven space: Is this actually going to make any difference in the overall situation?” says Joshua Stehr, a service designer who has been volunteering to interview Work On Climate members to help the group learn how it can best support members. The community, which is a 501(c)3 nonprofit, is now fundraising so it can hire staff. While cofounder Xia took a job at a carbon finance company, Kirpichov plans to keep working on the nonprofit. The goal, he says, is not just to help people in the community transition to climate jobs, but also helping make climate jobs mainstream in general. Working on the problem has helped ease his anxiety. “I think these days I’m spending 0% of my time worrying about climate,” he says. “I spend 100% of my time just thinking about the next steps within the organization. It changed my outlook from the idea that capitalism and saving the planet are incompatible, to [recognize that] people who know how capitalism works are turning en masse to direct all their power, and connections, and skill, and industry knowledge to fix climate within what capitalism can do. And they’re succeeding.”",,[],"['About The Author', ""Adele Peters Is A Staff Writer At Fast Company Who Focuses On Solutions To Some Of The World'S Largest Problems"", 'Climate Change To Homelessness.

‘We Have to Make Peace with Nature’: UN Deputy Chief meets inspiring young climate leaders in Indonesia,"She was in the Indonesian capital ahead of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, taking place this week on the island of Bali.

But before discussing disaster risk reduction strategies with policymakers, humanitarians, and members of the private sector there, she heard from 15 youth leaders from across Indonesia, about the struggles they have faced, implementing climate-related projects in their own communities.

After listening to presentations on projects that ranged from founding digital food banks, to charting air pollution - and launching education courses on sustainable farming - the Deputy Secretary-General said she wanted to relay “the energy, the anger, the frustration, the optimism, and the hope,” of youth in Indonesia, during her meetings with delegates in Bali in the days ahead.

Tectonic plates

Bali is appropriate venue to host the Global Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction. Situation along the volatile Pacific Rim of Fire – where tectonic plates meet along a volcanic fault line - Indonesia recorded 3,034 natural disasters in 2021, according to the national disaster risk agency, which impacted 8.3 million people and caused at least 662 deaths.

Those figures will skyrocket if the world continues on its current trajectory of accelerated global warming towards 3.2 degrees above pre-industrial levels - more than double the 1.5 degrees limit scientists say is essential for avoiding the worst impacts of the climate crisis.

The IPCC’s latest report reaffirms that any rise above 1.5 degrees would lead to a dramatic increase in extreme weather events such as floods, which made up more than a third of all disasters in Indonesia last year.

But acting on climate change is not only a national imperative. In December 2021, Indonesia took up the Presidency of the G20, whose members account for 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Indonesia, a ‘well placed’ advocate

As the world’s largest archipelagic nation, Indonesia is “well placed to advocate for the interests of less developed countries and small islands states on the world stage,” says UN Resident Coordinator in Indonesia Valerie Julliand. “That includes holding rich countries to account for their commitment to mobilize $100 billion a year, to help poorer countries deal with climate change.”

Indonesian President Joko Widodo’s appearance at the COP26 climate change conference last year in Glasgow served as an example of how seriously Indonesia takes the issue.

Home to the world’s third largest area of forest after Brazil and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Indonesia pledged to halt or reverse deforestation by 2040 at the two-week climate summit in Glasgow. It also joined Member States in promising to “phase down” coal use.

However, Indonesia has not committed to ending its pipeline of coal generation projects under its current ten-year national development plan. The pipeline, which includes 13.8 GW of new coal capacity by 2029, more than 10GW of which is already under construction, is not compatible with Indonesia’s climate goals, environmental groups argue.

Besides being the world’s largest coal exporter, coal mining employs an estimated 450,000 Indonesians and supports millions more - mostly in economically impoverished areas of Kalimantan and Sumatra.

Helping Indonesia transition from coal to clean energy generation is the focus of the FIRE Dialogue partners, an international platform that brings together UN representatives, ambassadors and diplomats from multiple countries, and organizations such as the Asian Development Bank.

Optimistic for the future

“It is going to be difficult, but I am optimistic”, the Deputy Secretary-General told a UN in Indonesia Town Hall event, following a meeting with FIRE Dialogue partners on Monday. “We need concerted efforts to accompany this country in the next five years to really make that pivot towards renewable energy and a green and blue economy.”

She added that young people would be at the centre of this pivot, including through making sure critical facts are widely understood, among them, that the green and blue economy, can create three times as many jobs as those coming from the fossil fuel sector.

It was a sentiment that carried echoes of the conversations at the weekend with young climate leaders. After the 15 young activists presented the objects that helped sum up their inspiring work, the deputy UN chief shared some significant objects of her own, which she had brought along to the conversation.

These included a piece of sea glass, and a seashell, with a pale pink exterior.

The shell, she said, represented communication, and specifically, the need to get beyond the shell’s hard exterior to communicate a fundamental inner truth: “human beings picked a fight with nature. Nature fought back. And now we have to make peace with nature.”",,[],[]

"Fifty Years After the UN’s Stockholm Environment Conference, Leaders Struggle to Realize its Vision of ‘a Healthy Planet’","STOCKHOLM—Diplomats from countries around the world gathered here last week to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment—the meeting that made the environment a prominent international issue.

Last week’s two-day event was both a celebration of the principles germinated during the first Stockholm Conference and a marker of how far humanity has come, or in some cases, how far the world has yet to go to deliver on principles ranging from safeguarding ecosystems for future generations to environmentally sustainable economic and social development.

As expected, governments made no new binding commitments on climate change or environmental protection at last week’s meeting and the official outcome of the gathering is a document with ten recommendations for lawmakers with general tenets such as “placing human well-being at the center of a healthy planet and prosperity for all,” “recognizing and implementing the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment” and aligning “public and private financial flows with environmental, climate and sustainable development commitments.”

But the official proceedings were only part of the story of the Stockholm + 50 meeting. Like its namesake event, Stockholm + 50 attracted environmentalists, scientists, academics and other members of civil society to protest, hold their own events, network and lobby officials.

Hundreds of official side sessions took place on topics from “wellbeing economies,” the environmental rule of law, the human right to a healthy and sustainable environment and the rights of nature.

Outside the Stockholmsmässan center, unofficial events were held around the city before and during the official meeting. Greta Thunberg and her youth advocacy group Fridays for Future protested what they say has been bureaucrats’ inaction in addressing climate change.

And multiple events took place discussing the possible creation of a new international crime of “ecocide.” That term held particular significance: During the 1972 conference, then-prime minister of Sweden Olof Palme first used the word ecocide in reference to the United States military’s extensive bombing and use of Agent Orange to defoliate the jungles of Vietnam. Within the event center last week, meeting participants of all stripes could be seen wearing quarter-sized “Ecocide Law” pins—the term having evolved to describe all forms of widespread environmental destruction like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest.

Unlike the 1972 event, where side events were largely isolated from official proceedings, talks on ecocide, the rights of nature and other unconventional ideas attracted the attention and participation of officials from mainstream organizations like the International Monetary Fund, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and former and current government officials from various countries.

At the rights of nature meeting, the vice president of Bolivia, David Choquehuanca Céspedes, told an 80-person audience via video that the world should recognize the rights of Mother Earth, and that “the Earth feels, the Earth thinks, the Earth cries, the Earth feeds itself,” and is “a living being.”

After the two-day conference, U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Anderson told reporters that the meeting “got a lot of voices, we got a lot of newer ideas inside a U.N. forum…and I do believe that sooner or later, words that are bandied about, including ecocide, will walk its way into the United Nation’s vocabulary.”

Here’s a rundown of what was said about some of those ideas and how they’re making their way into the mainstream.

Ecocide

Environmental advocates have long derided what they deem “soft” international environmental law that allows governments to set their own targets on carbon emissions, biodiversity and the like.

Whatever the merits of that position, the non-governmental organization Stop Ecocide International has proposed another option: making ecocide a crime before the International Criminal Court alongside genocide and war crimes. Jojo Mehta, the co-founder and executive director of Stop Ecocide, said the crime is a missing piece of the global environmental governance puzzle and would deter decisions that lead to, or could lead to, mass ecological harm.

In the days leading up to the Stockholm + 50 conference, Stop Ecocide hosted a series of talks in the city about the proposed crime that featured lawmakers from Sweden, Finland and Iceland, as well as Indigenous leaders, economists, scientists and lawyers.

One of those speakers was Ralph Chami, a financial economist at the International Monetary Fund, who told live and virtual audiences that an ecocide crime would help restructure incentives for businesses and governments, effectively reorienting the relationship between development and the environment to one where humans are more likely to live within ecological boundaries.

Chami’s work has, in part, focused on how to monetarily value nature and the services it provides. In one case, he determined that the world’s current stock of great whales are worth more than $1 trillion, based on the carbon sequestration services they provide, their role in marine ecosystems and the global commercial whale-watching business. His financial valuation of “natural capital” gives governments and businesses a measurable way to value the services of nature and justify its protection, such as through legislation like an ecocide crime, Chami said.

At another event, Nnimmo Bassey, director of the ecological think-tank Health of Mother Earth Foundation, said an international ecocide crime would be a “key signpost” needed to guide humanity in “the right direction.” He won the 2010 Right Livelihood Award, which is often called the “alternative Nobel Prize.”

“The absence of a mechanism for holding humans and organizations responsible for massive destruction of Mother Earth has allowed things that are more or less unimaginable,” Bassey said, referring in part to oil drilling fields in the Niger Delta. “Having a law that would provide the necessary checks is what is needed today.”

The significance of the 50th anniversary of Palme’s invocation of ecocide catalyzed a new wave of support for the Stop Ecocide campaign. Faith leaders from around the world, Right Livelihood Laureates, youth advocates and participants in official “leadership” events at the conference all called for the adoption of an international ecocide crime.

Previously, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, Pope Francis have expressed support while the International Corporate Governance Network, a member-based group of investors responsible for management of $70 trillion of assets, called on governments to criminalize ecocide.

Many of those supporters say an ecocide crime would affect behavioral change because it places the freedom of individuals on the line: instead of companies, insurers, financiers and government officials receiving a fine or other sanctions for pollution, individuals within those organizations making decisions about what environmental risk to take would face personal accountability for those choices. That shift in liability would effectively force officials to take precautions when they act.

In the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, for instance, BP and other operators of the rig, among other penalties, paid upwards of $20 billion in civil and criminal settlements under the U.S. Clean Water Act, Migratory Birds Treaty Acts and Oil Pollution Act.

Although BP pleaded guilty to felony manslaughter, environmental crimes and obstruction of Congress, none of its representatives, including the wellsite leaders who the company said made decisions leading to the explosion that caused the spill, received jail time (though some were criminally prosecuted for a misdemeanor pollution charge and for obstructing justice).

The initial explosion killed 11 people, injured 17 and caused damage that spewed over 130 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, killing and sickening millions of birds and aquatic species like dolphins, sea turtles and whales.

In Stockholm, Björn Fondén, a climate change specialist at the U.N., condemned the way leaders have so far handled solving environmental problems, telling attendees at one of the official leadership events that world leaders’ approach to solving environmental problems is akin to the sinking of the Titanic.

“We have hit the iceberg. We have millions of people dying in the cold water as we speak because the rich refuse to share their lifeboats and continue drinking their champagne fully aware of the future awaiting the rest of us if they do not act right now,” he said, before calling on leaders to criminalize ecocide and end fossil fuel subsidies.

Discussions around ecocide took place against the backdrop of the Russian attack on Ukraine, which has renewed the world’s interest in international criminal law, its utility and purpose. The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity taking place in the country.

Speaking at another Stop Ecocide event, Tarja Halonen, former President of Finland, referred to Russia’s war in Ukraine in arguing that now is the time to strengthen international law, including adding ecocide to the short list of international crimes.

“The rules-based international order has brought immense prosperity and peace, which was not experienced before its creation,” she said. “I think that the respect of the rights of nature is a logical enlargement of this principle.…a new international law on ecocide is a solid idea to prevent serious, destructive actions.”

The Rights of Nature

A few doors down from where diplomats were gathered during the meeting’s three plenary sessions, a woman in a blue Sami dress opened a panel discussion on the rights of nature with a Joik, a traditional song of the Sami people who have historically occupied parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia.

The rights of nature, both a legal movement and a worldview, aims to give legal rights to elements of the natural world while transforming humankind’s perception of its place in the world.

The concept has roots in Indigenous value systems and has taken root in the legal systems of at least 11 countries around the world, including in many U.S. communities. While the rights of nature movement has evolved and grown over the past 15 years, the idea has been largely eschewed by international law and policymakers.

But, that seems to be changing.

Mainstream environmentalists and policymakers are far more aware of and open to the unique legal developments and the ideas behind them. The Stockholm + 50 panel on the rights of nature movement featured a former U.N. Assistant Secretary General, government officials, an Indigenous leader, an activist and a renowned environmental scientist and economist.

The collective sentiment among the panel was that existing laws and mindsets about the environment had failed to halt unsustainable harm to nature.

“Since the 1970s we’ve tripled the use of materials like fossil fuels, biomass and metals,” Anders Wiljkman, a former member of the European Parliament, told an audience of about 80 people. “If we continue business as usual, we’ll double that volume by 2060…We have to rethink the way we manage resources and nature.”

Patricia Gualinga, a leader of the Kichwa peoples of Sarayaku in southern Ecuador, said it is not enough for the rights of nature to be written into law, but that the world should adopt Indigenous communities’ values around nature: “It’s urgent that the world recognizes that nature is a living being like you like I are,” she said. “It’s a living being.”

In 2008 Ecuador enshrined the rights of nature into its constitution, but only recently began working on drafting legislation that would put the concept into practice—after the country’s Constitutional Court handed down a landmark ruling forcing the government’s hand.

By giving nature legal rights, as opposed to conventional environmental protection laws, the movement both raises the level of legal protection nature is afforded and casts the issue as a moral, as well as regulatory, imperative.

Part of that ethical shift is an unwinding of what Peter Doran, a law professor at Queen’s University Belfast, said is a colonial legacy exported by European countries that “translated nature into a series of objects for exchange of value in the economy.” Doran spoke about the groundswell of communities in support of the rights of nature in Ireland, a place that also was colonized, he said.

Like Chami’s argument that natural capital and an ecocide law can work together to place development decisions on a more sustainable path, Bruno Oberle, director-general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, championed tying together the rights of nature movement with a cap-and-trade system for nature at both the global and national levels.

​​“The root cause of this depletion is that we don’t value nature,” Oberle said. “We value it emotionally, we value it with words, but we don’t value it in economic terms. Nature doesn’t have a price and so we waste it, we overuse it and deplete it.”

An International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion

Among the thousands of participants packed into the event center was a smattering of young faces.

Some of those youth activists are part of a growing cohort of people from climate-vulnerable countries who are campaigning for the U.N.’s International Court of Justice to weigh in on climate change. Specifically, they want the court to clarify whether countries have a legal responsibility to prevent their greenhouse gas emissions from causing harm outside their borders.

To be successful, either a majority or two-thirds of the 193 U.N. countries (depending on how the U.N Charter is interpreted) would need to support a U.N. General Assembly resolution asking the court for a non-binding advisory opinion on the issue.

Samira Ben Ali, a 24-year-old from Mayotte (a French territory located off the southeastern coast of Africa), is one of the activists pushing for the advisory opinion. She and her colleague, 21-year-old Sophie Pecqueur, attended the Stockholm + 50 conference to build support for their cause.

Ali, wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the phrase “Taking the world’s biggest problem to the world’s highest court,” said 30 percent of her island’s tropical coral reefs are set to disappear within a few years and its land is threatened by sea-level rise, pollution and deforestation. She sees an advisory opinion as a way to spur national action on climate change.

“If an advisory opinion happens, national courts can look to the advisory opinion and base their rulings on it,” she said. “It could have a cascading effect.”

For Pecqueur, who lives in France, youth advocates are looking to the International Court of Justice out of frustration with what she said is the “blah, blah, blah,” of governmental negotiations.

“What officials are saying during the conference is true, we have to reduce our carbon emissions and stop damaging practices, but we can’t just say things we already know,” she said. “We need to take another step and go further.”

The questions that the youth campaign wants the court to answer—”What are the obligations of governments under international law to protect the rights of present and future generations against the adverse effects of climate change?” and “What are the responsibilities of governments to prevent their greenhouse gas emissions from causing harm outside their borders”—have roots in the 1972 Stockholm Convention’s resulting declaration.

That document enshrined the idea that humans have a “responsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations” and that governments have a “responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.”

So far, the youth advocates pushing for the advisory opinion have been joined by the government of Vanuatu and other Caribbean and South Pacific island nations, as well as some African countries.

The Human Right to a Healthy Environment

One idea first planted at the 1972 Stockholm Conference that has had considerable success in later legal developments is the notion that humans have a “fundamental right” to “an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being.”

The human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and versions of it, have steadily become adopted in about 150 countries (not including the United States). And last year, the U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a resolution recognizing the right. Now, advocates are fighting for the U.N. General Assembly to issue a resolution recognizing the right.

During an official side event at the Stockholm + 50 meeting focused on that right, David Boyd, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, told a live audience that recognition of the right has changed people’s lives by catalyzing initiatives that have brought clean drinking water and sanitation services to communities, blocked unwanted oil and gas projects and given communities access to information about environmental decision making.

“All social movements have used the power of human rights to achieve change in society,” Boyd said during the panel discussion.

Recognition of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is part of a widespread understanding that environmental degradation affects human dignity and rights, including the right to life and the rights of future generations. It is part of a reframing of the way humans have historically understood environmental issues, where environmental protection laws were relegated to the realm of policy decisions, separated out from human health and wellbeing. Today, classifying environmental protection as a “right” and connecting the effects of pollution to human health have elevated environmental protection into an ethical imperative.

Last year, the United Nations Human Rights Council created a new special rapporteur on human rights in the context of climate change. Courts around the world have issued landmark decisions holding governments and companies accountable for pollution under human rights law. And last month the Philippines’ Commission on Human Rights issued a report on the impact of climate change on Filipinos’ human rights, finding that the world’s largest fossil fuel companies had “engaged in willful obfuscation and obstruction to prevent meaningful climate action.”

The Legacy of the 1972 UN Stockholm Conference

In the lead up to the 1972 Stockholm Conference, the world had begun reckoning with a newfound understanding of humanity’s impact on the natural world. Rachel Carson’s 1962 book Silent Spring exposed the dangers of pesticides and other chemicals, the 1968 “Earth Rise” photo seemed to capture the planet’s fragility in a new light, and scientists were learning more about linkages between pollution and human harm.

Geopolitically, the world was in the heart of the cold war and on the back end of a wave of decolonization, leaving the global community split between industrialized countries and the developing world. Against that backdrop, 114 governments descended on Stockholm to confront growing global environmental problems and for the first time acknowledged the link between development and the environment.

The official output of the conference was a U.N. report that contained a declaration of 26 principles, or shared ideas, of the participating governments about how to tackle environmental problems while achieving economic prosperity. The principles have shaped lawmaking at the international and national levels, but the unofficial consequences of the conference are considered to be its most important legacy.

Governments, including the U.S., which showed strong support under then President Richard Nixon, created the U.N. Environment Program, which has helped coordinate global and regional action on environmental protection, spurred the development of new international laws like the ozone-protecting Montreal Protocol and helped create the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific body that provides governments with reports on climate change.

At the insistence of developing countries, UNEP was located in Nairobi, Kenya, giving the agency an on-the-ground view of issues facing those countries. The conference also had a catalytic effect on national environmental protection efforts, with about ten times as many new environmental protection agencies established within a decade of the conference.

Fifty years later, the world is in what the U.N. calls a “triple planetary” crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Last week, as governments took stock of the progress they have made, the frustration of other meeting attendees was palpable as they met over plant-based burgers and organic coffee.

Kamilia Kadzidlowska, a Polish mother who attended the meeting as part of the group Parents for Future Global, walked the halls of the event center feeling disappointed. Poland’s ambassador to Sweden had just delivered a speech that Kadzidlowska said falsely presented Poland as a country that wanted to tackle environmental problems but was now hamstrung from doing so by the war in Ukraine.

“Poland is the most polluted country in the E.U.,” Kadzidlowska said. “Just before the war started, the government and fossil fuel companies launched a campaign telling citizens that coal is great and we should burn it forever. This is how Poland wants to handle the triple planetary crisis.”",,[],"['Katie Surma', 'Grace Van Deelen', 'Dan Gearino', 'James Bruggers']"
It’s Now or Never for Congress to Pass a Climate Bill,"Climate hawks in Congress are gearing up for one more shot at passing bold climate-action legislation, and environmental groups say there’s no time to waste, since this legislative season could be Congress’s last best chance to address the climate crisis for years to come.

Late last year, Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat with ties to the coal industry, killed President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda when he announced his opposition to the sweeping climate and social safety net package. The bill, which had already passed the House of Representatives, would have invested more than $550 billion in renewable energy, electric vehicles, transmission, and clean energy manufacturing. It also would’ve imposed a fee on methane pollution from oil and gas operations.

Since Build Back Better’s demise, Congress has shifted its attention to other issues, including voting rights, inflation, and, more recently, the war in Ukraine and reproductive rights.

But in part spurred into action by Russia’s war, which has thrown global energy markets out of whack, Senator Manchin is once again willing to negotiate something—though the specifics seem to shift depending on his mood at any given moment. Characteristically, Manchin wants a lot more government help to boost oil and gas production as well as mining, while also smoothing the way for more pipeline construction.

The latest Manchin machinations include an attempt at a bipartisan deal, which would require votes from 10 Republicans to pass. The West Virginia senator has hosted multiple meetings with some key Democrats and some interested Republicans, including Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, and Mitt Romney of Utah.

Climate and environmental groups, however, see the talks as a distraction. And given the fast-approaching midterm elections, they also worry that the bipartisan effort may be a waste of time. “I think that there is not going to be any movement,” Sam Ricketts, a cofounder of the climate policy and advocacy group Evergreen Action, told Sierra. “And I think we will see that, no, there are not going to be 10 Republicans, nor really one or two, who are going to play ball on a bipartisan climate and energy package.”

Instead, climate advocates want the focus to shift to the Democrats-only reconciliation process, a parliamentary budgetary procedure that would allow the Democrats to pass climate investments with a simple majority of 50 votes, instead of the filibuster hurdle of 60 votes.

But the reconciliation strategy is largely on hold while Manchin explores talks with Republicans. The problem, as Ricketts points out, is that very few political observers see 10 Republicans signing on to anything that actually moves the needle on climate change. Even some of the GOP members participating in the talks do not seem keen to compromise. When asked if he could sign on to a deal that included subsidies for electric vehicles if the oil and gas industry also received incentives, Senator Cramer, an unwavering ally of the fossil fuel industry, said, “It’s a high, high price if we did everything that’s on the list. It seems impossible.” Some Republicans have even admitted that the bipartisan negotiations could be a ploy to delay action on the possible reconciliation package.

If and when the bipartisan talks stall out, “We are going to see the rubber band snap back quickly to the opportunity for reconciliation,” Ricketts said. “And I have obviously been eager to see that day arrive quickly.”

Others environmental advocates who know Capitol Hill well see the situation similarly. “I do think that there is strong sentiment to let those [bipartisan] talks run their course. That means that a Democratic-only reconciliation package is not chugging along,” said Melinda Pierce, legislative director for the Sierra Club. But, she added, “I'm not too alarmed about that because so much of the hard work has already been done.”

She pointed to the $320 billion clean energy tax credits contained in the now-defunct Build Back Better Act, which have already passed in the House of Representatives. Those provisions are essentially ready to go. As a result, it won’t be difficult to put a legislative package together in short order. “I think there can be a swift pivot to reconciliation,” Pierce said. “It’s really sort of a hard decision that needs to be made by 50 senators about what’s in and what’s left on the cutting-room floor.”

The bipartisan talks are a “distraction” from reconciliation, Pierce said, but “it could be that the bread crumbs of these conversations is what is leading us to final negotiations and the only path forward, which is reconciliation.”

When asked whether she is optimistic that Congress can get the job done, Pierce said, without hesitation, “Yes.”

Democratic members of Congress have been careful not to criticize the bipartisan negotiations too harshly, but they are clear that any deal with Republicans cannot result in sacrificing comprehensive climate policy.

“The goal of any major climate legislation has to be holding warming below 1.5-degrees Celsius, or returning to it after we overshoot. Mother Nature’s test is the only one that matters here,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island and one of the most passionate climate-action voices in the Capitol, said in a statement to Sierra. “The bipartisan effort and the reconciliation effort together have to meet that test. No one has proposed a bipartisan measure that even comes close, so it’s hard to see success without reconciliation also.”

The urgency from Senator Whitehouse and environmental groups is being fueled by the latest scientific findings showing that civilization is quickly running out of time to slash carbon pollution. Just this spring, scientists warned that there is a “brief and rapidly closing window to secure a livable future.” But most nations, including the United States, aren’t close to making the carbon pollution cuts needed to keep global temperatures in check.

“Between increasingly devastating climate-fueled extreme weather events, high gas prices, and rising inflation, we are out of time for the Senate to pass a transformational climate, jobs, and justice reconciliation bill that will save families money, create good paying jobs, and build a healthier, more just clean energy future,” Matthew Davis, senior director of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, said in statement to Sierra.

With midterm-election season beginning to heat up, Ricketts of Evergreen Action cited July 4 as a sort of unofficial deadline. The Democrats technically have until September 30 before the reconciliation process expires. But election campaigning and a long August recess likely mean the work needs to get done much sooner.

“The next few weeks are mission critical here, particularly in May and June,” he said.

If Congress fails yet again to pass climate legislation, there may not be another chance to do so for years. With expectations that Republicans could retake one or both chambers of Congress, it may not be until the second half of this decade before Democrats get another shot.

“The window could be closing. The stars are aligned. It’s now or never,” Pierce said.

Senator Whitehouse echoed that sentiment. “The coming months may be our final chance to get something big done on climate before the window to lead the planet to safety closes. I’m working very hard toward that goal, and I remain hopeful it can be done,” he said. “The stakes couldn’t be higher.”",,[],[]
‘It’s not all on you’: Billie Eilish appeals to Gen Z at her first-ever climate event,"Imperfect activism was the theme of Billie Eilish’s first climate event in London yesterday.

The 20-year-old singer-songwriter has made time on her Happier Than Ever world tour to co-organise Overheated, a six-day line-up of conversations with climate activists, musicians and designers at the O2. The venue has gone almost entirely vegan for the duration of the event.

She was undoubtedly the headliner for the young crowd, but took more of a backstage role.

“I’m so proud of my mum [Maggie Baird, activist and food charity founder, who played a key hosting role]. I'm so proud to be her daughter,” she said during a brief appearance.

It felt like the star wasn’t just saving her voice for the night’s show either, but stepping back to showcase an inspiring and diverse range of speakers. All were experts in their various fields of plant-based food, storytelling and sustainable fashion.

“I definitely suffer from climate anxiety and I know that so many people my age do too, and it’s overwhelming sometimes but I really just wonder if we’re doing enough.” Billie Eilish, Overheated documentary

Born into the climate emergency, Gen-Z does not need to be lectured on the impact of global warming. This was not an event, like COP26, where impassioned speeches are hurled at the shameless force fields of politicians and corporate heads.

Instead, for a little over five hours, the audience were gently included, invited and trusted as part of vital conversations. We were given a starter pack of concepts from what ‘plant-based’ really means to the definition of ‘decolonisation’, and tips on where to start with climate action.

Kenyan-American climate advocate and founder of Black Girl Environmentalist Wawa Gatheru set the energetic tone early on.

“Our generation, and every generation before, has never known a perfect world,” she said, “but we’ve never needed a guarantee to try and strive for one.”

From the creative fusion of Overheated - one of the best and definitely most youthful cultural-climate events I’ve been to - here are some thoughts and tips to (re)kindle your activism.

Why we need to unlearn perfectionism to be better environmentalists

“Being gentle in your heart and spirit can really go a long way,” says Isaias Hernandez, talking about the pathway to veganism. Don’t be tough and binary with your diet - especially early on, or if your living situation doesn’t allow you to be a healthy vegan. Climate-conscious changes like these involve unlearning perfectionism he says.

It’s a sentiment echoed by Samata Pattinson - CEO of Red Carpet Green Dress (RCGD) - during another fascinating discussion on fashion. She recounts the horrifying stats on the fashion industry - responsible for 20 per cent of global wastewater. But she hastens to add: “It’s not all on you!”

The pressure to buy something new, to keep up with trends and shy away from rewearing an occasion outfit is a relatable one, particularly for young women. Though it’s magnified on the red carpet, American actress Tati Gabrielle asks why this attitude can’t be reframed. It needs to be less about the garment and more “about the person wearing it, and how they’re using the clothes as a projection of self.”

Both Gabrielle and Eilish are known for their creative, DIY approach to clothing. While Eshita Kabra-Davies, founder of By Rotation clothing rental app, is doing her bit to open up our wardrobes and keep items in circulation for longer.

“It’s important that our tone is accessible and inclusive,” she says, “even to the person who still shops fast fashion.”

Again, baby steps are more valuable than unrealistic overnight change. Considering how many times you’re going to wear an item before you buy it (aim for 30 times minimum) is a good step, as well as checking the tag for materials. No matter how many times you wear something made of plastic, it’s never going to biodegrade.

‘I could never be Greta’

Alongside encouraging imperfect action, Overheated challenges our hero-worship of activists.

“I could never be Greta,” is something Force of Nature founder Clover Hogan hears a lot, and, she suggests, it’s far removed from Thunberg’s first simple protest.

“We’re all deeply imperfect,” agrees co-founder of the aptly named Bad Activist Collective Tori Tsui. She adds that change will come not from any one eco-influencer on a pedestal, but when all of us start acting together.

Dismantling individualism for community is crucial to this, though individuality is one of Tsui’s watchwords.

Towards the end of her interview with David Letterman - released on Netflix last month - the US TV host remarks that there have been one billion streams of one of Billie’s recent tracks; what he calls a ‘global number.’

'I’m so proud of my mum, I’m so proud to be her daughter,’ Billie told the audience. Euronews Green

“Those are people who are in need of having somebody, like you, take them through the mess that we’re living in, right? Do you ever think about that?” the host asks.

“Yeah, hell yeah,” Billie replies.

“You’re not going to outgrow those people? Will those people outgrow you?”

“Probably,” she says sagely, “everyone outgrows everything.” But you can’t help feeling - even if praising her misses the point - that Eilish is a star uniquely aware and well-adjusted to lead her millions of fans in the right direction at this critical moment.

“I hope you feel like you’ve found your squad,” her mother says to a cheering audience at the end of the day.",,[],"['Billie Eilish', 'Overheated Documentary']"
UK's energy crisis: Climate versus cost,"The UK is in the grip of a fierce cost-of-living crisis. In May, the country’s inflation rate hit a 40-year high of 9%, and although the current crisis is global, the UK has been particularly hard hit.

Skyrocketing energy prices are coalescing with a yawning supply-chain shortage and deepening food insecurity, all of which is intimately connected to the war in Ukraine and two years of pandemic insecurity, as well as Brexit and recent tax hikes.

As reported in the Guardian, the cost of basic goods and services for the average two-child family has risen by £400 ($695) a month, and two weeks ago a top energy boss warned that nearly 40% of UK households could face fuel poverty by October.

Amid this escalating situation, there have been calls for the scaling back of decarbonisation policies, to ease the burden of fuelling the nation.

But is climate-saving policy incompatible with an economic crisis? Or can climate mitigation go hand-in-hand with the alleviation of poverty?

And if the UK, often seen as a bastion of relative climate wisdom among more oil-dependent Western countries, sees its climate action eroded, what will that mean for the rest of the world?

“This may be a bigger risk if misinformation campaigns successfully fool consumers and policymakers into wrongly believing that the current crisis is caused by climate policies,” Bob Ward, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment

The UK’s climate policy as it stands is, at least in relative terms, an ambitious commitment to net zero by 2050. But the crisis has shifted Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s focus towards ramping up North Sea oil and gas production, a move intended to reduce energy reliance on Russia, even as he reaffirms his climate commitments.

In late May, the UK government announced a £15bn support package to cut household energy bills. The package will be part funded by a temporary levy on existing oil and gas firms, whose profits have soared thanks to the crisis. At the same time, however, the package also introduces a new investment allowance to encourage companies to conduct oil and gas extraction in the UK.

Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), says it’s too early to tell what material impact the current crisis will have on the UK’s climate-mitigation efforts. But he notes that the looming possibility of a recession “may lead the government and consumers to reduce investments required to accelerate action”.

Ward also believes the narrative may be co-opted by climate sceptics.

“This may be a bigger risk if misinformation campaigns successfully fool consumers and policymakers into wrongly believing that the current crisis is caused by climate policies,” he says.

Such machinations are already whirring away, from claims by Net Zero Watch (a campaign by a prominent UK climate-sceptic think tank), to former Brexit party leader Nigel Farage’s new ‘Power not Poverty’ campaign, which calls for a referendum on net zero.

In contrast, a 2022 analysis by CarbonBrief suggests the UK’s energy bills are actually nearly £2.5 billion higher than they would have been had certain climate policies not been scrapped by government over the past decade.

Analysts also point out that even as a quarter of the UK’s electricity is generated by renewables, fossil fuels (namely gas), which are the most expensive generator in the grid, are setting the price of energy.

Fergus Green is a lecturer in political theory and public policy at UCL, who specialises in climate policy. He says that while commentators are calling for expanded oil and gas exploration, such a move would have no immediate effect on energy prices.

“The fossil-fuel industry is using the current cost-of-living crisis to say what we need to do is explore more and drill more oil and gas,” he says. But “new oil and gas projects will take years to be up and running, so they’re not going to do anything to relieve the current crisis.

“What they will do is keep the economy wedded to oil and gas in the longer term, which we know is volatile.”

Sam Fankhauser, a professor of climate change economics at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, Oxford, UK, agrees.

“These things would take years to come on stream,” he says. “There is a real risk therefore that they would become stranded assets, i.e. they come on stream just as we get out of fossil fuels.”

As for ramping up extraction from existing assets?

“It’s fine to pump more oil and gas in the short-run from existing wells,” Fankhauser says. “But… the total carbon budget is fixed, so what we emit extra now will have to be saved later.

“The fossil-fuel industry is using the current cost-of-living crisis to say what we need to do is explore more and drill more oil and gas,” Fergus Green, UCL

“So, the implication is, we will have to accelerate the zero-carbon transition. Policymakers have to decide whether that is an attractive trade-off.”

The UK’s Climate Change Committee, the country’s independent statutory body on climate change, warned in a recent letter to Business Secretary Kwasi Karteng that increases in UK extraction of oil and gas would have, at most, a “marginal effect” on prices.

Many energy experts argue that a renewable economy, by contrast, would be more price-stable and cost-effective in the long term. Of the wind, solar and other renewables that came on stream globally in 2020, 62% were cheaper than fossil fuels, according to a report by IRENA.

And according to Sugandha Srivastav, also a research associate at the Smith School, renewable electricity is inherently more reliable, from an international point of view.

“While the fuel source for oil and gas is controlled by OPEC [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries], the ‘fuel’ for renewable energy is free, abundant and relatively predictable,” she says.

Ward adds that “production of oil and natural gas in the North Sea is declining, as it is a mature basin”.

“I think there are forces that will use the cost-of-living pressures to argue against the climate agenda,” Fergus Green, UCL

“The long-term clean-energy security solution is to push on with the net-zero agenda, and be serious about replacing all new cars with EVs, going renewable, pushing hydrogen,” says Fankhauser. “This will reduce our vulnerability to fossil-fuel price spikes and dependence on countries producing fossil fuels.”

But while building up the renewable economy should bolster energy security and climate efforts in the long-term, the immediate struggle is deeply real. So, can short-term policies alleviate the cost crisis and protect Britain’s climate commitments?

“The best way to help consumers and businesses that are suffering from rises in energy prices is to improve energy efficiency,” Ward points out.

“Energy-efficiency measures [like loft and wall insulation] can be implemented relatively swiftly and save money immediately,” adds Fankhauser. “Onshore wind has a decent pipeline that just awaits regulatory unblocking; electric vehicles are cleaner already with the current electricity-generation mix and as cheap to run.

“But they need upfront capital, so we need a financing solution.”

In fact, initiatives to improve housing insulation are a core part of the UK’s net-zero strategy – about 15% of the UK’s total emissions come from private homes, mostly from boilers burning gas for hot water and heating.

“The more we emit now, the more radical action will be needed later.” Mark Carney, United Nations

This is a key concern for Australia, too. Australia’s energy-efficiency ranking has dived over the last decade in comparison with other nations. It ranked 18th out of 25 nations in the 2022 ACEEE energy efficiency scorecard – the UK, by comparison, ranked 2nd.

And while the UK is one of the nations hardest hit by the energy crisis thus far, the same pressures are swelling around the world, including in Australia. On May 26, the Australian Energy Regulator lifted standard power prices by as much as 20% for some customers.

I ask Green whether he thinks the upswell of anti-net-zero sentiment spurred on by this crisis in the UK will be mirrored in other nations.

“I think there are forces that will use the cost-of-living pressures to argue against the climate agenda,” Green says. “But in places like Australia, the US, Canada, those forces are already very active.

“In the UK, those forces have been relatively quiet historically, but they’re mobilising now. So, I think this is going to grow in the UK from a relatively low base, whereas in other countries it might grow, but they’ve already had this sentiment.”

How a newly minted Australian Labor government will balance the cost-of-living squeeze with the climate mandate it has received remains to be seen. But in perhaps a foretaste of what’s to come, incoming energy minister Chris Bowen recently blamed the crisis, at least in part, on the outgoing government’s failure to bolster renewables in the system.

After nine years of energy policy chaos and rejection of the cheapest form of energy (renewables) the National Party thinks the answer to high prices is the most expensive form of energy..,nuclear.

In a speech at the Net Zero Delivery Summit in London in early May, the UN climate envoy and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney issued a stark warning against allowing the energy crisis to erode climate efforts. “We know the climate doesn’t care why emissions happen, only how much occur,” he said. “The more we emit now, the more radical action will be needed later.”",,[],['Amalyah Hart']
How facing your fears about the climate crisis is better for you and the planet,"Predicted increases in heat and flooding in our region and the news about extreme weather elsewhere — like drought and wildfires — can be a lot to process.

Add to that dire international climate reports and warnings that we have just a decade to make the changes to stop the most catastrophic climate impacts, and it’s no wonder that many of us are experiencing intense emotions around these issues.

Some have used the term “eco-anxiety.” It’s not a diagnosis, but more people are looking at these feelings to help people cope — like Britt Wray, Ph.D. She’s a broadcaster, author, and researcher, and her latest book is “Generation Dread: Finding Purpose in an Age of Climate Crisis.” The Allegheny Front’s Kara Holsopple recently spoke with Wray about it.

Listen to the interview:

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

Kara Holsopple: What’s your definition of eco-anxiety?

Britt Wray: I think of eco-anxiety as this storm of emotions. It’s not only a particular type of anxiety related to ecological degradation, that also includes feelings of sadness or grief or anger and general distress about what’s going on with the climate and wider ecological crisis.

These emotions can be constructive. They can be adaptive. They can point important things out to you about what’s under threat and cause you to make change in your life and band together with others to take action.

But because of their deep existential nature, when they make people feel truly unsafe in the world and fear the future in a very chronic way, they also can become disruptive to daily functioning, overwhelming, and therefore a huge impediment to mental health and well-being.

Kara Holsopple: How does eco or climate anxiety show up in people’s thinking and behavior.

Wray: In really diverse ways. It doesn’t show up at one severity level. There’s a scale that a climate-aware therapist Caroline Hickman has come up with that really charts this based on observations with thousands of people around the world who she’s helped as a therapist.

Let’s say at the mild level, if someone’s starting to get a whiff of eco-anxiety, they might feel uncomfortable in a grocery aisle surrounded by single-use, plastic-wrapped vegetables, and it becomes uncomfortable for them and they become kind of paralyzed with how to navigate that shopping experience.

But something that could be a bit more significant for someone would be, “Okay, I’ve had a significant wake up to the severity of the climate predicament. Maybe I don’t feel comfortable having children anymore and my partner wants to, and we’re in a huge conflict over that and maybe we’re going to split up.”

These kinds of relationship issues can become quite pronounced. If the feelings are really severe, a person may not be able to sleep anymore and not be able to concentrate, go to work, go to school, and unfortunately maybe even become suicidal and self-harming. So it really runs the gamut of all forms of manifestation of the distress.

Holsopple: I was interested in this idea of an internal-facing of our fears and emotions around the environmental crisis, and then that outward-facing of the problem by taking some action in the world to try to change things. Can you say a little bit more about the relationship between the two?

Wray: We are very used to a sense of urgency on the climate crisis. We’ve had that truth imprinted into us over decades of environmental and political campaigning on the issue. And it’s true. We do need external action in terms of our policies, our technologies, our innovations, and our science in a dramatic way. We need to be bold.

It’s just that we haven’t often recognized that there are internal skills and strategies that are just as important to an environmental struggle as there are these external actions.

At the same time, we have not often recognized that in order to shore ourselves up psychologically, mentally, and emotionally, to be able to do that work, which is hard and strenuous over the long term, essentially for the rest of our lives, because this crisis will be confronting with us over that time period and getting harder -– well, we can’t do that from a depleted internal state.

It is very much a neighborhood of burnout that many activists and green politicians and climate scientists and other people who are working on this problem full-time experience because of the mental exhaustion of knowing that we have solutions, and continuously seeing their importance disavowed and denied and not deployed by leaders who could otherwise do so.

That is just a process that taps people out and it leaves them essentially deflated and sometimes despairing, which then becomes easier as an individual to turn away. It’s just too painful.

But that can be resolved if work and attention [are] paid to the internal emotional resilience-building practices that are also available to us. To fill our cup up enough to be able to be resilient, connected, and grounded in a really deep way so that even as the going gets tough and tougher, we can stay in the work.

It’s just that we haven’t often recognized that there are internal skills and strategies that are just as important to an environmental struggle as there are these external actions.

We found that 45% of these young people around the world said that their feelings about the climate crisis are negatively impacting their daily functioning

But of course, many social justice activists have known this around legacies of colonization, slavery, and systemic racism. We can look at many different movements where predominantly people of color have been working to improve their situation and understanding that you need to be able to restore yourself internally to be able to take on the oppressions outside of you.

And while climate scientists have not been trained to think about that, it’s relevant here as well. Those are the kinds of arguments that the book makes in terms of turning inward to do whatever you need to do to integrate in a helpful way the anxiety and anger and grief that comes with confronting this crisis and bearing witness to more loss, and then being able to be externally strengthened and in relationship with others to push on the levers that we have to prevent more harm and save what we can.

Holsopple: I wanted to ask where privilege comes into this. Is eco-anxiety the manifestation of white, middle-class fears, while many people are already facing other existential threats, like systemic racism or other systems of oppression?

Wray: The data tells us that no, it actually is more pronounced for communities of color and often poor communities of color. So in one study that my colleagues and I did, we looked at 10,000 16 to 25-year-olds in ten countries around the world. We were trying to understand the scope and burden of their climate anxiety in places like India, the Philippines, and Nigeria, but also in the U.S., UK, France, and some other countries.

We found that 45% of these young people around the world said that their feelings about the climate crisis are negatively impacting their daily functioning -– eating and sleeping, working, concentrating, playing, and having fun, those types of things.

But in Nigeria, India, and the Philippines, for example, it was much more pronounced than the global average. It was around 67%, which is showing that these low and middle-income countries that have greater exposure to climate hazards already are being more disturbed in terms of just getting through normal tasks.

In the U.S., we have data from the Yale Program on Climate Communication that shows us that Black and Latino communities are more likely to be alarmed about the climate crisis than their white counterparts, and subjectively, also more willing to move into a position of power and agency and take some action on the topic because of their disproportionate exposure to the harms.

10,000 16 to 25-year-olds…75% said the future is frightening, 39% said that the climate crisis makes them hesitant to have their own kids, and 56% said humanity is doomed.”

So really it’s just an extra load of burden on top of marginalized communities. Why we tend to have this reaction that we think maybe it’s just a privileged preoccupation -– it’s just that it’s the first time that some privileged people are feeling destabilized in the world in terms of their own safety. So it’s the best way to describe their distress, but it’s not the best way to describe other communities’ distress where there might be more immediate threats.

Holsopple: Maybe not surprisingly, you write that climate anxiety affects kids the most. What can parents or teachers or the adults in their lives do to help them to cope?

Wray: It definitely does affect younger folks in a hugely outsized way. And one thing that makes this so hard is, going back to that study I mentioned of the 10,000 16 to 25-year-olds that we did, we found that not only was there disrupted daily functioning, 75% said the future is frightening, 39% said that the climate crisis makes them hesitant to have their own kids, and 56% said humanity is doomed.

Young people feel abandoned, belittled, and dismissed in their distress by older generations who aren’t stepping up to help them in this time.

Importantly, all of these sentiments were tightly correlated with the sense of being betrayed by governments and lied to by leaders, which introduces this important concept of institutional betrayal and the psychological harm that can come when people with less power require responses from people with more power in order to be protected and have their well-being upheld.

But when those with more power aren’t really leaning into that responsibility and doing right by it, this can create all kinds of negative emotional and mental health impacts on those who are dependent on them.

This is the widespread intergenerational problem that we’re dealing with on the climate crisis. Young people feel abandoned, belittled, and dismissed in their distress by older generations who aren’t stepping up to help them in this time, and instead are often saying things like, well, you know, when it gets really bad, I won’t be around.

This is maybe trying to use some gallows humor, but it actually ends up making the distress much more severe for young people because it’s a direct abandonment of something that is overwhelming, that they unfairly inherited along with the duty to clean it up.

They’re made aware of this before they can even vote and have any agency to act to change the structures that are stressing them. It’s just injustice all the way down, which means a site of serious repair would be stepping into solidarity, would be showing young people that you get it if we’re older, that we’re there for them, that we are not going to simply sit around on our couches and hope for a better future or rather offload our hope into young people who will save the day. But actually link arms with them, roll up, roll up our sleeves and use this amazing opportunity we have with this wild time in which we’re living to step into some purpose and support them.

If that institutional betrayal piece could be minimized by watching people within and outside of institutions come together on this issue, even as the world is burning, young people would be feeling much better. They would be less isolated, less alienated, and would know that people cared.

"Farm News & Views - June 14, 2022","The Gardner Food and Agricultural Policy Survey, is a collaboration between the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Economics, at the University of Illinois and Purdue University Department of Agricultural Economics. The quarterly survey asks approximately 1,000 US consumers questions about their opinions concerning how food and agricultural issues affect them. The recent 1st quarter survey indicated that most of the respondents believe that our food is safe, healthy, affordable and available. In response to a question about who they trusted most in the food system, respondents picked farmers first, grocery stores second, restaurants third, food manufacturers, and last, the government. However, consumers are worried about how climate change will affect the food supply by increasing the cost of food, how it might impact farmers and land available for food production and the possibility that climate change may cause food shortages.

Inflation is hitting consumers, with rapidly rising grocery prices that are up almost 12% in the past year, which is faster than the overall U.S. inflation rate of 8.6%, according to the government Consumer Price Index report. Food is the largest consumer expense after housing, amounting to 13.4 cents of the consumer dollar, and economists point out that food bills are an informal and frequent test of Americans’ sense of economic well-being.

Although ag commodity prices are at near record levels, the responses of farmers and residents of small rural communities to a couple of recent surveys indicate that there’s more than a little concern about where the ag economy is headed. The May Creighton University Rural Mainstreet Index for Colorado fell from March’s 86.6 to 76 in April, while the farm and ranch land-price index rose to 81.5 that’s up 5.3 points since March. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate that over the last 12 months, Colorado’s Rural Mainstreet has experienced a strong 6.6% gain in nonfarm employment compared to a lower 5.3% for urban areas of the state. The survey looks at the economy of communities with average populations of about 1,300 residents. Nationally, farmer optimism took a hit in May, according to the recently released Ag Economy Barometer from Purdue University and CME group. Farmer sentiment, an indicator of how secure farmers feel about the future of their operations and the direction that the ag economy is headed, plummeted to a reading of 99, the weakest farmer sentiment reading since April 2020. This report marks only the ninth time since 2015 that the measure of farmer sentiment has fallen below 100 points, according to Jim Mintert, director, Center for Commercial Agriculture, Purdue University. Mintert believes that the dramatic rise in production expenses concerns many farmers, and that’s the reason that farmer sentiment tumbled from April to May.

While these surveys indicate that many farmers are concerned that the ag economy is in trouble, some farmers and investors are obviously bullish on farmland. According to Randy Dickhut, senior vice president for Farmers National Company, prices for good quality cropland are up 20% in some areas since the beginning of the year. ""Good land that was selling for around $16,000 last fall sold for $19,000 to $21,500 per acre at company auctions in March,” Dickhut said.

Albert Einstiein said, “I never think about the future; it comes soon enough.

"Massachusetts climate change case against Exxon can proceed, court rules","A lawsuit by the state of Massachusetts accusing ExxonMobil of misleading the public about climate change can go forward, the state's highest court has ruled. Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court on Tuesday rejected a bid by ExxonMobil to dismiss the lawsuit.

The case, filed in 2019 by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey alleges Exxon launched an effort, ""reminiscent of the tobacco industry's long denial campaign about the dangerous effects of cigarettes,"" to deceive consumers and investors about climate change.

A lower court ruling previously rejected the company's argument that a state law shielded it from the lawsuit. The state's Supreme Judicial Court upheld that ruling on Tuesday.

A phone message seeking comment was left with Exxon, which has denied spreading disinformation about the contribution of fossil fuels to global warming. The company has previously called lawsuits attempting to hold it responsible for climate change disinformation ""baseless and without merit.""

""Greenwashing campaigns""



Lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies have proliferated in recent years as more research has emerged documenting theri role in casting doubt on climate-change science.

Research has overwhelmingly demonstrated that burning oil, gas and coal contributes to warming Earth's atmosphere and destabilizing the climate, with catastrophic results including increased flooding, extreme weather and more frequent heat waves.

When the research first became widely known in the 1980s and 90s, groups funded by the oil and gas industry worked to cast doubt on the role fossil fuels, and human activity generally, played in climate change. That's even though oil companies' internal research backed up the link between fossil-fuel emissions and global warming.

Now, more than two dozen cities and states are suing these companies over their role in clouding the science.

The Massachusetts lawsuit says Exxon engaged in a ""sophisticated, multi-million dollar campaign"" to sow doubt in climate science and downplay the link between fossil fuels and climate change. The lawsuit says Exxon also undertook ""greenwashing campaigns"" in an effort to portray itself as environmentally responsible.

""Rather than honestly disclose and mitigate climate change risks, ExxonMobil's misrepresentations about and failures to disclose those risks have delayed the needed transition to clean energy around the world and make these existential climate-driven threats to the global economy more likely to occur,"" the complaint says.

Healey called the court's ruling a ""resounding victory"" in the state's efforts to ""stop Exxon from lying to investors and consumers.""

""Exxon's repeated attempts to stonewall our lawsuit have been baseless, and this effort was no different,"" she said in a statement. ""We look forward to proceeding with our case and having our day in court to show how Exxon is breaking the law and to put an end to the deception once and for all,"" she said in a statement.

""The reality and risks of climate change""



In a congressional hearing last year, Exxon's CEO, Darren Woods, told lawmakers that its public statements on climate ""are and have always been truthful"" and that Exxon has ""long acknowledged the reality and risks of climate change"" and ""devoted significant resources to addressing those risks.""

Lawyers for Exxon argued in court documents that the company's statements about climate change and energy policy were ""protected petitioning activity"" even if they were made to defend the company's reputation.

But the top court said the law Exxon claimed should protect the company in this case doesn't apply to government enforcement actions brought by the attorney general.

Consumer sentiment plunges to record low amid surging inflation,"San Francisco (CNN Business) Consumer sentiment slumped to a record low between May and June, according to preliminary survey data released by the University of Michigan on Friday.

The preliminary reading is comparable to the trough reached during the 1980 recession, wrote Joanne Hsu, director of the university's Surveys of Consumers. In May 1980, the sentiment reading hit 51.7, according to

The final reading for June will be published on June 24.

All components of the index fell, Hsu said, noting a 24% drop in the year-ahead outlook in business conditions and a 20% decline in consumers' assessments about their personal finances.

About 46% of consumers surveyed laid the blame on inflation, an increase from 38% in May, Hsu said.

""This share has only been exceeded once since 1981, during the Great Recession,"" she said. ""Overall, gas prices weighed heavily on consumers, which was no surprise given the 65-cent increase in national gas prices from last month.""

Half of consumers mentioned gas prices during the interviews, she said.

as well as broader economic volatility caused by a lingering pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Consumer sentiment levels have slumped in recent months amid persistent and nagging inflation as well as broader economic volatility caused by a lingering pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Pedestrians carry shopping bags in San Francisco, California, on Wednesday, June 1, 2022. US consumer sentiment has sunk to its lowest levels on record, according to preliminary data released Friday by the University of Michigan.

""Consumer spending has long defied the fluctuations in consumer sentiment,"" said Greg McBride, Bankrate's chief financial analyst. ""What we're likely to see this time isn't that consumers cut back on spending, it's just that they spend differently. This is an environment where necessities are chewing up more and more of a household's spendable dollars.""

How consumers react from here could help or hurt the Federal Reserve's efforts to rein in inflation, Kurt Rankin, PNC senior economist, wrote in a note.

""Consumers will either choose to continue spending despite higher prices, making the Fed's choices more difficult through the second half of this year, or to pull back spending in response to higher prices -- especially regarding everyday necessities,"" he said. ""A spending pullback would slow the economy more on the immediate horizon but could be the difference in shallowing the depth of any potential recession in 2023 by making the Fed's job a bit easier.""",,[],"['Alicia Wallace', 'Cnn Business']"
Foreign investors lukewarm about Latvia’s attractiveness,"Foreign investors give Latvia an average score when it comes to investment attractiveness, according to FICIL Sentiment Index 2021 organised by Foreign Investors’ Council in Latvia (FICIL) and Stockholm School of Economics in Riga.

In preparation for upcoming Saeima elections, this year’s study focused on accomplishments of the last four years. Investors gave Latvia a score of 2.9 points out of 5 when it comes to the country’s attractiveness for investments and policy-makers’ efforts to improve its investment climate.

Investors were the most positive about capital reforms of the financial sector, reforms in higher education system, the administrative territorial reform, as well as politicians’ accomplishments in reorganising the country’s tax policy, especially when it comes to zero interest rate for reinvested profits. Investors were negative in regards to failure to resolve problematic issues related to labour force, lack of efficiency of in the public sector, uncertainty when it comes to policy-makers’ decisions and a lack of strategy when it comes to accomplishing goals listed in EU Green Course.

«One of the main goals of FICIL Sentiment Index 2021 is evaluating the investment climate development progress in Latvia. Every year it serves as temperature measurement of sorts to determine topical problems and solutions. Since it is election year, our latest index is a road map for the next policy makers. It offers suggestions to help improve the business environment to help increase investment volumes in Latvia.

The latest index shows that investors welcome the finance sector’s reform and the initiated higher education reform,

which will, hopefully, bring about positive improvements in the long run. Entrepreneurs carefully follow the situation and how politicians deal with complicated problems related to shortage of labour force, energy price rise, implementation of EU Green Course and other issues, resolving which will require close cooperation with the public sector. Will politicians continue working in a state of crisis, looking for short-term solutions to different problems, or will they be able to implement a sustainable policy?» comments FICIL board chairperson Zlata Elksniņa-Zaščirinska.

Considering Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, entrepreneurs participating in the index were asked additional questions to see how the situation has changed their plans and vision for the future.

«Data indicates the war in Ukraine has not impacted entrepreneurs’ plans – while at the start of geopolitical tension some entrepreneurs did temporarily halt or reduce investments, now most plans are already underway in most cases. Among the biggest challenges in the context of Latvia’s investment climate is the growing inflation, energy independence, labour force availability and security. As for the priorities of the next Saeima and government, under current conditions investors mentioned energy independence, state security, labour force accessibility and skill improvement, as well as reorganisation of the public sector,» said FICIL Sentiment Index 2021 author, Prof. Arnis Sauka.

Foreign investors gave Latvia’s government a score of 2.2 out of 5 for its efforts in implementing Europe’s Green Course strategy. To improve the situation, it is necessary to adopt clearer plans and management style, more involvement from experts and society in general, as well as educate the public and private sector, set clear directions and made data-based decisions.

According to the index, 65% of respondents have plans to increase investments in the coming years, which is 3% less when compared to the year prior and 10% more when compared to 2018. 20% of respondents said they have no plans to increase investments and 15% said they have yet to decide on this, adding that it depends on multiple factors. When asked the same question after the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 83% of respondents said they have no plans to change their investment plans and 17% said their investment plans have been put on hold or reduced in scale.",,[],"['Http', 'Please Enter Your Name Here']"
How Active Fixed Income Can Navigate a Higher Rate Environment,"U.S. stocks rose while government bonds stabilized in early trading on Wednesday as Wall Street awaited the Federal Reserve’s announcement on interest rate hikes. Investors and analysts expect the U.S. central bank to announce a 75-basis-point rate hike on Wednesday at 2 PM Eastern time, which would be the largest since 1994.

“Economists expect the Fed will continue to raise rates throughout the year as it battles inflation,” CNBC reported. “Some analysts now forecast the central bank will announce another 0.75% increase in July, followed by two 0.5% hikes in September and November.”

Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a report on Tuesday that they expect 0.75% hikes at the central bank’s meetings both this week and in July, underscoring what they called a “need for speed” to curb inflation.

“A more accelerated Fed hiking cycle ultimately should help tame inflation pressures but will make it more difficult to thread the needle between lower inflation and a recession,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that they expect the U.S. economy to enter recession around mid-2023.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said that he wants to get interest rates “expeditiously” to a neutral level (which would be around 2.4%), then higher as needed. Raising rates in 75-basis-point increments would achieve that level by July.

If the Fed raises rates by 0.75%, it would follow announcements of a 0.25% rise in March and a 0.5% hike in May, the latter marking the sharpest increase since 2000.

With the Fed expected to announce its decision on rate hikes later today (as 10-year Treasury yields hit their highest level since 2011), active management can help steer the fixed income allocation ship rather than advisors having to do it themselves.

“Active bond fund managers can adjust to sentiment that the Fed will take more aggressive action and shift exposure to less rate-sensitive securities,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi. “In addition, once the Fed acts and offers forward guidance, these managers can respond in a timely manner, helping advisors navigate the bond market challenges.”

"Under threat from climate change, Berkeley’s family camps adapt to survive","GROVELAND — As the Caldor Fire roared toward Berkeley’s Echo Lake Camp last summer, Liza McNulty was furiously refreshing her phone, hoping for good news.

Like many parents, McNulty and her family had made carefree days at the city camp above the Lake Tahoe Basin one of their summer traditions. And she knew that if the camp burned, it wouldn’t just be a sentimental loss: McNulty had spent the past four years overseeing the $54.7 million project rebuilding Berkeley’s other Sierra Nevada retreat, Tuolumne Camp, which had been destroyed in the 2013 Rim Fire. After years of negotiations between the city, insurance companies and layers of federal, state and county bureaucracy, that project was finally nearing its end — the rebuilt Tuolumne Camp will welcome families back next month.

“If this burns down, we’re just starting over again,” she remembered thinking about Echo Lake Camp last August. “Can I do that? Do I have the bandwidth to do this again?”

The camp survived, thanks in large part to the work of Berkeley firefighters who had been sent to protect it. Still, the near-loss became the latest reminder that Berkeley’s beloved family camps — Tuolumne, Echo Lake and Cazadero — are becoming more vulnerable as Northern California’s climate changes.

Fire season is getting longer, with hotter summers and years of drought meaning blazes grow bigger and more destructive; even Cazadero, in the redwoods of Sonoma County’s coastal mountains, was threatened by a wildfire in 2020. We also face a future in which intense and destructive storms are more common, which could mean more landslides like the one that damaged a dormitory at Cazadero in 2017 and prompted a $3.2 million rebuild.

“Each area has its potential catastrophe that we’re prepping for,” Berkeley parks director Scott Ferris said.

As those risks ratchet up, the city’s insurance coverage for its camps has been capped at just $5 million per incident, one-tenth of the payout Berkeley received for Tuolumne Camp.

But Ferris said he does not believe climate change will mean the end of the camps, which have been part of Berkeley’s civic fabric for a century. Instead, he and McNulty said the city and its camps are adapting: Tuolumne Camp has been rebuilt to stand a better chance of surviving the next wildfire, and the Berkeley Fire Department now deploys crews to camps to protect them when they come under threat.

“These are amazing facilities and they’re needed in so many ways by the community,” Ferris said, “so you just need to be more diligent.”

Camps became cherished institutions

In the early 20th century, many Americans looked at their urbanizing society and worried that city dwellers were losing their connection to the natural world, said Mara Melandry, an author who wrote a history of Berkeley’s family camps. Starting on the East Coast, cities and organizations like the YMCA established camps outside of urban areas — while the wealthy had their vacation homes, these camps sought to give middle- and working-class families, many of them immigrants, their own spaces in the great outdoors.

“They were definitely designed to have lower rates so that more ordinary people could enjoy them,” Melandry said.

The idea spread west through the 1910s, and Berkeley embraced it with particular fervor. The city founded Tuolumne Camp on U.S. Forest Service land just outside the entrance to Yosemite National Park in 1922. It had three camps before the decade was over, adding Echo Lake Camp and then Cazadero, envisioned as a closer option that wouldn’t require the long journey to the Sierra, Melandry said.

The goal of an egalitarian natural paradise wasn’t always fully realized. As Tuolumne Camp reopens, city officials are working to shake a reputation it developed as a retreat for wealthier residents, by expanding access to scholarships and ramping up outreach to make more people aware of its programs.

But for generations of families, the camps delivered on their promise of fostering a love for nature.

“It was the one place in the world where I was unconditionally happy,” said Phil Coffin, a member of the Friends of Berkeley Tuolumne Camp board of directors who attended as a child, worked there as a counselor and has written two books about it. Coffin has an image of Beaverhead Rock, the massive granite boulder from which campers jump into the South Fork of the Tuolumne River, tattooed on his left arm.

McNulty visited Tuolumne Camp for the first time in 2013, the same summer a bow hunter in a remote canyon of the Stanislaus National Forest kindled a fire that grew out of his control. The Rim Fire would eventually cover more than 250,000 acres, making it the third-largest fire to that point in California’s history; eight bigger blazes have ignited since then.

Before all of that, McNulty saw how free children were to roam without their parents’ supervision at Tuolumne Camp, and enjoyed the songs campers had for seemingly every task, from thanking kitchen staff to sending kids off to bed. Her daughter was 2, and McNulty was pregnant with her second child.

“We knew that we would come every year,” she said. “And then it burned down.”

‘It will be under threat again’

Standing on the road that winds past the newly rebuilt Tuolumne Camp, McNulty said it’s hard to overstate how much more protected the new facility is from wildfire.

As a result of modern building codes for areas with high fire risk, materials like the doors of the new staff cabins and the siding on the recreation hall are designed to withstand flames for longer than conventional construction. The new dining hall has a sprinkler system that covers not just the kitchen, 300-person indoor seating area and deck, but also the beams on the underside of the building to protect it from flames below.

Tent cabins, some of which were nearly touching at the old camp, are all at least 10 feet apart. The extra space means the camp’s footprint is twice as large, though its capacity of 330 participants and staff is unchanged.

Glinting on a nearby hillside, only partially concealed by the burned and still-standing trees surrounding Tuolumne Camp in every direction, is perhaps its most important new feature: A 240,000-gallon water tank, which firefighters can access from small yellow hydrants and connection points around the facility.

“The expectation is that it will be under threat of wildfire again,” McNulty said. “We want to be in a position where we can fight that fire and protect the camp.”

If firefighters can’t keep the next blaze out of the camp, she said, the higher building standards should mean “we are significantly less likely to have a total loss.”

The Rim Fire consumed the old dining hall, staff cabins, “Kiddie Camp” and every other structure on the site with the exception of 16 tent cabins and one bathroom.

Berkeley ultimately received just over $50 million from its insurers to rebuild Tuolumne Camp, along with about $1 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and California’s Office of Emergency Services, and $2.7 million of city funding.

That kind of payout won’t happen again: A year after the Rim Fire, insurer Lexington AIG enacted the $5 million coverage cap as part of an agreement to continue insuring Berkeley and other cities, Ferris said.

The city expects FEMA aid would cover losses that exceed the $5 million limit. Still, Ferris and McNulty describe the experience of losing Tuolumne Camp — and the painstaking process that went into its rebuilding — as a wake-up call that has spurred the city to better protect its camps.

The parks department has started showing Berkeley firefighters around Echo Lake and Cazadero, where they provide feedback on how to manage vegetation and mitigate threats, and also get familiar with terrain and structures they have been sent to defend in each of the last two fire seasons. A week before the Caldor Fire reached Echo Summit, Berkeley crews were at the camp clearing vegetation and preparing the site in case the fire became a threat; as the blaze grew and got closer, they returned to fight it.

“I have no doubt that we would’ve lost Echo Camp without our firefighters there,” McNulty said.

Fires change experience for campers

In the nine years Tuolumne Camp has been closed, camps like it throughout California have learned to grapple with a range of wildfire-related problems that go beyond the immediate threat of surviving a blaze.

“You typically don’t get through a season without some kind of smoke day,” said Jaye Phillips, park facilities supervisor for the city of San Jose, which operates its Family Camp at Yosemite a few miles from Tuolumne Camp. San Jose’s camp was spared serious damage in the Rim Fire, but Phillips said he and the other Sierra camp leaders are all facing similar challenges — like figuring out how to keep kids entertained during smoke days and deciding when air quality is bad enough to send participants home.

That’s one of many ways wildfires have changed people’s relationship with nature in places like the Sierra. In the Tuolumne Camp scene tattooed on Coffin’s arm, the river is surrounded by pine trees; the old camp could barely be seen from the road, sitting on a hillside thick with trees that towered over the dining hall.

“It was wonderful to be tucked away and folded in this rich, deep, green forest,” Coffin said. But in retrospect, he knows, that thick tree canopy he loved also made the camp more vulnerable to fire.

When the first round of families arrives on June 27, they’ll notice the new Tuolumne Camp is far more exposed. Volunteers have planted thousands of trees at the site, the species and their placement chosen with an eye toward future fire risk, but they’re still just saplings. Burned stumps are all that remains of many trees that used to provide shade and privacy around the camp.

“That’s going to be the most challenging thing for campers: feeling like it’s not in a forest any longer,” McNulty said. “Reforestation is the work of a generation, not the work of a construction contract.”

While the city sought to “harmonize” the new Tuolumne Camp with what people remember from the old one, McNulty acknowledges that the experience this summer will be different. The newly built tent cabins’ fresh lumber stands out next to the deep brown of the few structures that survived the fire, and it’ll take a while for the weathering steel on the roof of the new buildings to lose its shine.

But campers will still sing songs for every occasion, and the new showers have stone walls just like the old ones did. Staff will still put a weir into the South Fork of the Tuolumne River to make a swimming hole, and campers will jump off of Beaverhead Rock as a rite of passage. They’ll swim a few feet from the foundation of the old dining hall, its concrete tinted pink by the Rim Fire’s heat.

Nine years after she thought her Tuolumne Camp tradition was beginning, McNulty has signed her family up for their week this summer.

“I will be here every summer,” she said, “and I will be bringing my grandkids here.”

Asked if she worries that Tuolumne Camp might not be there for her grandchildren as the climate changes, McNulty said, “I feel concerned that all of the wild places in California are threatened.”

Then again, she added, “I think that this camp is probably one of the least-threatened that exists now, given that it is new and modern construction, meeting all of that fire-safe code. I guess the answer is sort of both.”",,[],"['Email', 'Twitter']"
‘Vicious cycle’: Storms intensify in the Gulf as climate changes,"Ecologically disastrous conditions in the Gulf are the latest sign of the dangers that climate change and other related factors pose to the Middle East.

In recent weeks, many in the Gulf have been looking up to an apocalyptic orange sky with a flurry of sand and dust storms (SDSs) battering the sub-region.

Construction of more dams, years of warfare, mismanagement of water, extreme dryness, desertification, and other factors all contribute to this nightmarish phenomenon.

In an increasingly climate-stressed planet, storms in these mostly desert countries, which exist in a dust belt, are set to intensify. What comes with these exacerbated ecological crises are increasingly dire threats to human health, economies, and security in the Gulf.

These transregional issues also have much potential to be a driver of future interstate conflicts across the greater Middle East.

Last month’s temporary closure of ports, airports, and schools in Iran, Iraq, and some Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states underscored the extent to which recent SDSs have taken a major toll on trade, travel, and daily life for the people of these countries.

Kuwait International Airport suspended all flights twice last month. On May 16, maritime operations in three Kuwaiti ports – Doha, Shuaiba, and Shuaikh – were suspended because of the climatic conditions. Sand and dust storms hit Riyadh and other parts of Saudi Arabia resulting in at least 1,200 people being hospitalised in the kingdom with breathing difficulties in May.

Dubai’s Burj Khalifa was not visible after a huge dust layer vanished the world’s tallest building.

In Tehran, authorities closed schools and government offices while there were dozens of flight delays or cancelations in western Iran. In Khuzestan, Iran’s hardest hit region, at least 800 people with breathing difficulties were forced to seek treatment.

Perhaps Iraq has been the country most vulnerable to sand and dust storms. Since March, there has been a storm hitting Iraq roughly every week, sending thousands of Iraqis to hospitals and the government declaring a national holiday to encourage residents and government workers to stay home. At facilities in certain parts of the country, Iraq’s health ministry even resorted to stockpiling oxygen canisters.

These ecologically disastrous conditions in the Gulf are merely the latest sign of the dangers that climate change and other related factors pose to the Middle East.

“In Gulf waters, SDSs are a main cause of sediments that can clog up nearby lakes and marshlands, and sometimes even cover large swathes of the Gulf waterway,” wrote Banafsheh Keynoush, a foreign affairs scholar and a fellow at the International Institute for Iranian Studies.

“Even renewable solar panels malfunction when covered by dust. Given these factors, it becomes evident that SDSs participate in a vicious cycle: Climate change causes the storms, and the storms exacerbate the impacts of climate change. Socio-economic life revolves around weather patterns, so livelihoods are severely threatened,” added Keynoush.

According to the World Bank, sand and dust storms in the Middle East come with an annual cost of $13bn. To be sure, such storms in the region constitute a transregional crisis. Mindful of the Middle East’s importance to the global economy from the standpoint of international trade via strategic waterways and energy supplies, countries far from the Gulf will pay a steeper price as the phenomenon exacerbates.

Opportunity for armed groups

Disturbingly, there is a growing threat of violence because of sand and dust storms. For years, the armed group ISIL (ISIS) in Iraq has exploited the lack of visibility resulting from these storms to carry out attacks with greater ease.

In May, ISIL carried out deadly attacks in Kirkuk and Diyala provinces, targeting farmers who were harvesting crops. In April, ISIL exploited the enormous storms to strike against the Iraqi army in al-Anbar province’s town of Hit, killing two soldiers.

Naturally, Iraq’s security forces will have difficulties coping with SDSs that leave them more exposed to future ISIL attacks. With this extreme weather requiring the military to put some of their operations and aerial support on hold, fighters will have an easier time exploiting these storms to wage more frequent attacks against the Iraqi military and civilians, particularly in more remote areas.

Beyond concerns about terrorism, experts warn these unusual storms have the potential to spur interstate conflicts in the region over water. Environmental crises related to low rainfall, drought, and declining river levels can serve to heighten tensions between countries.

Turkey’s damming of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is one factor leading to more desertification in Iraq, where water resources have fallen 50 percent since 2021, with a backflow from the Gulf into Iraq’s mainland.

“Saltwater is actually coming in from the sea into freshwater areas,” Tallha Abdulrazaq, an expert in Middle Eastern strategic and security affairs, told Al Jazeera. “This is killing arable land, causing salinisation of soil, and ultimately leading to desertification.”

Iran’s digging of canals around the Bahmanshir River, a tributary to the Shatt-al-Arab, “has artificially altered the midpoint Thalweg line in the Shatt al-Arab, which historically – and particularly since the Algiers Accords – has demarcated the boundary between Iran and Iraq across the Shatt-al-Arab”, explained Abdulrazaq.

“Basically, the water line has been split down the middle between the two. By artificially altering this border, this can lead to a conflict not only over the borders and access to the Shatt-al-Arab, but also to pollution of Iraq’s water supply.”

Desertification

The issue of Turkey’s dams is also adding tension to Ankara’s relationship with Tehran with Iranian officials partly attributing their country’s drought to Turkey’s upstream dam-building.

On May 12, a spokesman for Turkey’s foreign ministry dismissed such accusations as “far from scientific”, while maintaining that Tehran is not taking a “realistic approach” to this problem by putting blame on Ankara’s doorstep.

As the sand and dust storms terrify people in Iraq and other countries of the region, the serious effects of desertification are only set to intensify while global warming has the potential to make decreases in rainfall more permanent with a devastating effect on the ecology.

Among other factors, these terrifying environmental issues can be drivers of future conflicts in the Middle East.",,[],['Giorgio Cafiero']
"In West Virginia, the clean-energy transition rests on Joe Manchin","Placeholder while article actions load

KEYSER, W.Va. — About a three-hour drive from the nation’s capital, the road snakes past a barren brown landscape where lush forests once stood. The mountains here have been gouged by heavy machinery and stripped of sugar maples, yellow birches and other trees native to this stretch of Mineral County.

Mining for coal, the rock that gave the county its name, helped scar this landscape. But now a row of spinning windmills dots a nearby ridge, as a developer bets that mounting concerns about climate change and the coal industry’s viability will speed an energy shift here.

Renewable energy has just begun to gain a foothold in West Virginia, accounting for 6 percent of the state’s electricity in 2020 compared with coal plants’ 88 percent. Residents’ deep skepticism about the transition to clean energy — even among those working on the new Black Rock wind farm — has complicated President Biden’s push to wean America off fossil fuels.

No figure in the country has more influence over the president’s effort than Sen. Joe Manchin III, the powerful West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources panel. Manchin supports Clearway Energy Group’s Black Rock wind farm, which will increase the state’s wind energy generation by 15 percent. But he helped scuttle Biden’s signature climate and social spending plan last year, arguing the sweeping legislation to cut carbon emissions would hurt his constituents.

Chuck Parker, an operating engineer who helped build the Black Rock wind farm, shares Manchin’s doubts about a rapid shift to clean energy. He worries many coal industry workers who have sacrificed their health and well-being to power the state won’t find well-paying jobs installing wind turbines like he did.

“I don’t think wind is a replacement for coal,” Parker said in an interview at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the wind project in early May. “I think coal will always have a place in West Virginia, and it should. But wind is a great addition to our energy portfolio.”

Like Parker, Manchin recognizes the country’s inevitable embrace of clean-energy technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicles. But his continued opposition to sweeping climate measures stems, at least in part, from a fear of accelerating the transition at his home state’s expense, according to interviews with half a dozen people close to Manchin, including friends, lobbyists and West Virginia Democratic politicians.

“There are some on the left who believe people will suffer greatly if we don’t make this transition very, very quickly,” said one lobbyist, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve their relationship with the senator. “Manchin believes people will suffer very greatly if we make it too quickly.”

“This is a problem with the Democratic Party,” this person added. “They are perfectly willing to sacrifice men 45 to 65 years old, who are just never gonna retrain to work in [electric] battery plants.”

Manchin spokeswoman Sam Runyon declined to make the senator available for an interview for this story.

“Senator Manchin continues to work towards solutions that shore up American energy security and reliability in the near term by using our abundant natural resources in the cleanest way possible, while also investing in technologies that reduce emissions and lead the global fight for innovative solutions to climate change,” Runyon said in an email.

‘He’s fighting them’

Biden’s social spending bill, formally known as the Build Back Better plan, contains a record $555 billion package of tax credits, grants and other policies aimed at cutting planet-warming emissions and boosting clean energy. The legislation would have helped Biden meet his goal of cutting the nation’s carbon emissions in half by 2030.

Frustration at Manchin has reached a fever pitch among climate activists, who blame him for blocking the biggest climate bill in U.S. history at a time when extreme drought, record-breaking heat and uncontrollable wildfires threaten wide swaths of the country.

Climate activists in kayaks — or “kayaktivists” — have staged several protests outside Manchin’s houseboat in Southwest D.C. Others have blocked the entrance to the West Virginia power plant tied to his family business, which has made millions by taking waste coal from long-abandoned mines.

When asked whether he has a conflict of interest, Manchin cites a blind trust to justify his voting record. But documents filed by the senator show the blind trust is much too small to account for all his reported earnings from the coal company.

Dave Scott, a fourth-grade teacher in Morgantown, W.Va., who participated in the protest at the coal plant, said he is “disgusted” by what he sees as Manchin’s blatant corruption, although the senator complies with congressional ethics and financial disclosure rules.

“I don’t believe that he’ll ever support anything on climate,” Scott said. “His wealth literally comes from releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.”

But that sentiment is not shared widely in West Virginia, a deep-red state that Donald Trump easily carried in the 2020 presidential election with 68.62 percent of the vote. Many conservative voters here approve of Manchin, who they say is joining Republicans in thwarting Biden’s agenda.

“Joe Biden’s policies are going to make us in really bad shape,” Mary Dolly, a Republican who voted for Trump, said in an interview outside the Walmart in Keyser. “And Joe Manchin’s stopping them. He’s fighting them.”

Jean Weimer, another Trump supporter who was running errands at the store, agreed. “He’s been doing pretty good with the Republicans, so I appreciate that,” she said.

‘Joe forgot about us’

The competing pressures on Manchin stem not only from climate activists and conservatives, but also from factions within the coal industry.

Coal miners have urged the senator to support the social spending bill, which would extend an increased excise tax that funds benefits for miners suffering from black lung disease. Coal mine owners, however, oppose the legislation.

Roughly 25,000 coal miners suffer from black lung, which is caused by inhaling toxic coal and silica dust in underground mines. Doctors have not found a cure for the deadly disease, and Biden’s bill provides a four-year extension for a tax on coal sales funding benefits for sick miners.

Gary Hairston, president of the National Black Lung Association, worked in West Virginia coal mines for more than 27 years before retiring at age 48, when he was diagnosed with the disease. He and other advocates held a rally in Charleston, W.Va., last week to urge Manchin to support Build Back Better.

Advertisement

“It seems like Joe forgot about us,” Hairston, who has been prescribed oxygen and medication to keep his airways open, said in an interview. “He ain’t doing nothing for the coal miners at all.”

In a memo last month, the Labor Department noted that black lung patients will continue to receive benefits even if the excise tax is not extended. But it warned that the Treasury Department would need to borrow money to pay for them, meaning that “taxpayers are footing the bill for black lung benefits, not the coal mining industry.”

Manchin has introduced legislation to provide a 10-year extension of the black lung excise tax rate and will “continue to work to shore up the black lung excise tax to address the needs of our brave miners,” Runyon said.

West Virginia Coal Association President Chris Hamilton, whose group represents mine owners, argues that the administration’s proposal would take away the jobs of the same miners advocating for it.

“They’re Little League coaches. They’re Bible school teachers. They’re spouses or teachers or nurses,” Hamilton said. “I mean, they just make up such a huge portion of our nation’s industrial fabric. And to simply put them out of work or try to force them to take up some other occupation, in my opinion, it’s just extremely callous.”

Autumn Long, a project manager at the Appalachian Solar Finance Fund, which provides financial and technical assistance to solar energy projects in coal communities across Central Appalachia, disputed that notion.

“Not only is it possible for former workers in the coal industry to transition into clean-energy industries, it’s already happening in West Virginia,” Long said. “And I think it’s fair for the state to ask for the resources that we need to successfully make this transition to a 21st-century energy system and to not get left behind.”

Intraparty tensions

On Capitol Hill, Manchin has voted against Democrats’ efforts to not only combat climate change, but also codify the right to abortion and change Senate rules to pass a voting rights overhaul. His utterances have caused a near-daily headache for Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is responsible for shepherding Biden’s priorities through the evenly divided chamber.

Manchin grew frustrated in mid-December when Schumer publicly declared that the Senate would vote on the social spending bill before Christmas, according to two people familiar with the matter. That timeline was at odds with private assurances from Biden a day earlier that the negotiations would continue into January, they said.

The relationship between Manchin and Schumer has improved since that low point, they added. The two met in April to discuss strategies for getting inflation under control: Schumer described the meeting as “preliminary and good” and said the pair would continue talking.

National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, who plays a key role in legislative negotiations, visited West Virginia with Manchin in March. After going zip-lining with the senator near the New River Gorge, Deese took to Twitter to extoll the state.

“Coal and energy communities helped make America what it is, the strongest economy in the world and the global leader of democracy,” Deese wrote. “Nobody should forget that, and President Biden certainly doesn’t.”

The White House declined to comment for this story. When asked about Manchin last month, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean Pierre told reporters, “We’re just not going to negotiate in public.”

A ticking clock

Since negotiations over the spending bill collapsed, Manchin has been meeting with a small group of Republicans to discuss the possibility of a bipartisan energy package that could attract 10 GOP votes in the Senate. The push is typical of Manchin, who believes that reaching across the aisle leads to more durable policy, confidants said.

But his efforts to bridge the partisan divide have their limits, even in West Virginia. This month, Manchin backed Rep. David B. McKinley in the state’s GOP primary over Rep. Alex Mooney, whom Donald Trump endorsed. In a 30-second video ad, Manchin called it an “outright lie” that McKinley supported the Build Back Better bill, as Mooney and his supporters had claimed.

Last week, Mooney prevailed in the primary over McKinley, demonstrating Trump’s enduring appeal in West Virginia and signaling the dilemma Manchin could face if he runs for reelection in 2024.

Hoppy Kercheval, the longtime West Virginia radio host who often has Manchin on his show, noted that West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R) or Gov. Jim Justice (R) could pose a serious challenge.

“There is virtually no chance for a successful challenge to him from the left,” Kercheval said. “But West Virginia’s gone deep red, and there are several Republicans champing at the bit to run for the Senate in 2024.”

At the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Black Rock wind farm, meanwhile, some investors argued that Manchin’s current approach could harm his state’s economy. Clearway Energy Group CEO Craig Cornelius declined to comment on the senator’s actions but warned that if Congress fails to extend the tax credits for clean energy, the company’s plans for additional West Virginia projects will suffer.

“Those incentives are the difference between whether a project gets built in the next two years or the next eight,” Cornelius said.

Manchin’s state projects coordinator, Keith McIntosh, hailed the Black Rock wind farm as a boon for West Virginia in brief remarks to the crowd of clean-energy advocates and state politicians.

“For generations, West Virginia has powered our nation to greatness,” McIntosh said in an apparent reference to coal mining. “And investments like this will ensure our state will remain an energy superpower for generations to come.”

Climate Change Wows the Polls,"Major networks refer to the election as: “Australia’s Climate Election,” with newly elected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese vowing to turn Australia into a “renewable energy superpower.”

The incumbent PM Scott Morrison led the Coalition opposed by the Labor party behind the candidacy of Anthony Albanese. At the end of the day, Labor overwhelmed by capturing the two most significant burning issues: (1) climate change (2) political integrity (What a gorgeous setup for US Dems).

According to NBC News, polling in the lead-up to the election showed that 8 out of 10 Australians wanted significant climate policies from the government. Seventy percent (70%) said climate change was already impacting the country. The environment was the prevailing issue on social media; it captured more interests than the economy or corruption. (Source: Australia’s ‘Climate Election’ Shows Shifting Priority For Voters, NBC News, May 23, 2022)

Analysts claim the public is increasingly demanding climate commitments from leaders in a pronounced shift of political sentiment that could hold lessons for lawmakers in other developed and developing countries. Worldwide climate system failure is too palpable to ignore any longer. It’s showing up at the ballot box.

Segueing to America’s upcoming midterm elections on Tuesday, November 8th: What if America pivots on the same climate and integrity issues? Who wins? The better question may be: How quickly will Republicans pivot, for political expediency purposes only, to support climate mitigation efforts and thus abandon the fossil fuel gravy train of dark funding? Naw! Won’t happen. Instead of abandoning a steady flow of surreptitious green stuff labeled with lots of serial numbers they’ll lie about climate change to “confuse the public.” That’s worked like a charm for decades now. Create doubt. Will it work once again in 2022 and invalidate the great Aussie climate change political reset?

Meanwhile, when it comes to political trends, according to Australian Conservation Foundation’s CEO Kelly O’Shanassy: “The trends across the country show a majority of Australians care deeply for bolder climate action and integrity in politics – it is a huge win for the environment, at a time when nature needs us most.” (Source: Australians Have Voted For Bolder Climate Action and Integrity in Politics, Mirage News, May 22, 2022)

CEO O’Shanassy was quick to point out: “Australians were frustrated by the Morrison government’s inert response to the urgent climate crisis, its reckless support for a ‘gas-led recovery’ and its attempts to water down already weak nature protection laws.”

Whereas, in stark contrast to the Morrison government, the new government under the leadership of PM Albanese will stress “climate action,” It’s what Albanese wants as his legacy.

According to The Sydney Post (May 23rd): “Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will seek a new consensus on climate change with US President Joe Biden on Tuesday in a plan to co-operate on clean energy and build support for global climate talks to be hosted in Australia… Albanese used a phone call with Biden on Sunday, when the US president congratulated him on winning the election, to canvass ways Australia and the US could co-operate on clean energy, including gaining US support for the Labor proposal to host a future United Nations climate summit in Australia and the Pacific.”

On the heels of the Aussie federal election, in a remarkable coincidence of favorable political circumstances and fortuitous timing, Tokyo is holding the Quad Leaders’ Summit with newly elected PM Anthony Albanese and PM Narendra Modi (India), PM Fumio Kishida (Japan) and President Joe Biden.

The White House: “Quad countries share serious concern with the August Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report findings on the latest climate science… Quad countries will focus their efforts on the themes of climate ambition, including working on 2030 targets for national emissions and renewable energy, clean-energy innovation and deployment.”

It is the first time India, Japan, Australia, and the United States have joined hands in concert with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as they agree to tackle a worldwide climate system that’s radically off-course for the first time in human history. But, will they succeed… soon enough? That is the sleepless night tossing turning crux of the matter.

One big loser in the Aussie election is Rupert Murdoch, whose powerful media outlets took a brutal whipping as Australians tossed his views aside and sought new sources of information. According to Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist at Climate Analytics, a prominent think tank, the election demonstrated a transformation across the political spectrum: “We don’t have to believe that the Murdoch press controls public opinion.”

“The election outcome exposes a gaping disconnect between News Corp and Voters.” (The Guardian, May 22nd)

“Anthony Albanese Defeats Rupert Murdoch to Become 31st PM of Australia.” (The Independent Australia, May 23rd)

With America’s midterms right around the corner, the question arises, how will Fox News score?

According to Tom Rosenstiel, a media scholar and executive director at the American Press Institute, a non-profit focused on sustainable journalism: “Fox News is a propaganda machine for the far right and Republican Party.” (Source: Sean Illing, How Fox News Evolved into a Propaganda Operation, Vox, March 2019)

Similar to Rupert Murdoch’s overpowering political clout in Australia, Fox News pounds the American airwaves with whatever “sells best du jour” while fulfilling the deepest suspicions of a rabid core of followers. Will Fox News’ far right extremists win in November or will Australian political sentiments sway America’s political fabric?

Commentary: Inflation looms large over investor sentiment,"Economic and geopolitical uncertainty requires investors to consider their portfolio structure, the impact of monetary policy and evolution of global trade. The ongoing pivot of the economic center of gravity from the U.S. to China presents investors with new growth opportunities while at the same time fulfilling diversification needs. For example, Asian private equity exposure can complement portfolios by providing exposure to areas less accessible via public markets, including early-stage technology.

If given an extra 2% of capital to allocate to equities, some 53% of attendees at GIF Europe said they would overweight China equities (A shares) over a five-year time horizon, rather than overweight the U.S.

High on the agenda for many is the topic of climate transition, even to the degree that a total portfolio transition is becoming essential, with many investors increasingly needing to establish targets for emission reductions for each asset class.

Sustainable investment is an area of investment that is becoming more nuanced and complex, meaning rational decisions and a pragmatic partner are important. Engagement is one of the investment community's most valuable tools to drive meaningful change, but there is a need to be more diligent on matters such as diversity and social progression, as well as climate-related factors.

Sustainable investing is also about having an additional lens of scrutiny by thinking about the implications of the four Rs — return, risk, reputation and regulation — for all investors. For those wanting to make an impact, lessons can be taken from activist investors and bondholders. Many investors will become more ""purpose-driven"" and seek to make an impact with their investments to promote meaningful and measurable change.

The impact financing gap over the next decade is substantial, with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development estimating that $5 trillion to $7 trillion is required by 2030 to meet the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals. This includes investment in areas such as biodiversity, as tremendous species decline threatens food security.

It is important for the investment community to develop a sophisticated climate transition plan — one that is not a box-ticking exercise — but one that is focused on planetary emissions and positioned as part of a broader rethinking of how we use resources. The pivot to a circular economy needs to target those areas that require the most transition and support those areas that are needed for the future green economy.

Having a concrete understanding of today's drivers of future financial developments is imperative to meet tomorrow's investment objectives. Collaboration is crucial to achieving this; and only through cooperation and co-creation can collective aims be achieved.

"Need strong voices against climate of hate being spread, says RLD chief","Chaudhary Jayant Singh says that during the BJP government, terms of trade always remain against farmers and their produce

Chaudhary Jayant Singh says that during the BJP government, terms of trade always remain against farmers and their produce

In his first interview after being elected to the Rajya Sabha as a joint candidate of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the Samajwadi Party, Chaudhary Jayant Singh says he will bring a private member Bill on Equal Opportunity Commission and stand tall against the climate of hate.

Responding to the government’s flip-flop on wheat and sugar exports, Mr. Singh says that during the BJP government terms of trade always remain against farmers and their produce. “Have we ever heard the BJP government putting ban on the export of cement, steel and other things that are used by common people. Things that are made by big industries never face such sort of trade policy.”

Cranes and bulldozers, the RLD chief says, are “symbols of construction” but the way they are being used by the present government, it is very evident that “the government is trying to pit one community against the other.” He says the communal clashes in Rajasthan and Kanpur indicate that “the politics of fear is very much alive and kicking and we have to remain alert if we have to survive this phase.” Edited excerpts:

How do you see the Rajya Sabha membership?

It is a matter of greater honour and privilege. I will remain consistent to issues that I have been raising. I firmly believe that there is an agrarian crisis that needs to be addressed. Also, we need stronger voices against the climate of hate that is being propagated. We need someone who should stand for the constitutional values and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution and protect them. You can call that liberal, which I am. I believe the entire country is essentially liberal.

Will you raise the demand for an Equal Opportunity Commission and caste census?

The government’s decisions should be based on analysis and data. On one hand the BJP wants to enumerate outsiders but on the other it is denying a caste census. A lot of demands for quota go to higher judiciary and there the government is told that the decision making has no basis. One of my first tasks in Parliament will be to raise the demand for an equal opportunity or social justice commission. The core argument is that in society there cannot be discrimination. Can the private sector be above that? I am working on a private member Bill to seek a constitutional, forward-looking body. The SC/ST, OBC commissions are working in a pigeon holed manner and have been reduced to redressal platforms. The proposed body could mandate that every company beyond a certain turnover would be required to provide data so that the consumer would also know that the product he is buying is hiring people from rural background or not. Yes, corporate chambers do some surveys but if we create an institutional framework that sifts the data, does research and then proposes some affirmative actions, it would be better. State governments are saying domicile should be the basis of quota. I don’t agree with it but it shows there is resentment in the local communities of not being represented in the private sector.

There is a sentiment that you would have achieved more in the Assembly?

I agree, there is this sentiment on the ground. I feel I am not a newbie in Indian politics. I cannot remain rooted to my strengths. Given the direction in which the country is headed, we need stronger voices coming together. So I felt there is more space for us today. So I chose a larger canvas. Having said that I will like to see the development of my State. I am very actively working with my legislators to fulfill the promises made in the manifesto, even though we are in the Opposition.

Some observers feel that the decision was guided by the fact that you know Akhilesh Yadav better than his family members? So, instead of spreading wings towards east Uttar Pradesh, you are venturing towards Rajasthan and Haryana.

Akhilesh is a young man and did some good work as the Chief Minister. Recognising his potential, we tied up with him and supported his candidature for the chief ministership. There is no confusion on the role. We will also be going to the east. We have an organisational base there. In the last election, we were not able to get tickets because Om Prakash Rajbhar and the Peace Party had their own claims. This time our role was limited but that doesn’t mean I don’t seek a larger foot print for my party in Uttar Pradesh.

What were the takeaways from farmers’ agitation?

There were green shoots. One is that solidarity across a wide region was achieved and farmers expressed themselves in a vibrant manner on social media. Till the farmers’ agitation, the perception was that nobody could take on the BJP in the social media. During the agitation, ordinary people and farmers became influencers and ultimately the government had to realise that the movement was correct in its core demands. We have to wait and watch for the long term impact on Indian polity.

In hindsight, how do you see the political ambition of farmer leaders and the Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s (SKM) stand on participation in electoral politics?

I respect the SKM’s decision but I don’t understand it. We feel that farmers are under-represented in Indian politics. They can’t remain bystanders. Everything is not about contesting elections but if somebody in our ranks has a political ambition, it should not be considered negative.

But it has been alleged that the RLD denied tickets to Bharatiya Kisan Union leaders?

It is not like that. There may be two points of view on the selection of a particular candidate but those who stood on our ticket had the support of the BKU cadre. We share the same topi. Even the symbolism is the same. Our doors are open for committed farmer activists.

Recently, you changed your Twitter surname to Bishnoi. Is it a political move for the coming Rajasthan polls?

The birth anniversary of my mother, a Bishnoi, falls in June. Also, my cousin said because of a gangster (Lawrence Bishnoi,) the entire community is being tarnished. This is the only community in the country that stands for ecological sustainability, environment and climate change. If they are feeling threatened, we should support. So, I have changed my Twitter handle for a month. More than politics, it is about providing moral leadership.

If Chaudhary Charan Singh could stand in Jat College Baraut and say that a caste’s name must be removed from an educational institution, it was because he had the moral fibre. When he was in government, he introduced a rule. Today, it is called Janta Vedic College.

What is your plan for Rajasthan? Will the alliance with the Congress continue?

I see no reason to change the alliance partner. Our MLA will vote for the Congress candidate in the coming Rajya Sabha polls. At the same time, we are working on creating a strong party structure in the State.

Unlike your father, your ideological commitment seems firm. But don’t you feel ideological commitment of smaller parties is sometimes misused by the big brother in the alliance?

Political astuteness is also important to get the maximum benefits for your people. I am not ruling out new alliances. But we must understand that we are living in a polarised environment. It is becoming harder and harder for anyone to explain a change in positioning. In earlier times, it could happen. Now, you have no right to forget what you once said.

Is there a possibility to go with the BJP?

There is always some shared ground. We all have taken faith on the Constitution. If the common ground expands, a lot of parties would like to ally with them.

Do you think after the recent action against party office-bearers by the BJP, that common ground has added a few inches?

I don’t think so. Their hands were forced because they realised their situation is untenable. It could not be perceived as a shift in their politics.",,[],[]

Opinion: Denser housing at BART stations is climate-smart,"As climate scientists, we strongly support the environmentally superior option of putting the maximum legally-viable amount of mixed-income housing at the Ashby and North Berkeley BART stations. Allowing denser housing at these major, regional transit stations for a variety of income earners represents a once-in-several-generations opportunity to maximize the number of people who can enjoy lower-carbon lifestyles, enabled by easy access to transit and Berkeley’s plentiful jobs. Settling or pushing for less would fly in the face of climate science. Research from the Renewable and Appropriate Laboratory that one of us (Kammen) directs clearly shows that housing policy is climate policy and is an opportunity for social and racial justice, as described in a 2019 New York Times editorial.

In part because Berkeley has been so successful in energy conservation and a transition to renewable sources of electricity, the city’s greatest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is transportation — primarily gas-powered vehicles. Because Berkeley has thousands, if not tens of thousands more jobs than it has homes, thousands of people commute into and out of Berkeley each day, many of them by car. Every home Berkeley builds, therefore, means fewer cars on the region’s roads — that means less air pollution, lower GHG emissions, decreased congestion, and potentially fewer devastating wildfires. Putting these homes near BART so that the people who live there have easy access to public transportation is the climate-smart and common sense thing to do.

Arbitrarily constraining the amount of housing allowed at Ashby and North Berkeley stations or insisting that only subsidized housing (the city has promised an impressive 35% for affordable housing) should be built on these plots would be wholly inconsistent with the actions Berkeley has taken with respect to climate change. In 2018, the City Council declared a “Climate Emergency.” The term “emergency” implies that climate actions should be given the highest priority; conversely, justifying a lack of action should need to clear a very high bar. Arguments against maximizing housing at Berkeley’s BART stations come nowhere near clearing that bar.

We are deeply concerned that — as in other parts of the country — climate misinformation is prevalent even in Berkeley. Groups such as Berkeley Together, North Berkeley Neighborhood Alliance, and Friends of Adeline are spreading climate misinformation that is not grounded in academic research on climate change. In particular, the references to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report are misleading. It is especially galling that these ostensibly “community-minded” groups would actively work against new homes in the midst of a widely documented, crushing housing shortage for all income earners.

For example, these groups have claimed that a denser project made of concrete and steel would be worse for the environment. This is deeply misguided. Unless we expect the people who would otherwise live in Berkeley to go homeless, they are going to live somewhere, and building materials are going to be used for not only the homes they live in, but also the brand new roads they have to drive on. As climate scientists, we would much rather that concrete and steel go toward housing near our BART stations — where people can live car-free and car-lite lifestyles — than to building new highways to far-flung suburbs built over our farms and wildlands.

Some of these same groups have also incorrectly claimed that rooftop solar is more important to meeting our climate goals than creating homes along our transit corridors. This is patently false. According to Berkeley’s most recent greenhouse gas emissions inventory, only about 2% of the city’s emissions resulted from residential electricity use. Moreover, now that Berkeley has elected to receive 100% renewable energy from East Bay Community Energy, this percentage will be even lower, if not zero. On the other hand, transportation accounts for 60% of Berkeley’s GHG emissions. As we explained above, every housing unit in Berkeley potentially represents at least one less person driving in and out of Berkeley each day. That has a much bigger climate impact than a few solar panels.

We are at a critical juncture with respect to climate change, and Berkeley has long prided itself on being a model for meaningful climate action. Putting more housing at the city’s BART stations is one of the most impactful things the city can do to reduce the region’s emissions, while also helping to alleviate the crushing housing shortage. A Council decision to support the legally permitted maximum number of new homes at Ashby and North Berkeley BART stations represents an opportunity for Berkeley to truly “walk the walk” on climate change, and we urge you to take this important step and follow the science.

"Affordability, security, and emissions reductions: The sustainability trilemma","I took up the role of OPEC Secretary General on August 1, 2016. In some ways, it feels like yesterday, but in others, it feels like a lifetime ago given how much the world has changed since then.

Back then, wearing masks in public was frowned upon; the word “fake news” had not gone mainstream; TikTok was something clocks did, rather than a social media phenomenon; and Greta Thunberg was an unheard-of schoolgirl in Sweden.

For OPEC and the global oil industry, the last six years have seen major events and developments, but perhaps four stand out.

The first was the development of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) back in 2016, to counter the severe oil market downturn as a result of the global supply imbalance of 2014-2016. The second was the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The third was the renewed prominence geopolitics have taken in the oil market, particularly in 2022. And the fourth was the ever-evolving discourse around the energy transition.

Allow me here to quote from a former British Prime Minister, a half-American one who also developed close relationships with Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. When Harold Macmillan was asked what the greatest challenge was during his time leading the country, he answered:

“Events, dear boy, events.“

It is a quote that strikes a personal chord. It has been some journey as OPEC Secretary General. I consider myself fortunate to have had a front-row seat for some of the most momentous milestones in the history of this great organization.

In looking at the major events of the past six years, perhaps what they all have in common are two things: globalization and multilateralism.

Certainly, there have been a lot of column inches and boardroom discussions devoted to questions regarding the future of globalization, and indeed, of multilateralism.

For example, investment patterns that have dominated the last three decades such as the idea of cheap offshore manufacturing and slick global supply chains holding costs down and keeping inflation levels low are being put to the test.

The deployment of sanctions and attempts to sever some countries from the global economic system has seen geopolitical fractures spill into the economic sphere. The great Dan Yergin, vice chair of S&P Global, said at Davos last month that he had not seen such a focus on geopolitics in his twenty-five years of coming to the annual World Economic Forum meeting.

We should not be under any illusion that the attempt to “decouple” economies or reverse globalization is a product of the 2020s. Indeed, it has been a refrain for many politicians over the last ten years or so. Many communities have expressed grievances at missing out on the opportunities that come from globalization, or feel aggrieved by it. This has also fed into a skepticism of multilateralism and the multilateral system.

The reasons for this trend are multifaceted. They obviously include geopolitics, but the prospect of trade wars between the world’s largest two economies has cast a long shadow over the global economy during the last six years; the pandemic has had unprecedented impacts, including ongoing supply chain disruptions; and anxiety about affordable access to commodities and food has risen, contributing to this sentiment.

The fate of globalization—or at least the globalization in the form that we have known for the last three decades—possible geoeconomic fragmentation, as well as the future of multilateralism, has consequences for the oil industry that are extremely complex.

I suspect these issues will dominate OPEC’s work for the foreseeable future.

From a personal viewpoint, at times it feels like the world is at an inflection point, shifting away from global dialogue and cooperation to more restrictive silos. It is vital that we keep channels of communication open, work together, and maintain the multilateral approach to dealing with all global challenges.

In this regard, it has been immensely pleasing over the past six years to witness the evolution of the multilateral DoC between OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

It was not an easy task bringing everyone together; it took a great deal of diplomacy, and if I might say, buckets of toil and sweat. The efforts, however, were worth it.

Its collaborative nature, and its comprehensive, adaptable, and robust architecture, has allowed us to face a plethora of challenges head-on and navigate the many bumps in then road that have shaken the global economy.

I am proud to recall the way in which participants in the DoC helped pull the industry back from the brink of catastrophe following the downturn in 2014-2016. It was a monumental effort, but one that helped the industry rise again, like a phoenix from the ashes, and, in turn, had a positive impact on the global economy and worldwide trade.

Having the DoC in place also proved extremely beneficial in 2020, when there was a need to react quickly and forcefully in the face of the devastating pandemic.

We can never forget April 2020. Global demand was down by 20 million barrels a day; WTI plummeted into negative territory. These were visceral events, and I personally recall sitting there open-mouthed watching on TV how quickly WTI plunged on April 20.

But the DoC decisions taken in the same month helped right the ship, and set us on a course, albeit slowly, to recovery.

The DoC has, over the past six years, also been a shelter and a beacon of stability despite any geopolitically-induced turbulence.

The commitment of the DoC to a balanced and sustainable market was evidenced only last week when participants advanced the planned overall production adjustment for September 2022 into July and August. This was quickly welcomed by the US administration.

The importance of the DoC has also received backing from other producers, as well as from consumers. April 2020 proved just what can be achieved with the backing of major producers and consumers at the very highest levels of government.

With regard to the US, I am also personally gratified to have witnessed the evolution of our cooperation with a variety of US stakeholders over the past six years. I have sat in Washington, as well as in Abu Dhabi, and opened talks with US institutions, private sector bodies, and independent organizations.

I believe this stands the organization in good stead, with there now being a clearer understanding among engaged US stakeholders of just what OPEC is about.

It is cooperation, and a word I have already highlighted—multilateralism—that will be vital to OPEC’s and the industry’s future.

This is evident when we look at the energy transition.

It is important to recognize there is no one-size-fits-all pathway. We need to take an all-options approach, an all-solutions approach, and an all-technologies approach.

At OPEC, we fully believe that the oil and gas industries are part of the solution; they possess vital resources and expertise that can help unlock our emissions-free future.

We are fully supportive of an energy transition that draws on the strengths of all energy forms, including oil and gas.

The challenges before us are enormous and complex. We have been delivered a stark reminder of this with the recent strains and conflicts related to energy affordability, energy security, and the need to reduce emissions playing out in regions across the world at the end of 2021 and into 2022.

Focusing on only one of these issues, while ignoring the others, can lead to unintended consequences, such as market distortions, heightened price volatility, and energy shortfalls.

It requires a delicate balancing act, comprehensive and sustainable solutions, and all voices at the table. It is an energy sustainability trilemma, with each piece of the jigsaw having to fit together.

We need to ensure energy is affordable for all; we need to transition to a more inclusive, fair, and equitable world in which every person has access to energy as referenced in UN Sustainable Development Goal 7; and we need to reduce emissions. Oil has a role to play in each part.

To put energy demand growth in some context, we see global energy demand rising by 28 percent in the period by 2045. This clearly requires huge investments.

In the oil industry alone, our World Oil Outlook sees required investments totaling $11.8 trillion through to 2045. These investments are essential for both producers and consumers, particularly given the huge investment drop of 30 percent seen in 2020.

However, we also hear conflicting statements on these issues as exhibited most recently by the G7 Ministers of Climate, Energy and the Environment. They called for oil and gas producing countries, including reference to OPEC, to play a key role in ensuring stable and sustainable global energy supplies, but at the same time committed themselves to end financing for most overseas fossil fuel projects by the end of 2022.

The saying, “You can’t have your cake and eat it too,” comes to mind.

To put it simply: if investments are not made globally, if the capital does not flow, and at the same time if consumers are still demanding the product, we could see further major energy insecurity in various forms.

Here, we also need to be cognizant of how oil and gas industry investments are being impacted by Environmental Social Governance (ESG) practices and the climate disclosure drive from the financial community.

The environmental aspect of ESG is perhaps outweighing the need to address social and development issues.

We need to work with all industry stakeholders to ensure an investment-friendly climate, with sufficient finance along with technology research and transfer; this climate must be sustainable and work for both producers and consumers, both developed and developing countries.

We have no doubt that the resources and expertise of the oil industry can be harnessed again to help develop cleaner and more efficient technological solutions, contributing to a reduction of emissions as part of unlocking a low-emissions future.

For example, carbon capture, utilization, and storage, including direct air capture, blue hydrogen, and other technologies, can be leveraged—along with the promotion of the Circular Carbon Economy—to improve overall environmental performance.

As I mentioned earlier, we need to follow all the right transition paths and appreciate that there is not just one path for all.

Different countries around the world have varying capabilities, needs, and priorities, particularly in relation to equity, historical responsibility and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Thus, reducing emissions has many avenues, as set out by the multilateral Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and we must consider all of them as viable options.

We need to connect all aspects of the energy sustainability trilemma.

German consumer morale inches up after falling to record low -GfK,"People with shopping bags walk near a shopping center, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, in Berlin, Germany December 21, 2021. REUTERS/Annegret Hilse/File Photo

BERLIN, May 25 (Reuters) - German consumer morale is projected to inch up in June after falling to a record low in May, but high inflation and the war in Ukraine continue to weigh on household spending, a survey showed on Wednesday.

The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, rose slightly to -26.0 points heading into June after hitting a revised all-time low of -26.6 points in May.

The latest reading, based on a May 5-16 survey, was in line with analysts' expectations, according to a Reuters poll.

""The consumer climate may have improved slightly, but consumer sentiment is still at an absolute low,"" GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl said in a statement.

""Despite further easing of coronavirus-related restrictions, the Ukraine war and above all the high inflation are weighing heavily on the mood of consumers,"" he added.

The institute said that to see a sustainable reverse in the downward trend, the conflict would need to be brought to an end via successful peace talks and the inflation rate must be noticeably slowed down with the help of the European Central Bank.

Late last month, Germany's economy ministry cut its economic growth forecast for 2022 to 2.2% from 3.6% and predicted that inflation this year would reach 6.1%.

NOTE - The survey period was from May 5 to 16, 2022.

The consumer climate indicator forecasts the development of real private consumption in the following month.

An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop compared with the same period a year earlier.

According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1% in private consumption.

The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?""

The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations about the development of household finances in the coming 12 months.

The additional business cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned of the general economic situation in the next 12 months.

Ally Power could be heading to the UN’s worldwide climate tech summit in November,"Maryland climate tech startup Ally Power just snagged a pretty brag-worthy stamp to add to its passport: The company headed to host country Egypt last week to present for potential participation in the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP27), the annual worldwide climate summit.

Founded in 2019, the Hyattsville, Maryland company develops technology for charging stations for hydrogen-powered vehicles. Hydrogen power is cleaner than other fuels, as it only emits water vapor and warm air. In 2021, Ally Power raised a $40 million funding round for its hydrogen charging stations and participated in the Bethesda Green and Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator programs.

The UN’s annual conference, which follows a 1992 treaty between 154 countries and the European Union, is a decision-making event for delegates from all participating counties and monitors climate change progress. For industry companies such as Ally Power, it’s a chance to present their own technology and ideas for limiting climate change.

A chance for growth

Joseph Alfred, founder and CEO, told Technical.ly that potentially presenting at the November conference is a chance for huge growth and collaboration for the startup.

“A very good sentiment that was shared throughout the entire weekend was: All parties need to be a part of the conversation, regardless of size,” Alfred said. “And we also need to have established industry in the conversation so that they are going to be a part of that transition because they have the financial resources in order to make the changes. If we can showcase to them that there’s an easier path to more carbon reduction, then they will be at the table and continue to be at the table.”

Alfred said that Steve Lutes, VP of the US Chamber of Commerce, notified Ally Power that it had been selected as part of a delegation of US companies asked to present their solutions to the Egyptian government ahead of the conference. Following this, the government will select which solutions and companies it thinks is most promising to participate in the conference and potentially fund.

One of the things Alfred was hoping to learn, the founder said, was whether users would prefer a hydrogen energy hub or an interstate highway system for hydrogen production. (At present, the startup’s technology can be done at both.) He’s confident that his message was heard because since the presentation, the company has scheduled meetings with a large electrical utility in Egypt and the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Egypt, he said.

Why the passion for clean energy in transportation?

The industry is slowly moving up the ranks to be one of the top producers of greenhouse emissions worldwide: “It should be targeted first because it’s the biggest problem,” Alfred said. “That’s what we wanted to showcase.”

Alongside its work at COP27, Ally Power is working with the Department of Energy loan program office for a $60 million loan to develop a mechanism to finance retrofits for individual vehicle owners, Alfred said. And between now and November, he’s also looking to enable retrofitting of Class A, long-haul vehicles.

On the whole, though, he thinks the energy and climate tech spaces are in full bloom, especially in electric batteries, and he’s eager to see where hydrogen technology can go from here.

“There is a transitioning towards greener hydrogen generation sources and in this area, it’s really important to be collaborative,” Alfred said. “If you can attach yourself as a smaller company to larger companies that are in this space, you can create a project that will get funded by a funding entity.”

Climate Change Wows the Polls,"by

Australia’s federal election May 18th turned left with a new power broker named climate change. Major networks refer to the election as: “Australia’s Climate Election,” with newly elected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese vowing to turn Australia into a “renewable energy superpower.”

The incumbent PM Scott Morrison led the Coalition opposed by the Labor party behind the candidacy of Anthony Albanese. At the end of the day, Labor overwhelmed by capturing the two most significant burning issues: (1) climate change (2) political integrity (What a gorgeous setup for US Dems).

According to NBC News, polling in the lead-up to the election showed that 8 out of 10 Australians wanted significant climate policies from the government. Seventy percent (70%) said climate change was already impacting the country. The environment was the prevailing issue on social media; it captured more interests than the economy or corruption. (Source: Australia’s ‘Climate Election’ Shows Shifting Priority For Voters, NBC News, May 23, 2022)

Analysts claim the public is increasingly demanding climate commitments from leaders in a pronounced shift of political sentiment that could hold lessons for lawmakers in other developed and developing countries. Worldwide climate system failure is too palpable to ignore any longer. It’s showing up at the ballot box.

Segueing to America’s upcoming midterm elections on Tuesday, November 8th: What if America pivots on the same climate and integrity issues? Who wins? The better question may be: How quickly will Republicans pivot, for political expediency purposes only, to support climate mitigation efforts and thus abandon the fossil fuel gravy train of dark funding? Naw! Won’t happen. Instead of abandoning a steady flow of surreptitious green stuff labeled with lots of serial numbers they’ll lie about climate change to “confuse the public.” That’s worked like a charm for decades now. Create doubt. Will it work once again in 2022 and invalidate the great Aussie climate change political reset?

Meanwhile, when it comes to political trends, according to Australian Conservation Foundation’s CEO Kelly O’Shanassy: “The trends across the country show a majority of Australians care deeply for bolder climate action and integrity in politics – it is a huge win for the environment, at a time when nature needs us most.” (Source: Australians Have Voted For Bolder Climate Action and Integrity in Politics, Mirage News, May 22, 2022)

CEO O’Shanassy was quick to point out: “Australians were frustrated by the Morrison government’s inert response to the urgent climate crisis, its reckless support for a ‘gas-led recovery’ and its attempts to water down already weak nature protection laws.”

Whereas, in stark contrast to the Morrison government, the new government under the leadership of PM Albanese will stress “climate action,” It’s what Albanese wants as his legacy.

According to The Sydney Post (May 23rd): “Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will seek a new consensus on climate change with US President Joe Biden on Tuesday in a plan to co-operate on clean energy and build support for global climate talks to be hosted in Australia… Albanese used a phone call with Biden on Sunday, when the US president congratulated him on winning the election, to canvass ways Australia and the US could co-operate on clean energy, including gaining US support for the Labor proposal to host a future United Nations climate summit in Australia and the Pacific.”

On the heels of the Aussie federal election, in a remarkable coincidence of favorable political circumstances and fortuitous timing, Tokyo is holding the Quad Leaders’ Summit with newly elected PM Anthony Albanese and PM Narendra Modi (India), PM Fumio Kishida (Japan) and President Joe Biden.

The White House: “Quad countries share serious concern with the August Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report findings on the latest climate science… Quad countries will focus their efforts on the themes of climate ambition, including working on 2030 targets for national emissions and renewable energy, clean-energy innovation and deployment.”

It is the first time India, Japan, Australia, and the United States have joined hands in concert with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as they agree to tackle a worldwide climate system that’s radically off-course for the first time in human history. But, will they succeed… soon enough? That is the sleepless night tossing turning crux of the matter.

One big loser in the Aussie election is Rupert Murdoch, whose powerful media outlets took a brutal whipping as Australians tossed his views aside and sought new sources of information. According to Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist at Climate Analytics, a prominent think tank, the election demonstrated a transformation across the political spectrum: “We don’t have to believe that the Murdoch press controls public opinion.”

“The election outcome exposes a gaping disconnect between News Corp and Voters.” (The Guardian, May 22nd)

“Anthony Albanese Defeats Rupert Murdoch to Become 31st PM of Australia.” (The Independent Australia, May 23rd)

With America’s midterms right around the corner, the question arises, how will Fox News score?

According to Tom Rosenstiel, a media scholar and executive director at the American Press Institute, a non-profit focused on sustainable journalism: “Fox News is a propaganda machine for the far right and Republican Party.” (Source: Sean Illing, How Fox News Evolved into a Propaganda Operation, Vox, March 2019)

Similar to Rupert Murdoch’s overpowering political clout in Australia, Fox News pounds the American airwaves with whatever “sells best du jour” while fulfilling the deepest suspicions of a rabid core of followers. Will Fox News’ far right extremists win in November or will Australian political sentiments sway America’s political fabric?",,[],"['Kenneth Surin', 'Josh Frank', 'Binoy Kampmark', 'L.

Cop27: Africa seeks far-reaching climate action and finance,"Many regions of Africa felt the health impacts of the Covid pandemic less strongly than other parts of the world, but the economic and social effects have still been keenly felt – and none more so than in efforts to tackle climate change.

Construction of projects vital to the greening of the power system dropped behind schedule, while companies charged with supplying solar panels and clean cooking equipment struggled to keep going in the face of disrupted supply chains, movement restrictions and a fall in financial support from the international donor community. At the same time, Africans on low incomes seeking to buy clean energy products such as household solar panels deferred their purchases in the face of an uncertain future.

But there are signs of a revival in the clean energy sector as Covid restrictions ease and business and daily life return to something approximating normal. But it remains to be seen whether the mechanism likely to bring the greatest improvement in climate outcomes on the continent – the UN climate change process – can be cranked up to full speed.

Africa continues to feel the brunt of negative global warming impacts in terms of harsh weather conditions, despite accounting for only around 4% of global carbon emissions. Droughts are becoming longer and hotter and flooding more widespread and intense, shifting some fragile environments from being barely habitable to being uninhabitable. And there are wider impactsbsuch as the effects on the energy sector of rising demand for cooling products, putting strain on electricity supply.

Accounting for current pledges to combat climate change, children born in Africa in 2020 are likely to be exposed to 5-10 times more heatwaves compared to those born in 1960, according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The continent still relies to a large extent on funding from rich nations to finance the measures needed to reverse this process or deal with the consequences, through aid, technology and dealing with the impact of migration.

The UN process is central to dealing with all these consequences of climate change, so it was a blow when the COP26 conference in Glasgow was first delayed by a year due to the pandemic. Then, when it did take place, in November 2021, it failed to deliver as much as had been hoped for, in part because of the disjointed preparations when politicians were focused on the pandemic.

Read more on COP26:

The conference was supposed to be a benchmark climate change meeting where a new raft of meaningful climate change measures would be implemented in a similar fashion to the Paris COP21 meeting in 2015, building on years of hard work to reach broader agreements in the interim. Instead, the outcome was closer to those of the intervening meetings, setting the stage for greater things to come.

James Reeler, WWF South Africa’s senior climate specialist, told African Business in December that COP26 had been “something of a mixed bag” for Africa, even if its outcomes had been more positive than recent conferences.

“It’s not sufficiently ambitious to deal with the current climate crisis, and largely leaves developing nations out in the cold when dealing with climate change, which does not gel with the founding principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change – that those countries responsible and capable of dealing with the crisis must take more action and support others,” he said.

Instead, some of the big decisions were deferred – though perhaps only until this year’s COP27 meeting due to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in November. Reeler said a “saving grace” of COP26 was that the door was left open for increased ambition at the next meeting, rather than locking in the COP26 goals for another five years.

Methane pact could be crucial for Africa

The Glasgow meeting did produce some tangible benefits for Africa, including a potentially highly impactful scheme agreed by 100 countries to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030.

Methane accounts for around a third of man-made global warming. It is also around 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere and remains in the atmosphere for a much shorter period – around nine years rather than thousands of years for some CO2, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

A rapid cut in methane levels is seen as one of the most effective ways to put a brake on global warming, and ameliorate its future impact on Africa. But rapid action is needed. NOAA said the annual increase in atmospheric methane during 2021 was the largest annual increase recorded since systematic measurements began in 1983.

This is an issue of direct relevance to the energy sector. The International Energy Agency estimates that nearly one-third of all methane emissions from human activity are generated from fossil fuel operations. Energy companies have said they are working to reduce methane emissions, but the overall trend in methane emissions remains on an upward trajectory, after a small fall during the Covid pandemic when oil and gas production declined temporarily.

CO2 levels are also continuing to rise. NOAA reported that the global surface average for carbon dioxide during 2021 was 414.7 parts per million (ppm), an increase of 2.66 ppm over 2020. That marks the 10th consecutive year that carbon dioxide increased by more than 2 parts per million – the fastest sustained rate of increase in 63 years since monitoring began.

South Africa benefits from coal reduction drive

African leaders acknowledge that agreement over reducing the use of coal as a feedstock in power stations – responsible for about 40% of annual global CO2 emissions – is also a positive for the climate-vulnerable counties on the continent. But there was disappointment that China and India had weakened the wording of the commitment to ‘phasing down’ coal use, rather than pledging to phase it out in the near term.

However, South Africa, the continent’s largest coal producer, did secure investments and loans of $8.5bn from international partners to transition from coal to green energy – said to be the largest single tranche of climate finance made to date.

South Africa has said the funding would help state energy company Eskom to reduce carbon emissions. However, the government has yet to commit to a date for phasing out coal – a Herculean task given that, despite a steady reduction in the share of coal in the overall energy mix, coal-fired power still accounts for 70% of South Africa’s electricity generating capacity. Urgent action is need as South Africa accounts for almost a third of African carbon emissions, mainly due to its coal habit.

At the same time as pushing coal usage down, South Africa also intends to invest in the growing green hydrogen economy, seeking to become a global hub by harnessing its copious solar and wind resources to produce hydrogen using electrolysis, a power intensive but clean method of production compared to commonly used methods using fossil fuels with carbon emissions as a by-product. South Africa has an added incentive to develop green hydrogen because it is a major source of platinum, which is used as a catalyst in the electrolysis process.

Overall financing comes up short

But overall, international support for climate change measures in Africa has fallen short of expectations. Developed countries still haven’t met a target set in 2009 to invest $100bn a year to help meet developing countries’ climate adaptation and mitigation needs – and many believe that even that amount is not enough.

Tariye Gbadegesin, managing director of ARM Harith Infrastructure Fund told African Business at the end of COP26 that $100bn a year “should be a floor and not a ceiling”, given the cost of the global climate transition was estimated to be between $100 trillion and $130 trillion.

“For Africa alone, just the cost of energy access is $100bn, so $100bn across developing economies – it’s not enough. Nigeria estimated the cost of its energy transition to net zero over 30 years to be $400bn, so it’s just not enough, and the developed economies really need to do better,” she said.

Support for underdeveloped countries is still below the $100bn/year agreed at the Paris Climate Summit while financial flows are 3-6 times lower than levels needed by 2030 to limit warming to <2°C, according to the IPCC.

The AfDB estimates that between $1.3trn-$1.6 trn will be needed over 2020-30 to implement Africa’s climate action commitments and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are individual country climate action targets. That’s an annual $118bn-145bn.

But if current trends continue, a climate financing gap of $99.9bn-127.2bn a year will remain by 2030, undermining Africa’s efforts to support climate resilience and a just energy transition.

Gbadegesin said there were concerns over the accessibility and relevance of that capital, even where it was forthcoming, “Many developing economies were just complaining through the hallways of COP about how virtually impossible it is to access even the little amount of capital that is committed,” she added.

Her remarks echo a sentiment often heard around the continent that climate finance has often been easier to mobilise for more resilient countries with more stable economies that for those most vulnerable to climate shocks.

Climate finance is also hard to keep track of and measure adequately. “The global climate finance landscape is highly fragmented, leaving accountability for climate finance flows opaque and hard to measure objectively,” the African Development Bank (AfDB) said in its African Economic Outlook 2022.

The Bank noted that climate-related projects had increasingly been funded by debt instruments on non-concessional terms rather than concessional loans or grants.

“The 33% of debt-financed climate projects in Africa on non-concessional terms could have increased Africa’s debt burden and exacerbated debt sustainability challenges, further undermining the continent’s climate resilience capacity,” the AfDB said.

There are philanthropic, blended finance and private initiatives bolstering funding for green energy, climate resilience measures and other climate finance measures on less onerous terms. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund pledged $2bn to the cause, and the Bezos Earth Fund also joined the Rockefeller Foundation, IKEA Foundation and other philanthropic institutions in supporting the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), which aims to mobilise $100bn in public and private capital to go towards adapting to climate change over the next decade. Investment partners in the project include the AfDB, the European Investment Bank and the World Bank.

COP27: implementation is the word

Hopes are now pinned on the outcome of COP27, a conference taking place on African soil, to make faster headway in turning aspirations for tackling the continent’s climate change needs into well-targeted action on the ground.

The host government is making all the right noises. UN Officials have said the meeting should be treated as a climate summit for Africa, while Egypt has said it intends to launch a plan for the energy transition in the continent during the climate summit, with an emphasis on mobilising climate finance.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, the president-designate of COP27, told AP in May that the overall goal was implementation. “The commitments and the pledges now have to be implemented in all sectors of the climate change agenda, whether it’s in adaptation, mitigation or finance, loss and damage,” he said.

Egypt relies on natural gas — which it also produces – for most of its electricity production. But Shoukry said he did not regard fossil fuels as part of the solution to climate change.

“We might see in gas a transitional source of energy with certainly less emissions. But I think we have to really move quickly to the net zero goal and we have to apply ourselves more effectively in new technologies, in renewable energy,” he told AP.

Egypt has been one of the most proactive countries in Africa in terms of investment in renewable energy. In addition to pouring investment into large wind and solar farms, the government signed a number of agreements in early 2002 to develop green infrastructure projects. These included a memorandum of understanding with green energy firm Scatec for a $5bn development to produce green ammonia from green hydrogen by the Suez Canal.

Covid spending shows what’s possible

The huge scale of the response to the Covid pandemic shows that, given the right impetus, vast sums can be directed at a global problem.

“The scale of fiscal measures mobilised by the world in response to COVID-19 ($17 trillion) within two years indicates that the tools and resources to meet the climate finance commitments exist – if political will is mobilised,” the AfDB said in its Economic Outlook.

The Bank also offered up a series of policy recommendations which are likely to be central to debate in Sharm-El-Sheikh in November. Firstly, it said developed countries should honour their commitment to provide $100bn annually to developing countries to support climate action and that this should be new and additional resources, distinct from official development assistance (ODA) commitments and financing from multilateral development banks (MDBs).

“Innovative financing instruments, such as green bonds and loans, sustainability or sustainability-linked bonds and loans, debt-for-climate swaps, and more efficient and better-priced carbon markets, could provide much-needed domestic resources to support Africa’s ambition to achieve a net-zero transition by 2050,” according to the Bank.

It said institutional capacity development, along with regulatory and other policy reforms, are urgently needed to support and accelerate climate finance from domestic and external sources – public and private – for climate resilience and a just energy transition in Africa. It also said MDBs, development finance institutions, and bilateral development agencies should make available a greater volume of concessional finance instruments and grants to support climate adaptation and a just energy transition in Africa.

“Climate change is a global commons problem, demanding global cooperation for sustainable resolution. Accelerating climate finance for climate resilience and a just energy transition in Africa is in the interest of the whole of humanity’s future,” the AfDB said.",,[],[]

Republicans plan legislative assault on ‘woke’ ESG firms,"The Republican crusade against green investing and “woke” corporate policies could soon turn into a concrete legislative agenda.

Republicans, if they take back Congress in the midterms, plan to pursue legislation against environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investing, part of an effort to push corporations and the financial sector away from pro-climate rhetoric and make them re-embrace fossil fuels.

It’s an issue with an increasingly national profile that could gain traction on the campaign trail. Already, GOP lawmakers are honing the message and putting a target on major investment firms, namely money manager BlackRock Inc. Some have even accused major oil companies and financial institutions of being too “woke.”

“That argument’s going in our favor,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) said in an interview, pointing to BlackRock’s announcement last month that it would support fewer climate-related shareholder proposals this year. “That’s a big reversal, and I think it’s also an indication that they’re worried about their competitiveness.”

The anti-ESG sentiment on Capitol Hill follows a trend simmering in red states around the country.

Texas enacted a law last year to bar state investment and retirement funds from doing business with companies that “boycott” fossil fuels. Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar sent letters earlier this year to 19 firms probing their stances on fossil fuels and green investment funds. Most said they planned to continue financing fossil fuels (Climatewire, May 31).

State officials in Utah penned a letter earlier this year, signed by the state’s congressional delegation, denouncing S&P Global Ratings for a plan to incorporate ESG indicators into state credit ratings.

West Virginia, meanwhile, announced in January that it would stop doing business with BlackRock — the world’s largest asset manager — because of the company’s climate commitments.

In the likely event that Republicans take over one or both chambers of Congress next year, the state trend could quickly turn federal.

“Forever and ever, board members’ primary responsibility was fiduciary responsibility to shareholders,” Rep. John Curtis (R-Utah) said in an interview. “Somehow, without legislation, that has changed, and shareholders I think are being duped, not knowing that those who are representing them aren’t representing their financial interest.”

Former Vice President Mike Pence took up the cause with an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal last month, urging federally elected Republicans to “end the use of ESG principles nationwide.”

“The woke left is poised to conquer corporate America and has set in motion a strategy to enforce their radical environmental and social agenda on publicly traded corporations,” Pence wrote.

Targeting proxy voting

Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) on Capitol Hill. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) introduced legislation to that effect last month. The “Investor Democracy Is Expected Act” would require managers of passive investment funds to vote proxies based on the wishes of individual investors.

Asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard Group Inc. manage trillions of dollars for individual investors and can use their clients’ shares in major companies to cast proxy votes on shareholder proposals. Climate advocates and sustainable investor groups have pushed them to wield that influence on climate-related shareholder proposals with mixed success (Climatewire, June 2).

In a prominent example last year, BlackRock and other major money managers supported a successful bid by Engine No. 1 to install three new directors on Exxon Mobil Corp.’s board in an effort to push the company to reduce its carbon emissions.

It was a major shake-up, but Republicans say moves like those should be decided more directly by the individual investors.

“They should not be able to vote for shares that they don’t own or control. We need to get rid of the perverse incentives to push ESG,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a member of the Senate Banking Committee and a co-sponsor of Sullivan’s bill.

In the House, Curtis said his party would “clearly” attempt to move anti-ESG legislation should it take control.

Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.), a member of the Financial Services Committee, in March introduced the “Ensuring Sound Guidance Act,” which would require retirement plan sponsors and investment advisers to prioritize financial returns over other concerns like sustainability.

Georgia Rep. Rick Allen, the top Republican on the House Education and Labor Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions, is a co-sponsor, and Barr said the plan would be to try to push the bill through committee if the GOP takes control in the midterms.

“Republicans on the Financial Services Committee are very, very interested in proxy advisory reform because there’s a lot of manipulation going on in terms of who goes on these boards,” Barr said. “And the question is, are shareholder proxies being properly managed?”

GOP lawmakers said they also plan to target the landmark proposed rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission that would require publicly traded companies to disclose their climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions.

Barr made clear that protecting fossil fuels from sustainable investing advocates looking to spur the energy transition is a major motivator.

“This is about maximizing investor returns,” Barr said in an interview. “It’s also about making sure that the energy sector has the financing that they need to both innovate for climate and also provide affordable energy for the American people.”

It’s something of a political tightrope for Republicans, who have never stopped advocating for more domestic fossil fuel production but have tried in recent years to step away from outright climate change denial.

Curtis, who also leads the Conservative Climate Caucus, said the goal of activist investors is “to kill fossil fuels and not to reduce emissions.”

“ESG should not be knocking the legs out from underneath these companies because they’re willing to put billions into new technology,” Curtis said. “They have the scientists, engineers, and when the ESG movement attacks them and takes away capital or their ability, I think we’re actually hurting ourselves.”

‘Inappropriate ESG pressure’

Proponents of ESG investing say it’s here to stay and that pushing for sustainability is in the best interest of investors.

In his annual open letter to CEOs this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote that “every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world.”

“Sustainable investments have now reached $4 trillion,” Fink said. “Actions and ambitions towards decarbonization have also increased. This is just the beginning — the tectonic shift towards sustainable investing is still accelerating.”

At the same time, Fink said BlackRock is moving to “give more of our clients the option to have a say in how proxy votes are cast at companies their money is invested in.”

But anti-ESG sentiment has only continued to fuel the culture war, part of a broader campaign by Republicans to portray corporate America as bowing to “woke” liberal activists.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), for instance, last month blamed Fink for high gas prices.

“Every time you fill up your tank, you can thank Larry for the massive and inappropriate ESG pressure,” Cruz said on CNBC.

And during a hearing with Big Oil executives in April, Crenshaw said the companies were acting like they “have Stockholm syndrome” by playing to environmentalists’ demands for clean energy and urged them not to “pander to what they want on the left” (E&E Daily, April 7).

“I don’t think they’re genuinely woke,” Crenshaw said in a subsequent interview. “I think they do their risk assessments, and I think they read the playing field wrong, especially the bigger ones.”

ESG was in the national spotlight again last month, when Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk called ESG a “scam” that has been “weaponized by phony social justice warriors.” The comment came in response to the S&P 500 removing Tesla from its “ESG index,” even though Exxon Mobil Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. had made the list (Climatewire, May 25).

‘The noise in your right ear’

The right-wing push against ESG is an increasing worry for Democrats, who have been prodding major financial institutions for years to participate more fully in the energy transition and address their risk from the physical impacts of climate change.

While Republicans would be hard-pressed to pass anti-ESG legislation into law with President Joe Biden still in the White House, their oversight of the new SEC climate proposal and of other financial regulators promises to be intense.

“I do think that’s a concern. It’d be hard for them to go after independent efforts — organizing to elect board of directors sympathetic to ESG or corporations that are exercising their own First Amendment rights to do that,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). “But I do think they could try to gut the SEC regulations and certainly will be a voice against climate policy, which is why these elections matter.”

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) said he views the ESG backlash as an understandable reaction for lawmakers who represent fossil fuel districts and states threatened by climate policy and the energy transition.

“Republicans are delivering [for fossil fuel interests]. They’re going to continue to deliver. It’s going to be bad for the economy. It’s going to be bad for the environment. It’s going to be bad for inflation,” Casten said. “But I understand why they’re doing it.”

Cramer acknowledged the politics Republicans are playing in the battle over ESG. But he said he sees himself in a political back-and-forth with climate and investor advocates pushing ESG investing and pro-climate shareholder proposals.

“As I say to [JPMorgan CEO] Jamie Dimon and [Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO] David Solomon and [Citigroup Inc. CEO] Jane Fraser and all the rest … if there’s a lot of noise in your left ear, I’m going to be the noise in your right ear,” Cramer said.",,[],['Nick Sobczyk']
"Urgency, ambition, political commitment, and follow-through: A high-level dialogue on strengthening disaster and climate risk governance - World","The 7th Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (GPDRR) is taking place at a critical juncture in our planet’s history.

A lived experience of climate disruptions

For children born today, their lived experience will be of climate disruption. They are likely to experience three to four times as many extreme climate events as their grandparents, said Mark Howden, Director of the Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions at the Australian National University, speaking at a GPDRR High-Level Dialogue on ‘Strengthening disaster and climate risk governance at national and local levels for accelerated progress on SDGs’ on 25 May 2022.

Selwin Hart, Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on Climate Action and Assistant Secretary-General for the Climate Action Team, noted that these impacts would be unevenly distributed.

“If you are living in Central or South America; in Central, East, or West Africa; in South Asia; or in a small island developing state, you are 15 times more likely to die in a climate impact.”

Despite this, he pointed out, only 20 to 25% of all climate-related investment is spent on adaptation and resilience.

“We need to pursue reducing emissions and pursue protecting people and safeguarding livelihoods with the same degree of urgency and ambition,” he said.

“We have a moral imperative to protect those that have done least to put us in this situation or to cause the climate crisis.”

Systemic solutions for a systemic problem

“This is a systemic problem which requires systemic solutions,” Howden said. “The impacts of climate change are already being felt across every continent, every island, every ocean, and across every sector.”

The IPCC report, of which Howden is an author, notes an increase in compound, concurrent, cascading, and aggregate events.

A compound event is one where there are “multiple, related climate events happening at one time, that collectively increase the risk” – for example simultaneous heatwaves, droughts and fires, that together have an impact on risk – as Howden explained.

Cascading risks are events where a climate disruption triggers a chain of other climate disruptions.

“In the really huge fires we had in Australia two years ago,” Howden explained, “the fires took out the electricity system. So that took out the banking system, so people couldn’t get hold of their money, and it also took out the petrol distribution system… and it took out the mobile phone communication system… so even if people had petrol in their cars they didn’t know where to drive because they didn’t know where the fires were. That’s cascading risk.”

An example of aggregate risk, which involves separate and independent risks, would be a climate related hazard, like a fire or a cyclone, and COVID-19.

“So when people need to seek refuge, they crowd into a limited space which means they are exposed to the additional risk from COVID.”

The nature of the risks determines the solution, Howden said. “For example, if you have a cascading risk, all you have to do is prevent one link of that cascade, and you can stop it from happening.”

The options to manage climate risks decreases with increased climate change – it is essential to both reduce emissions to slow climate change while adapting and reducing disaster risks.

A systemic solution, Howden noted, relies on political commitment and follow-through.

The political will for a coordinated approach

Other participants at the Dialogue echoed this sentiment. Filimon Manoni, Deputy Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, said that the Pacific Resilience Partnership has improved coordination and collaboration in managing disaster risks in the region. Examples include the Disaster Risk Finance Technical Working Group, which provides capacity support around financial protection against disasters; and tools such as the Pacific Resilience Standards.

“Going forward, if we are to do better in the governance of risk, we need to consider a number of important things.” he said.

“First, a shared vision of resilience that is owned by all, and that is backed by political will at the highest level. Second, we must continuously examine our systems so that continuity and sustainability is maintained. Lastly, access to robust and contextualized data is also crucial.”

Natalia Gómez Solano, President of the Costa Rican Youth and Climate Change Network, called for greater inclusion of youth in disaster risk and climate governance.

“For the youth, we ask governments to unify mechanisms, systems and institutions, and to accelerate the SDGs.”

“We know that climate change affects the future of youth and children, which constitutes a really vulnerable group,” she said.

“Our group is asking for solutions as hazards are changing faster than policies and actions. Children and youth are change makers and mobilizers.”

“You have to make friends before you need them”

Jochen Steinhilber, Director General for Displacement, Crisis Prevention and Civil Society of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, said that integration is a key element of making progress against disaster and climate risks.

“We need to use existing institutions to the best extent possible to avoid any further fragmentation at the global, the national and the local level,” he said.

Germany is committed to using its presidency of the G7 to improve resilience, especially for the most vulnerable.

“Building on the InsuResilience Global Partnership, and efforts to enable faster and better disaster response, and to close the financial protection gap in vulnerable countries, we are mobilizing support under our G7 presidency to work towards a global shield against climate risk.”

Germany has also committed to strengthening anticipatory action, for “more proactive, forward-looking humanitarian assistance.”

“There is growing awareness that pre-arranged finance can enable faster and more effective assistance,” he said.

There is a saying in German, Steinhilber noted: “You have to make friends before you need them.”

“This is the same for finance: When a disaster strikes, pre-arranged solutions ease the burden, they lower the costs, and reduce fiscal impacts.”",,[],[]
"Fonterra asked the Government to change the law. In doing so, it risks increasing both pollution and milk prices","By swooping in to help Fonterra with a dramatic law change, the Government is, essentially, rescuing Fonterra from the Government.

ANALYSIS: Sometimes, the Government wants to fight the climate crisis, improve freshwater quality, and address the rising costs of household essentials.

Then there are other times, where it enthusiastically supports a move that would expand the power of our largest near-monopoly, increase the dairy industry’s environmental hoofprint, and, for good measure, likely raise the price of dairy products.

The Government is proposing a law change that would allow Fonterra to increase its already significant market share, making it harder for smaller competitors to compete and more difficult for Fonterra farmers to leave the co-op.

The logic is that a more powerful Fonterra will bolster the economy as it navigates the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Cabinet has moved to pass the law ""as expeditiously as possible”, according to a recent Cabinet paper, even as many uncertainties remain.

* Fonterra capital changes should get Government tick of approval by next season, O'Connor says

* Fonterra farmers vote in favour of capital structure changes



This has all happened quickly, with little apparent scrutiny of the potential consequences.

What’s going on?

Let’s start with Fonterra. It’s the massive dairy co-operative that controls around 80% of milk processing in New Zealand.

It was formed through a merger in 2001. To make the merger happen, the Government had to pass the Dairy Industry Restructuring Act (DIRA), effectively overriding regulations that ensure market competition.

The new co-operative, Fonterra, was large enough to compete internationally, and it immediately dominated the local market, becoming a powerful force both economically and politically.

Fonterra is so powerful that, when it sets its milk prices, they become the de facto industry standard.

That being said, Fonterra’s dominance has gradually slipped. Independent processors such as Open Country Dairy and Synlait Milk have chipped away at its market share, and have taken around 20% of the dairy processing market.

At the same time, milk production nationally has flat lined, and will soon fall. According to Fonterra’s projections, farmers will produce around 2.4% less milk in 2030 than they do today.

With the economic weirdness from the pandemic ongoing, a strong Fonterra could be an anchor in rough economic seas. So it asked the Government for a favour.

STUFF Fonterra factors in fat and protein levels in milk when buying it off farmers.

What are they doing about it?

To manage a declining milk supply, Fonterra is pursuing a capital restructure, which will fundamentally transform the business.

The details are complicated, but at the highest level, the restructure would:

Make it easier for new farmers to join Fonterra.

Make it harder for existing farmers to leave Fonterra.

Make Fonterra more beholden to its farmer-shareholders, rather than external investors.

If this is all you need to know, feel free to skip to the next section. Here is the more detailed explanation.

Under the current rules, any farmer who supplies milk to Fonterra must buy one share for every kilogram of milk solids (MS) they produce.

This can be expensive for farmers. If Fonterra’s share price is $5, for example, a farmer producing 150,000kgMS - which is close to what the average dairy farm produces - must hold Fonterra shares worth $750,000.

They can buy more shares if they want to, but no more than double their milk solid production.

Shares tied directly to milk production (and are therefore compulsory) are called “wet shares”. The rest are called “dry shares”. Under its constitution, Fonterra’s balance of wet shares and dry shares cannot exceed 85:15. This ensures farmers producing milk control the co-op.

All well and good. But this becomes complicated when milk production falls.

When this happens, the number of wet shares falls, causing a commensurate increase in dry shares. To keep within the required wet/dry ratio, Fonterra would have to buy a lot of dry shares - this could cost the co-op as much as $1.2b over 10 years, it says.

Sungmi Kim/Stuff Anchor's range is part of the Fonterra family.

Fonterra would rather spend that money elsewhere. Which is why the co-op put an offer to its farmers.

Farmer-shareholders would only need one share for every 3kgMS they produce, reducing the amount of capital they need to invest in the business by two-thirds. They could also voluntarily hold a lot more shares if they want to – up to four times their milk production.

For the above-mentioned farmer, they would need at least 50,000 shares, but could have as many as 600,000.

This gives more flexibility to a milk supplier; a farmer who currently has between $750,000 and $1.5m invested in Fonterra could soon have between $250,000 and $3m.

There’s nothing technically stopping Fonterra from going ahead with this. But there’s a flow-on consequence that means it won’t.

There are currently two ways to invest in Fonterra. One is a private market only for farmer shareholders, who can trade wet and dry shares between each other. The other is a linked unit fund, which is listed on the stock exchange and reserved mostly for external investors.

The logic of having this unit fund is to provide a sense of Fonterra’s share value in the wider market. The unit fund is capped at 20% of all Fonterra shares, but currently sits around 7%.

Farmers can exchange their dry shares for units in the fund, which is an easy way to sell out of Fonterra.

Here’s the problem: Lowering the capital requirements for Fonterra farmers would free up around one billion dry shares, many of which would likely be disposed of through the unit fund. This would grow the fund significantly, making Fonterra more beholden to external investors.

Christel Yardley/Stuff Fonterra controls around 80% of New Zealand’s milk.

Hence, the second major plank of the changes: Fonterra wants to partially close this linkage between the two markets, making it harder for Fonterra farmers to cash out. It also wants to limit the unit fund’s size to no more than 10% of shares.

Doing all these things will have a cost.

It is likely to come with an immediate $2.5b hit to Fonterra’s balance sheet, and crash the share price anywhere between 20% and 60%. Farmers who bought shares before the changes – which they were required to do – suddenly have shares that are worth less, and harder to get rid of.

But by making it easier for new farmers to join Fonterra and harder for existing farmers to leave, while maximising payouts to its farmers rather than external investors, Fonterra is hoping it can poach farmers from smaller processors and increase its market share, undoing the expected fall in milk production.

Unsurprisingly, when put to a vote, 85% of Fonterra’s farmers supported the proposal.

What’s this have to do with the government?

Fonterra’s problem is that it’s not sure if it can legally do this.

If it went ahead under current law, it might get sued – to borrow a phrase, it’s in ‘pretty legal’ territory.

The Government can help. By amending DIRA, the law that created Fonterra, the co-op can go ahead with its restructure without fear of being sued.

In the Cabinet paper detailing the Government’s proposed response, it lays out the reasons for supporting the co-op’s plan: “Fonterra’s short to medium-term performance is crucial during the current environment of declining domestic milk supply, growing international competition, and wider economic and geo-political disruptions,” it says.

That’s why it’s moving with unusual speed to get this over the line, hoping to have the law passed before the end of the year.

This comes with risk. By helping out Fonterra, the Government is tacitly endorsing the flow-on consequences of the co-op’s plan.

There are potentially many, which have been given little substantive analysis and, in some cases, directly contradict Government policy elsewhere.

Go on...

Remember the reason this all came about: The supply of milk has flat lined, and will likely decline.

The main reason for this, according to Fonterra, is the government, namely through its environmental regulations: Specifically, the 2020 freshwater reforms, and the upcoming pricing of agricultural emissions, either through the Emissions Trading Scheme or the farmer-determined He Waka Eke Noa.

Both, of course, originate from the Government currently in power. Each policy sought to reduce the dairy industry’s impact on the environment, in response to public concerns about the freshwater and climate crises.

A reduction in milk production is – environmentally speaking – a vindication of those policies. As the environmental advocacy group Forest & Bird says in its submission on the Fonterra proposal, the challenge of flat lining or declining milk production for Fonterra “is not the Government’s problem – in fact, they’re a good thing for the environment and for climate change”.

“Amending DIRA to protect Fonterra from changes in the market – such as from public sentiment or legislation designed to protect the environment – is an inappropriate use of public policy,” it argues.

By swooping in to help Fonterra with this law change, the Government is, essentially, rescuing Fonterra from the Government.

How bad would this be for the environment?

The officials who looked at Cabinet’s proposal were unable to say with any certainty.

This is strange. The Government can, through a Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA), assess a Bill’s impact on the climate while it's being drafted. It has not done so in this case, because the emissions would be “indirect” - a somewhat arbitrary distinction, from the climate’s perspective.

The officials responsible for CIPA did note, however, that the changes were “likely to support an increase in emissions”. And because Fonterra is so large, even a minor change in milk production will have a large impact.

There are logical reasons to assume these changes would be bad for the environment.

For example, Fonterra will have a strong incentive to increase the milk price for its farmer-shareholders; a higher milk price means farmers will want to produce more milk, which likely means more cows, more nutrient leaching, more climate heating burps.

STUFF In 2020, a part of New Zealand saw 61 days of drought in a row. For many, it was devastating.

Whatever one makes of the plan, it is clear that environmental issues have played little role in its consideration. Notably, before the Cabinet paper was considered, six Government agencies were consulted - the Ministry for the Environment was not among them.

What about consumers?

The other potential issue here is the price of dairy products.

A higher milk price is good for farmers, and good for rural communities - but someone has to pay for it. Unless Fonterra or the supermarkets decide to absorb those costs, they’ll be passed onto consumers.

It is another incongruity for the Government, which has vowed to tackle profiteering in the supermarket sector, and temporarily lowered the cost of petrol, in response to the rising cost of essential goods.

This potential hit to consumers is also raised in MPI’s discussion document: “Higher prices for farmers’ milk could flow through to New Zealand consumers,” it says, which would “represent a cost increase to the manufacturers of domestic dairy products”.

An economic report commissioned by Fonterra’s largest competitor, Open Country Dairy, was more firm in its prediction: “The restructure’s effects [on prices] will be unavoidable”, it said.

“There are no workable solutions that could keep domestic milk products at lower prices than international commodities without serious flaws and unintended consequences.”

The Government could, if it wanted to, strictly regulate how Fonterra sets its milk price. It has thus far explicitly rejected doing so - in the Cabinet paper, Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor says that powers to strictly regulate the milk price “would be complex both to draft and implement”.

CHRISTEL YARDLEY/STUFF Dairy farming remains central to the export economy and many rural communities, such as Morrinsville.

What next?

If the Government – and Fonterra – go ahead with this capital restructure, it will have a range of consequences – some good, and some bad.

It would be unfair to characterise this move purely in negative terms. Agriculture has proved resilient during the pandemic in ways tourism, for obvious reasons, has not. It’s possible that existing rules, particularly around freshwater, will prevent a meaningful increase in dairy’s environmental impact. Farmers having more money in their pockets could itself drive environmental improvements.

But it’s also reasonable to question how this adheres to the Government’s stated environment ambitions, particularly in regard to the climate crisis, and why so little analysis of the environmental consequences was undertaken before it was so enthusiastically supported by Cabinet.

The stakes are high. As MPI’s discussion document notes, “Fonterra’s capital restructuring also creates long-term risks and potential flow-on impacts, which could be detrimental to farmers, the diversity and contestability of the whole dairy industry, Fonterra’s long-term performance, and the wider New Zealand economy.”

Those things might not happen. But based on the available information, the Government appears unwilling to slow down and think it through before forging ahead. The milk must flow.",,[],['Charlie Mitchell']
LGPS board chair’s TCFD appeal to minister runs aground,"The chair of the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board believes that the government missed the opportunity to introduce new climate-related reporting rules for local authority schemes with COP26, after a request sent to the minister of state for Levelling Up Communities mysteriously failed to reach its intended recipient.

Councillor Roger Phillips wrote to Kemi Badenoch last year on behalf of the SAB, requesting that Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures regulations for LGPS schemes should be brought forward for the COP26 climate conference. These rules have yet to be confirmed.

“I saw the window of opportunity of getting the TCFD requirements for local government as part of the government’s ‘great, this is what we’re doing coming up to Glasgow’. I would have thought that this was a no-brainer,” Phillips told the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association’s local authority conference on June 14.

You can understand the appeal for consistency across this piece, because this is an incredibly difficult part of reporting to deal with, as the Department for Work and Pensions is already discovering in private pension schemes Roger Phillips, Scheme Advisory Board

DLUHC yet to issue LGPS TCFD rules

Since October 2021, private sector schemes with more than £5bn of assets have had to comply with TCFD rules. From October this year, this scope will widen to schemes with more than £1bn in assets.

The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities is responsible for issuing LGPS-specific rules to set out the TCFD regime for local authority pension funds.

“My understanding is that the civil servants, in the team there, had sent it to her,” Phillips told the conference.

“Something happened in the political processes in between, and it is a matter for conjecture elsewhere as to what happens and how government runs itself, and how it gets these policies off the starting grid.”

In a sign of potentially competing legislative priorities, the government has separately asked LGPS funds to allocate 5 per cent of their assets towards local infrastructure, a proposal that received the SAB’s support in a letter sent to Badenoch, after Phillips eventually met with the minister in April 2022.

In this letter, Phillips sought clarity on the government’s definitions and expectations for the idea, echoing these sentiments to the PLSA conference on June 14.

He appealed to Badenoch for government assistance in overcoming hurdles to infrastructure investment, including those concerning cost and scale.

Consistency needed

Phillips said that when he met Badenoch in April, he “did say how extremely disappointed we were that the TCFD regulations had not come out, because we are very anxious to ensure that we are reporting on these issues.”

“We are an extremely public pension fund. We are in the public eye, we are getting the freedom of information requests on a regular basis,” he added.

“It will be tasked to us as a SAB to make an annual report of what we are doing as funds, and as a scheme.

“You can understand the appeal for consistency across this piece, because this is an incredibly difficult part of reporting to deal with, as the Department for Work and Pensions is already discovering in private pension schemes,” Phillips continued.

“It was a great pity that it wasn’t there for COP26 in Glasgow,” he noted, citing advice that the rules will be released before COP27 in November 2022.

LGPS advisory board chair appeals for infrastructure clarity The government needs to provide a clearer definition of the kind of infrastructure investment it wants public sector schemes to carry out as part of its levelling up agenda, the chair of the Local Government Pension Scheme advisory board has said.

“The biggest concern I have with it is how we actually get the mechanisms and that consistency of approach across all the funds,” Phillips said.

"Retail sales were up in April, but consumers remain under pressure","BUSINESS

Despite the tough economic times, South African consumers were buying furniture, appliances and textiles in April this year. Data from Statistics SA show that retail sales were up 3.4% in April from a revised 1.7% in March this year.

The largest contributors were broad, with retailers in household furniture, appliances and equipment leading and adding 6.8% points, retailers in textiles, clothing, footwear and leather goods contributed 6.4% and general dealers added 5.4% to the overall number.

However, retailers in the hardware, paint and glass category saw a 8.3% April decline and detracted 0.7% points from the headline reading.

Investec economist Lara Hodes says:

This category of the market has seen a marked decline as many companies have mandated a return to the office or a hybrid working policy, decreasing demand for DIY and home enhancement related products.

On a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis, retail sales were down 0.2%.

Hodes says: “Many households are still financially stretched in the current economic environment. Unemployment remains at heightened levels, amid a sluggish labour market, while elevated administered and food prices continue to dilute disposable incomes. Moreover, rising interest rates are weighing heavily on the indebted, with the probability of a further 50 basis points rate hike by the Reserve Bank next month.”

Meanwhile, business confidence last month was down to its lowest level in two years. In a statement, the SA Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Sacci) says the business confidence index (BCI) dropped 4.4 index points from 93.7 in April to 89.3 index points last month.

Sacci says the dip in BCI was in line with other economic and financial market data in the second quarter of this year. It added while the general trend in business confidence during the first three months of the year was positive and in harmony with improved economic activity (GDP growth), more negative sentiment in the business climate occurred in April and last month.

The firm operates through its Wholesale and Retail business segments. Its brands include Famous Brandz, RGR, Smoker’s Corner, Canna Cabana, KushBar, and Kush West.

The company recently reported earnings for its second quarter, achieving its ninth straight month of positive adjusted EBITDA at C$2.4 million. Despite this, the stock is down nearly 8% today, as investors don’t seem excited about the earnings report.

Earnings per share came in at -C$0.14, which was below analysts’ consensus estimate of -C$0.07. In the past nine quarters, the company has missed earnings estimates six times.

Nevertheless, High Tide saw strong revenue growth of 98% year-over-year, with revenue hitting C$81 million compared to C$41 million. In addition, same-store sales increased 23% quarter-over-quarter.

However, gross profit only increased 51%, meaning that the company hasn’t demonstrated that it has operating leverage. Indeed, its gross margin has contracted from 37% to 28%. The drop in gross margin was caused by a higher mix of brick-and-mortar revenue.

Investor Sentiment

The sentiment among TipRanks investors is currently very negative. Out of the 532,948 portfolios tracked by TipRanks, 0.2% hold High Tide. However, in the last 30 days, 2% of those holding the stock decreased their positions.

Likewise, 0.5% of TipRanks portfolios decreased their holdings in High Tide in the past seven days. The stock’s sentiment is below the sector average, as demonstrated in the image below:

Analyst Recommendations

High Tide has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on one Buy and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average High Tide price target of C$11.53 implies 323.8% upside potential.

"“American people support me, not you!”: Bernie Sanders confronts Lindsey Graham at Fox News debate","In an Oxford-style debate Monday with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sen. Bernie Sanders argued that progressive policy goals such as Medicare for All, Social Security expansion, and a higher minimum wage are ""what the American people want"" and blasted the political establishment—including his GOP colleague—for ignoring the most important crises facing the United States, from the climate emergency to obscene levels of economic inequality.

""That's what the establishment does, and Lindsey is a very good and effective representation of the establishment,"" Sanders said after Graham delivered his opening remarks of the debate, which was held at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute in Boston and streamed live by Fox Nation. ""Does Lindsey have a concern that we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people? That some 60,000 people a year die because they don't get to a doctor on time? I didn't hear much about that in that opening statement.""

""Does Lindsey care that we have the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and that the pharmaceutical industry right now has 1,500 paid lobbyists in Washington, D.C. to make sure that in some cases we pay 10 times more for the medicine that we need?"" Sanders asked. ""Did Lindsey talk about the fact that we have, in South Carolina and all over this country, tens of millions of workers working for starvation wages? Did he talk about a corrupt political system in which billionaires today can start a super PAC—and I guess you have some familiarity with super PACs, they help fund your campaign—who can spend unlimited amounts of money to elect candidates.""

""I didn't hear Lindsey talk about the crisis of climate change,"" the Vermont senator continued. ""Do you have a concern that two people own more wealth than the bottom 42%? ... Bottom line is: we are moving toward oligarchy. And if we don't stand up and say that we need a government that represents working people and the middle class, I worry very much about the future of this country.""

Watch:

Sanders, who has appeared on Fox News several times in recent years to counter right-wing narratives and make the case for a progressive agenda, did so again during Monday's event, forcefully dismissing Graham's attempt to cast basic and popular policy objectives as ""full-on socialism"" and detached from public sentiment.

""The policies that I advocate are taking place all over the world,"" countered Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist. ""I would like to ask Senator Graham: Do you think raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is socialistic? Do you think doing what every other major country on Earth does—guaranteeing healthcare to all people—is socialistic? Do you think expanding Medicare to cover dental care is quite socialistic?""

""I think we should increase benefits for Social Security recipients by lifting the cap... is that socialistic?"" he continued. ""Is making sure that all of our kids are able to get a higher education, is that socialistic? Is saying that three Wall Street companies should not control $20 trillion in assets, and we gotta break them up, is that socialistic?... Take a look at the issues we are fighting for: on every one of those issues, Lindsey, guess what, the American people support me, not you.""",,[],[]
"After bushfires and floods, will Australians step up and vote for climate action?","In just two days, Australian voters go to the polls to vote for their next government - but will they prioritise climate leadership or their economic reliance on fossil fuels?

Australia is one of the world’s worst offenders for carbon emissions per capita. The country is responsible for 1 per cent of greenhouse gases, a figure that rises to 3.6 per cent with their fossil fuel exports factored in. For a nation with only 0.3 per cent of the world’s population, this is a massive amount; nearly three times the average for other G20 countries.

The consequences of their carbon-intensive industries are right on their door step., This year ‘once in a generation’ (hopefully) floods occurred in eastern Australia, and who could forget the ‘black summer’ of 2020 which saw wildfires ravage the countryside and darken the skies of Sydney.

Given the disjuncture between the government’s approach to emissions and the very real dangers faced by the Australian population, it’s no surprise that voters are concerned.

A majority in parliament’s lower house is needed by one party - or a coalition - to pass legislation. Current Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s Liberal-National coalition has been in power for a decade, with the main opposition party, Labor, vying for control.

Meanwhile, the Green party have seen an uptick in popularity due to increased concern over global heating, and a rag tag group of high-profile challengers to the Liberals, called the Teal Independents, are hoping to make a dent in Morisson’s majority.

However with many swing seats in coal mining areas and a strong fossil fuel lobby, can the country vote in a government that’s progressive on climate? Let’s take a look at what’s at stake.

Morrison came under considerable international pressure for his perceived lack of enthusiasm for COP26 in Glasgow last year. It was only shortly before the major climate conference that Morrison finally announced a commitment to netzero by 2050. He has also drawn ire for the goal of only a 26 - 27 per cent cut by 2030, which would equal half that of the UK and US commitments.

Meanwhile the Labor party is aiming for a 43 per cent cut in the same time frame, contrasting themselves with Morrison’s coalition in taking climate change more seriously. Labor claims this will be consistent with 1.6C - 1.7C increases in temperatures as set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The Greens are unsurprisingly pushing the envelope further and promising a 75% cut in emissions by the end of the decade, with the Teal Independents goal set as 50 - 60%.

Meanwhile the far-right One Nation party are proud climate sceptics and want an end to emissions targets.

It’s widely accepted that high-emitting countries like Australia and those in Europe and North America must cut their emissions by two thirds before 2030 in order to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.

2 - Green infrastructure

Solar power could be a key stone in fighting climate change in Australia American Public Power Association

A shift to netzero means a shift away from power stations and coal, difficult given Australia’s reliance on the dirtiest fossil fuel for 70 per cent of its electricity as well as exports.

However, as President Biden was keen to point out to the American public in 2020, the green transition can mean jobs, jobs, jobs! A sentiment Australian politicians have taken forward as they try to woo swing voters.

In Monash, an agricultural area east of Melbourne, candidates are vying to put forward plans to both slash emissions and stimulate the regional economy.

Labor is focused on establishing a hotbed of hydrogen industry in the area while the Liberal party have highlighted a €1.3 billion spending commitment to renewable energy. Meanwhile an independent candidate has said they will provide investment to boost wind, hydro, and solar power.

Elsewhere on a visit to Newcastle, Morrison pledged €33 million investment to help create jobs and develop world-leading technology in solar, hydrogen, storage and green metals.

Both the Liberal and Labor emissions targets rely heavily on technological solutions like carbon capture and hydrogen, rather than cutting emissions at their source.

3- Coal mines

Coal mining is big business in Australia, providing around one-tenth of gross domestic product and dominating whole regions.

According to the Lowy Institute 55 per cent of Australians want the government’s main priority on energy policy to be reducing carbon emissions. However, the country’s reliance on coal means that 30,000 jobs stand to be lost by eliminating fossil fuels, according to the Centre for Policy Development, creating a difficult bind for politicians.

Neither Labor nor the Liberal-National coalition have pledged to close coal mines, pointing rather to a policy of naturally shifting away from coal as the market demand decreases. Meanwhile, 114 new coal and gas projects are in the government pipeline and if all of these are carried out, the country’s emissions would increase by 250 per cent.

So far the Greens are the only party to pledge to end burning, exporting, and mining of thermal coal by 2030, in line with their pledge to be carbon neutral by 2035.

6 - The Pacific

Shock greeted a recent revelation that China has signed a security deal with the Solomon Islands, with the opposition Labor party accusing Prime Minister Scott Morrison of dropping the ball on Australia’s leadership in the Pacific.

Climate change poses an existential threat to the island nations of the Pacific, with low-lying countries like Tuvalu already disappearing due to rising sea-levels, and an increase in cyclones and extreme weather also battering larger nations like Fiji.

Labor has pledged over €350 million in development aid to the Pacific region, with some earmarked for patrolling illegal fishing and helping Pacific nations to tackle climate change, including disaster relief centres.

The plan, which Liberal leader Scott Morisson says builds on existing policy, would also see the creation of a Pacific climate infrastructure financing partnership to support clean energy infrastructure.",,[],[]
"North India’s hills are feeling the heat too, but differently","India recorded the hottest March in 122 years and since then, there has been hardly any relief from heatwave conditions.

To seek relief from severe heat, tens of thousands of tourists either visited or are going to the hill stations in northern India, causing massive traffic jams.

The rush of tourists from plains to hills has highlighted environmental issues plaguing the fragile Himalayas ecosystem such as water shortage and plastic pollution.

Experts say that tourism beyond the carrying capacity of such ecologically sensitive regions could cause irreversibly harm to the fragile ecosystem of these areas.

“No winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn,” says author Hal Borland. But it seems in 2022, spring forgot its annual appointment with northern India as a usually pleasant March was replaced by an unusually hot March, which was the hottest in the last 122 years. In fact, on May 15, Delhi experienced the hottest day of the season with mercury crossing 49 degrees Celsius.

So, while the plains were burning and there was hardly any relief from the scorching sun, tens of thousands of tourists either visited or are planning to go to hill stations in Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. This has caused massive traffic jams and many experts say that tourism beyond the carrying capacity of such ecologically sensitive regions could cause irreversibly harm to the fragile ecosystem of these areas.

Raghu Chowdhary, CEO of Wowidays Hospitality and Tourism Pvt Ltd, said, “We usually count May and June as the peak season for summer holidays booking … but we saw a 200 percent increase in footfalls in March and April 2022 compared to last year.” He cited ‘revenge travel‘ and the early arrival of high temperatures for the skyrocketing demand in travel bookings to the Himalayan states of India.

According to him, the pent-up demand for travel due to COVID-19 restrictions last year changed people’s mindsets. “Now, people are not hesitating in spending money on domestic travel. They are choosing domestic travel over international,” Chowdhary shared.

He informed that Indians, in some instances, are now booking a Mumbai- Srinagar flight for as high as Rs. 50,000, which is more than double the average cost, and are even spending Rs. 500,000-600,000 on a domestic trip. “This wasn’t the case earlier. They don’t even mind travelling in the so-called offseason,” he added.

Chowdhary’s claim is supported by the official numbers released by Jammu and Kashmir Tourism Department. The month of April recorded a footfall of around 413,198 visitors arriving at Srinagar International Airport, with 2,909 flight movements. The first week of May alone saw an inflow of 33,000 tourists. “Kashmir is witnessing a record footfall of tourists this year. We are thrilled to say that after two lean seasons, the valley saw more than 700,000 visitors, the highest in the last thirty years,” said Shaqoor Sheikh, the owner of Srinagar-based Nishat Tours and Travels.

The sharp tourism uptick is not limited to Kashmir alone. Tourist destinations in northern India such as Haridwar, Rishikesh, Shimla, Manali, Mussoorie, Nainital, and Dalhousie are packed with tourists. Hotels and homestays are running close to 100 percent capacity – weeks earlier than the usual peak season of mid-to-late May.

“The total population of Tehri is just 24,000, but we saw more than 100,000 tourists during the Good Friday long weekend,” said Avnish Dimri, a local resident of the Tehri region. According to him, there wasn’t a single room free that weekend, and ever since the heatwave intensified in the plains, the rush to the mountains has increased manifold.

The sharp rise in tourist arrivals is expected to rise further. Search queries and bookings for May-June have grown by 200 percent and 40 percent, respectively, compared to January-March, according to data from leading travel booking platforms and domestic airlines. Local travel authorities and people engaged in the tourism industry share a similar sentiment.

Rishi Raj Singh, the CEO of Kaudia Estate, states, “We are a luxury villa (Rs. 85,000 per night charge) based out of a slightly obscure place in Kanatal (Tehri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand). Yet we are completely sold out until June. We are forced to refuse new bookings. We have never seen this kind of demand.”

Heatwave spiked pilgrimage too

Besides travelling for leisure, the heat has also caused a spike in pilgrims registering for the Char Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand. Harish Gaur, media in charge of the Badrinath-Kedarnath Temple Committee, said, 775,842 pilgrims undertook the Char Dham Yatra, visiting the shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri in Uttarakhand, till May 20. This number is relatively high compared to last year’s number of pilgrims – about 500,000. The number is expected to increase further as the local administration has been asked to be prepared to handle over two million cars in the yatra months (May-October). At the moment, the yatra registrations have already been closed until June 1, 2022.

While the travel industry is happy with the booming travel business, many are worried about the burgeoning problem of over-tourism. “All top hotels in Kashmir are booked till June. Rates have increased by thrice, yet tourists are suffering. The overall service has gone down because the demand is higher than the supply. There is a shortage of hotels, cars, and shikaras,” said travel and tour company owner Sheikh from Kashmir.

Chaman Panwar, a travel and tour operator based out of Delhi, said the taxi demand to Uttarakhand and Himachal has gone up significantly since April 2022. There are no taxis available, and his drivers often complain about long traffic jams that have become a common phenomenon in hills this year. “Earlier traffic jams used to happen during key holiday dates but now getting stuck for 2-3 hours in a 14-15 km jam has become a regular thing for my drivers during the Yatra season,” said Panwar. The rush has led to other issues related to parking, stay and fuel as well.

Amritabh Mukherjee, a tourist from Delhi, said he went to Kasauli with his friends to escape the heat and long weekend holiday crowd. “We deliberately planned our holiday in the week of April 22 to avoid the holiday rush of Good Friday long weekend (April 15-17). But to our surprise, we still got stuck in a two-hour-long traffic jam at 1:30 am on the Delhi-Chandigarh highway. And, traffic wasn’t the only issue, we couldn’t even find a hotel to stay in the main town. So, we had to stay two km before the Kasauli town,” Mukherjee said.

Whether it is Uttarakhand, Kashmir, Himachal or Ladakh, traffic jams seem to have become a constant feature in all the hill stations. Sheetal who works at the Prakriti Resort in Gangotri said the government advertised Char Dham Yatra in a big way but didn’t put systems in place to handle the large crowds.

“We have guests that have booked their yatra since 2020, and they are facing problems in getting registrations for darshan. Tourists are disappointed with the local government’s inability to handle the situation,” she said while informing that prices have shot up, and traffic jams have become a daily routine – Uttarkashi to Gangotri stretch that took 2-3 hours now takes more than 6 hours to cross.

The collapse of the ecosystem in hill stations raises concern

The rush from plains to hills has also added to environmental woes such as damage to the fragile mountainous ecosystem, water shortage and plastic pollution.

“As tourism is a big industry, little or no attention is given to the environmental damage it does. Most people don’t adhere to norms on waste disposal, and so many vehicles coming increases ambient air pollution levels. Even the local hotels and homestays don’t follow the right waste disposal practices. We collect tons of plastic waste from pristine hills every year,” said Avnish Dimri.

Avnish, Shaqoor, and Sheetal all resonate with the same point – waste disposal has become all-pervasive.

In fact, a 2021 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emphasises that going forward. mountain regions will be more prone to glacier lake outburst floods like the Chamoli disaster in Uttarakhand and cloudburst-like rains in Himachal Pradesh. The report states that rising temperature and melting glaciers will also have a severe impact on the global plant and animal species that have been already reeling under the effects of heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and floods.

The 2022 IPCC report further paints a worrying picture. It notes that climate change will increase in all regions in the coming decades, especially in South Asia and there will be an increase in heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons.

Krishna AchutaRao, a climate scientist from the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, who has been researching climate change since the 1990s, told Mongabay-India that “the current heatwave is consistent with what has been predicted under the climate change impact. What India is experiencing currently is due to warming of the earth.”

He warned that the worse is yet to come and said “as the earth warms, you can see more heat extremes happen. And, we will witness heat extremes occurring earlier to the season than we are used to – like this year, March-April witnessed the kind of heat we expect in May-June.”

Sharing the direct correlation between climate change and heatwaves, AchutaRao explained, “Over the last 20-30 years, we have witnessed increasing temperatures and the steady increase in heatwaves – the number of heatwaves, their duration and the intensity has been growing. In 2015, a severe heatwave killed over 2,500 people. Unsurprisingly, the number of heatwaves and heatwave-related mortalities is increasing. Anybody who can’t see the direct link between heat waves extremes and climate change has not followed the science.”

The residents, scientists and the travel community share a similar sentiment that the current state of tourism in the hills of northern India makes things very difficult. A long-term strategy to mitigate the impending disasters of climate change and over-tourism is urgently required.

Continental Resources Stock: Harold Hamm’s Deal Ushers In Oil’s Last Hurrah,"imaginima/E+ via Getty Images

By Breakingviews

Oil’s last hurrah wouldn’t be complete without Harold Hamm planting his flag on some of its mounds of cash. The shale pioneer wants to buy the remaining 17% of Continental Resources (CLR) his family doesn’t already own, valuing the entire firm at some $25 billion. The small premium – and outlook for oil prices in the medium term – means he can be a huge beneficiary of wells pumping cash as fossil fuels’ future wanes.

Companies like Continental, that slice through rock with sand and water to squeeze out oil and gas, have come into the firing line from investors who want to own more climate-friendly companies. Describing his bid in a letter to employees, Hamm said that private markets are a better place for companies like Continental, and there’s something to that sentiment. With U.S. President Joe Biden and others chastising industry executives for their business, it’s going to be hard to both make money and stay out of the limelight as a public firm.

It helps that the math of the deal works solidly in Hamm’s favor. Continental is expected to churn out $5 billion of net operating profit next year, according to Refinitiv. That means minority shareholders, with their 17% stake, have a claim to about $670 million of profit after tax, conservatively assuming they pay a 21% tax rate. That works out to a roughly 15% return, based on the price Hamm is paying.

Hamm may have to increase his offer. Continental shares were trading above the offer price of $70 a share Tuesday morning. Plus the premium is a miserly 9% to Friday’s close. While there’s no assurance oil prices will remain high, the return is nearly twice Continental’s cost of capital, according to Morningstar, leaving plenty of padding. Plus investors in larger firms like Chevron and Exxon Mobil are strongly encouraging oil firms to return cash, rather than invest it in new projects. This restraint supports higher oil prices and benefits firms like Continental.

Exploration and production companies are meant to mint more than $830 billion in free cash flow this year, a 70% increase from last year according to Rystad Energy, even assuming oil prices drop from their current level. Hamm and his wildcatter buddies aren’t going to want investors, authorities, or politicians dictating how they can spend that cash – or keep it for themselves. The best way to have the freedom to make those decisions is outside of the purview of the public market.

"Bonn climate conference: World is ""cooked"" if we carry on with coal, US says","Bonn climate conference: World is ""cooked"" if we carry on with coal, US says By Matt McGrath

Environment correspondent Published 6 June comments Comments

The US envoy on climate change John Kerry has warned that the war in Ukraine must not be used as an excuse to prolong global reliance on coal.

Speaking to the BBC, Mr Kerry criticised a number of large countries for not living up to the promises they made at the COP26 climate summit.

Climate diplomats meet again today in Bonn amid new, energy security worries.

If countries extend their reliance on coal in response to the war, then ""we are cooked,"" Mr Kerry said.

The fragile unity shown in Glasgow last November is likely to be tested in Bonn as countries deal with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the cost of living crisis.

Mr Kerry told the BBC that despite these drawbacks, ""as a world we are still not moving fast enough,"" to rein in the emissions of warming gases that are driving up temperatures.

""We can still win this battle,"" the former senator said, but it will require a ""wholesale elevation of effort by countries all around the world"".

Mr Kerry's call was echoed by a leading Ukrainian scientist who urged delegates to speed up their transition away from fossil fuels.

Dr Svitana Krakovska said oil and gas were the ""enablers of war"".

Today's meeting in Bonn, which will last until the end of next week, is much smaller than COP26 and is mainly a technical negotiation.

It occurs halfway between the big conferences in Glasgow and COP27, to be held in Egypt.

The talks will be carried out by civil servants with limited political input and will review progress on a host of issues agreed in the Glasgow Climate Pact,

So how much progress on climate has been made since COP26

Bluntly, not a lot.

A BBC analysis shows that across a range of issues, very little has been achieved.

The world emerged from Glasgow into an energy crisis sparked by a rapid rise in the price of gas. This has been massively compounded by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and ongoing problems in global supply lines.

Prices for fossil energy have shot up dramatically as governments worry about security of supply.

Governments have also been slow in submitting new carbon cutting plans as they have promised to do by September. The list of laggards includes some very significant countries such as India, and the hosts of COP27, Egypt.

Despite this, there is a belief that political leaders still see climate as a major issue, especially in the light of dramatic heatwaves in India and Pakistan, which were linked to human use of fossil fuels.

The discussions in the former West German capital will tell us if that's true.

""I think we'll see the Bonn talks as a real test for whether political will is just words,"" said Alex Scott from environmental think tank, E3G.

""Or whether there are real genuine commitments to make the changes in policy and in spending plans that are needed to address these issues.""

Will the war in Ukraine influence climate negotiations?

Ukraine and Russia normally send delegates to this event, but it remains to be seen if both countries will participate.

Dr Svitlana Krakovska, who led the Ukrainian delegation at the approval sessions of the recent IPCC reports, says climate isn't a critical issue right now.

But she hopes negotiators will recognise the role fossil fuels are playing in the war, and act with greater haste to transition away from them.

""The cause of this war, the enabler of this war is from oil and gas,"" she told BBC News.

""So this is the point for everybody to just think about this and use this opportunity to stop using so much energy and think about our way of life.""

Is the world really returning to fossil fuels right now?

""The global thing that has happened are these unprecedentedly high fossil fuel prices,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

""That just means that clean energy is extremely competitive economically at the moment.""

Some countries have indeed been increasing their coal production, such as India, where the government has decided to re-open more than 100 coal mines previously considered uneconomical.

But in the first quarter of 2022, India also added 3 gigawatts of solar power capacity.

That's roughly a fifth of the UK's entire solar installation, in just three months.

In Europe, which has tabled plans for a swift move away from Russian energy, many countries are seeking alternative sources of fossil fuels ahead of an anticipated energy crunch this coming winter.

The worry for environmentalists is that some like Germany, are now spending money on long-term fossil infrastructure, such as the recently announced plans for new LNG terminals. This could prolong the use of natural gas and keep emissions high.

What's happening with the really big emitters, China and the US?

The most recent assessment indicates that China, the world's largest emitter, has seen the longest decline in carbon output in at least a decade.

Image source, VCG Image caption, Workers in China install solar panels at a tidal power station - green energy sources are rising rapidly even as coal production increases as well

A review of data carried out for Carbon Brief found emissions had fallen since last summer and were down 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022.

This has happened because of last year's slowdown in the real estate market. It's continued because of the resurgence of Covid-19 and the re-introduction of lockdowns which have stemmed economic activity.

There are other changes taking effect in China - production of electric cars and trucks has doubled in a year to 20% of all new vehicles.

The number of wind turbines and solar farms coming on stream in the first four months of 2022 was up 100% on the record levels installed in 2021.

While coal production has ramped up, on balance, observers believe that China's emissions will fall this year, with implications for the rest of the world.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Oil drilling in the Permian basis in Texas has ramped up as a result of US restrictions on Russian energy imports

""We could actually see less emissions this year because of increased prices for fossil fuels and because China's economy is in a tailspin,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, who carried out the research.

By contrast the US, where President Biden has struggled to get climate legislation on the statute books, has seen another oil boom.

According to analysis from Rystad Energy, flows of crude from the Permian basin are expected to grow by around 1 million barrels per day this year.

The region in West Texas now has higher production than any country apart from Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Where does all this activity leave the 1.5C temperature threshold?

To keep this key goal of the Paris climate agreement alive, carbon emissions need to be slashed essentially in half by 2030.

But recent evidence from the UK Met Office indicates that there's now a fifty-fifty chance of temporarily going past the temperature threshold in the next five years.

Image source, NurPhoto Image caption, A woman seeks some relief from scorching temperatures in India

For many developing countries and small island states, an increase of 1.5C with knock on effects on sea levels poses existential questions.

And they fear that the lack of political focus by richer nations on this core issue is increasing the threat.

""Fundamentally, the war and cost of living must not be used as an excuse to let the 1.5C goal slip out of reach,"" said Ambassador Conrod Hunte, from Antigua and Barbuda, who's the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States in the Bonn talks.

""And adequate, fair climate finance is intrinsic to keeping us on this pathway.""

With war and cost of living crises, are there any hopeful signs of progress in Bonn?

Despite the many problems, participants believe there are some grounds for cautious optimism.

This energy crisis has made discussions about heat pumps and electric vehicles part of the mainstream in a way the COPs have failed to do.

The success of climate-focussed candidates in Australia's recent election indicates that voters may be more attuned to voices who are connecting the global crises to rising temperatures.

The Bonn talks could also be a moment when addressing climate become key to dealing with these other challenges as well.

""There are a number of interlinking crises right now, and it is possible for governments to seize this opening to tackle these crises, and take advantage of the opportunities, and build the kind of co-operation globally that's needed,"" said David Waskow, from the World Resources Institute.",,[],[]
How Climate Change Is Majorly Affecting Global Wheat Supplies,"How Climate Change Is Majorly Affecting Global Wheat Supplies

It's no secret that food items from snack food to meats and vegetables are more expensive these days, but the reasons why have nothing to do with us and everything to do with the world around us. Thanks to global events from wars to climate change and global supply chain issues, it's no wonder that Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio said in October that consumers ""had to get used to higher food prices,"" per the BBC.

And he's not alone. Analysts like the agricultural research firm ED&F Man's head of research Kona Haque are sharing this sentiment. ""Whether it's corn, sugar, coffee, soybeans, palm oil, you name it, all of these basic food commodities have been rising,"" Haque has explained, before adding, ""Poor harvests in Brazil, which is one of the world's biggest agricultural exporters, drought in Russia, reduced planting in the U.S. and stockpiling in China have combined with more expensive fertilizer, energy, and shipping costs to push prices up.:

With all of these reasons causing food prices to rise, it may feel like there is nothing we can do to combat them. But we must first understand these reasons if we are to survive.",,[],['Hope Ngo']
US Farmer Sentiment Dives as Farm Input Costs Skyrocket,"A farmer uses a tractor outside of Sacramneto, Calif on April 18, 2022. (John Fredricks/The Epoch Times)

US Farmer Sentiment Dives as Farm Input Costs Skyrocket

Production costs are expected to grow by at least 30 percent this year, a survey shows, signaling more food inflation ahead

Despite strong commodity prices, farmer sentiment in the United States deteriorated sharply in May as producers are anxious about their farm’s financial health and prospects.

Last month, farmer sentiment dropped to its lowest level since April 2020, down 22 points, according to the Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer sentiment index.

The rapid rise in production costs and uncertainty regarding the direction of input prices have been important contributors to the drop in sentiment. About 44 percent of farmers, according to the monthly survey, cited input costs as their biggest concern for the coming year.

Nearly six out of ten farmers predict farm input prices to be at least 30 percent higher this year compared to 2021.

The increase in input prices has been substantially larger than the general inflation seen in farm products so far, according to Michael Langemeier, professor at the department of agricultural economics at Purdue University and co-author of the AG Economy Barometer report.

That’s why farmers “certainly think that general inflation is going to persist for the next 12 months,” Langemeier told The Epoch Times.

On top of this year’s massive price hikes, nearly four out of 10 farmers estimate input prices to rise by 10 percent or more in 2023, according to the survey.

The two most important farming inputs are diesel and fertilizer. Prices of both have risen significantly in the last year and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has further disrupted both markets. Hence, farmers are not expecting price relief anytime soon, according to Langemeier.

U.S. farmers are highly concerned about the possibility of experiencing a price-cost squeeze in the coming years, which refers to the situation in which costs remain high while output prices decrease.

Farmers presently have a strong balance sheet, Langemeier noted, but “they could be facing a price-cost squeeze, particularly in 2023,” he said.

The university conducted the survey with 400 agricultural producers from around the nation, who are typically small farms, sole proprietors or partnerships, or small family-owned businesses.

About 21 percent of respondents cited climate, environment, and farm policies as their biggest concerns, according to the survey. Some farmers also cited the availability of inputs (19 percent) and lower crop or livestock prices (18 percent) as top concerns.

Land Values Soar

Despite the negative sentiment, there’s a lot of optimism when it comes to the value of farmlands.

“The contrast between farmers’ relatively optimistic view of farmland values and their expectations for weak farm financial performance continues to be a bit of a puzzle,” according to the survey report.

Respondents who anticipate an increase in farmland values over the next five years regularly cite non-farm investor demand as the leading factor, followed by inflation.

In recent years, billionaires, global firms, and investment funds have been aggressively purchasing farmlands. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, for example, has quietly amassed approximately 270,000 acres of farmland across the United States, according to media reports.

Langemeier believes there are numerous reasons for the high demand for investment in farmlands, one of which is that “farmland returns are not correlated with stock returns,” making them attractive assets.

It’s especially intriguing for investment funds, he noted, because they’re similar to dividend-paying stocks in that they get a cash rent every year as well as the possibility of land appreciation.

“The return on farmland has been pretty good over a long period of time,” Langemeier added.

The survey, however, revealed a worrying trend in capital expenditures, which has the potential to reduce agricultural productivity in coming years.

Despite having high cash flow, the vast majority of farmers (78 percent) believe it is a bad time to invest in things like machinery and buildings. Supply chain disruptions have impacted machinery purchase plans in particular. According to the survey, low farm machinery inventory levels have pushed up prices, making investment less appealing for farmers this year.

Wheat prices, up 60 percent over the last year, present an opportunity for American farmers. The invasion of Ukraine has threatened the global wheat supply in recent months and many experts have warned that the shortage might trigger a global food crisis.

Part of the issue with all agricultural commodities is that farmers only produce one crop per year, according to Langemeier, making it difficult for American producers to swiftly react to rising prices.

However, he believes farmers will plant more wheat this fall in response to the increased prices.",,[],['Emel Akan']
The future of summer camp: Florida 4-H makes upgrades for sustainability,"The future of summer camp: Florida 4-H makes upgrades for sustainability

With the beginning of 4-H summer camp season, the statewide youth development program is advancing several new initiatives to support long-term sustainability of 4-H camps in Florida.

“4-H camping has been around for almost 100 years in Florida and has helped hundreds of thousands of youth, if not more, learn by doing and gain a sense of independence. These next steps will help ensure more youth continue to enjoy and benefit from the camp experience and have opportunities to learn about Florida’s environment and agriculture,” said Michael Gutter, associate dean for UF/IFAS Extension and state program leader for 4-H.

Florida 4-H operates three camps in the state: Camp Timpoochee in Niceville, Camp Cherry Lake in Madison and Camp Cloverleaf in Lake Placid.

New 4-H camp program initiatives include:

Increased investment in camp infrastructure and staff. To ensure financial sustainability, philanthropic partnership opportunities will be identified at various levels. Camp fees will increase to align with national averages, and financial aid opportunities for youth will increase as well.

Open and flexible registration. Campers will not need to be 4-H members to attend camp, and they will be able to attend any of the three camps regardless of their home county.

Development of a counselor-in-training program for teenage youth interested in leadership opportunities.

Specialized curriculum for each camp: Camp Timpoochee: Marine science; o Camp Cherry Lake: Agricultural sciences and workforce development; Camp Cloverleaf: Outdoor and environmental education

In addition, all camps will seek American Camp Association accreditation to increase the number of youth served and allow outside organizations to use 4-H camp facilities beyond the summer camping season.

Camps Timpoochee and Cloverleaf

Florida 4-H camps offer many opportunities to teach youth and visitors about Florida’s natural resources and the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills needed to conserve them.

Located on Choctawhatchee Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, Camp Timpoochee offers numerous ways for visitors to engage with marine science. Camp Cloverleaf, which sits on the shores of Lake Francis and is nestled among citrus groves, sprawling oaks and fields, likewise opens the door to many outdoor and environmental education experiences.

The Florida 4-H program plans to take advantage of these camps’ surroundings to offer curriculum tailored to the local environment and natural resources.

Major facility and infrastructure updates at Camp Cherry Lake have already been in the works. In 2021, the camp celebrated the renovation and expansion of the pavilion and classroom, with the pavilion dedicated to and named for Henry and Nell Davis.

This summer kicks off the next multi-year phase of improvements: replacement of most of Camp Cherry Lake’s cabins with climate-controlled lodging with enhanced accessibility.

The new cabins will make stays at the camp more accessible and allow more groups to use the facilities outside the summer camping season. One original cabin will be retained to share with visitors the history of the camp and area.

For many camp alumni, Camp Cherry Lake’s original cabins hold great sentimental value. Because of this, the old cabins are being offered to alumni at no cost, as long as they can transport it to another location. Cabins will be available on a first come, first served basis, and more details will be shared in the next month.

Those interested can also contact Erin Mugge (erin.mugge@ufl.edu).

4-H is the youth development program of the land-grant university system and Cooperative Extension System. The program provides hands-on educational programs and experiences for youth ages 5 to 18 with the objective of developing youth as individuals, and as responsible and productive citizens.

In Florida, 4-H is administered by University of Florida/IFAS Extension and Florida A&M University. Learn more at florida4h.org. If you are interested in investing in the future of 4-H camps, contact Caylin Hilton at grow4H@ifas.ufl.edu.

Marketmind: One investor's rebound is another's bear rally,"Traders work on the floor of the NYSE in New York

A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus.

What a difference a week makes!

With the Dow Jones snapping out of its longest weekly losing streak in nearly a century and scoring its best week since 2020 last Friday, the narrative across stock markets has swiftly moved from meltdown fears to hopes of a rebound.

But there are contrasting expectations at play: some strategists believe the S&P 500's 9% bounce back from its May 20 lows could in fact hide a bear rally, or in other words, a money trap before a deeper spiral lower.

Still, capital is making its way back to the stock market with $20 billion flowing to equity funds last week, the largest inflow in 10 weeks, according to BofA citing latest EPFR data.

Investors puzzled with the direction of travel for equities are equally flummoxed with the U.S. dollar index falling 3% from a two-decade high in mid-May.

Behind that whiff of optimism for stocks and the dollar's rivals are signs that cooling U.S. inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes after the summer.

Money markets have rushed to cut bets about the total interest rate hikes expected in the U.S. this year from over 190 basis points only recently to just over 180 basis points this morning.

In Britain too, despite expectations of 10% inflation, recession signals are forcing a shift, with 120 basis point of rate rises priced until June 2023 against 165 at the start of May.

Of course, big inflation drivers remain and the war in Ukraine could lift energy and grain prices even further as have COVID-19 outbreaks in China the potential to bring more disruption to global supply chains.

This morning's data coming from Europe suggests we may not have passed peak inflation just yet: German import prices surged 31.7% in April, the strongest increase since September 1974.

'Highest emitters' asked to do more to combat climate change,"Federal Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman has said the developed world is the highest emitter of greenhouse gases, and should do more to reduce emissions instead of pressing the countries most at risk.

She made these remarks at “The Future of Democracy” discussion during the annual meeting of global leaders at the World Economic Forum 2022 in Davos.

In the context of pressing global agendas that need to be addressed with equity and justice, she talked of the global climate change issue as a joint but proportionate responsibility for the big emitters of the previous and current century.

“We are sitting in the antechamber of climate catastrophe. It is highly unfortunate that our leaders’ vested interests have overshadowed the real changes needed in the world,"" she added.

""Transitions from fossil fuels are the need of the hour but the developed world is still the highest emitter of greenhouse gases, putting their short-term national stakes and corporate interests above the safety and survival of our world. Instead of pressing the countries most at risk, the big emitters should act responsibly and do more.""

""Perhaps then all of us will be better motivated to act faster to build a more sustainable and resilient future. At the same time, no democracy, even a climate-vulnerable one like Pakistan can afford to sit back and not act for their own community. The costs of inaction are too high.""

Rights of vulnerable

The discourse focused on the need for democratic values to safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable. In addition, it explained how democracies are equipped for meeting challenges from authoritarian leaders, especially for complex societies.

While raising the issue of gross inequality between the developed and underdeveloped world, Sherry stressed, “There is little recognition of the persistently growing inequality throughout the world.""

""There is a dangerous chasm between the Global South and the West. The response of the developed world to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, for instance, was timely and clear,"" she said as she compared that to the humanitarian crisis in the developing world.

""...in Afghanistan or after the invasion of Iraq or otherised “browner” cultures, and these have been somewhat alienating, given that we worked from assumptions of liberal democracy that say a response to any humanitarian crisis should be the same, equal for everyone. Unfortunately, that has never been the case, depending on who the victim is or what is the colour of their skin.”

Read Climate change boosted odds of recent deadly heat in India, Pakistan, scientists say

On the importance of democracy for countries like Pakistan, she opined, “Authoritarian systems might appear like they are addressing issues but for complex, heterogeneous countries like Pakistan where many different ethnicities and languages compete with each other, the only way the vulnerable get protected is through a more inclusive approach.""

""Democracies ultimately challenge the system to include the vulnerable, whereas authoritarian governments mobilise populism and sentiment for channelling power, but provide no answers to real problems,"" she said, adding that, ""The developed world has often found authoritarian governments in fragile countries convenient funnels for diplomatic and other interchanges. These are inconvenient truths. Democracies are like women in the world; two steps back and one forward, but they are the only way forward for the disempowered.""

She said democracy cannot be reduced to one linear experience or model in history. “Democracies are inherently not linear in their experience, and countries experience democracy quite differently from each other. No one-size-fits-all theory works in this context. Therefore, it is high time that we move away from this notion that there is one set pattern for democracy or that all parliaments work in the same fashion. The idea should be to have tolerance for the models we all navigate or manage as long as they are in the struggle to be representative and inclusive.”

The climate crisis is a health crisis,"Post-industrial and neo-technological societies have rigorously separated the stories of cultural values and those of the earth’s nature and climate. Human civilizations have been fully dependent on the wilderness of nature and the particularities of climate for their survival and success for millennia. It is understandable that this decoupling in the 20’th century was inevitably perceived as a desirable outcome. For some years now these two stories are coming together once again meshed by the increased unpredictability and volatility of extreme climate events and their recorded and proven impacts on society at large. They are coming together at a time of repeated signs of perceived and real social and economic fragility, which if not absorbed and equitably remediated may trigger systemic changes. Many complex constructs are used to define systemic change. Among them are some traditional ones of economic shock and of increased volatilities in financial markets. More tangible and physical constructs appeal to unique economic issue such as of the widening gap in insurance coverage. Most recently some modern constructs of climate inequality bring together the stories of nature and social issues on the same conceptual and policy plane. All of these constructs and stories contain an element of social fragility. These formalized concepts are part of a language, which is built to abstract from reality and to adapt to academic, scientific and policy research and its consecutive conversations. Yet, these are not only theoretical constructs, but also tangible stories describing social catastrophes already experienced in recent historical realities. The misfortunes of climate change, pandemic and armed conflict emphasize the fragility of our modern society. These experiences of stress, destruction and loss have vividly erased the distinction between the economic and political impact of natural, health and man-made catastrophes and the sheer human disaster and suffering. They have also raised the need for an immediate examination of the sustainability and legitimacy of many current cultural norms. This process of examination is intended to lead to a proposition that for a cultural norm to be legitimate it must be found socially sustainable and socially resilient. The resilience of a social system becomes a requirement for its own legitimacy. It is well understood and accepted that a social order must protect the life, property and essential liberties of the people who belong to it to be found legitimate. The cultural definition of social resilience and sustainability may vary to some degree across geographical regions and political systems but there is some broad consensus. There is even less divergence in understanding that social resilience in itself becomes the indispensable foundation for systemic legitimacy.

Social resilience for the purpose of this analysis is defined as the ability of a society to adapt and absorb large shocks and externalities caused by excess climate volatility and unpredictability. In general resilience is achieved through preparation for extreme, highly unfavorable, and catastrophic outcomes oftentimes cascading through all nodes of the systemic structure. Systemic architects build tiers of reserves and pockets of conserved energy, which are designed to absorb catastrophic shocks. Still systemic reserves and endurance are an exhaustible resource. Once such resources are depleted, catastrophic shocks through a process of network contagion may have deep cascading effects into social and economic layers, previously considered riskless. Such impacts may lead to systemic collapse and full or partial reorganization of many systemic nodes and layers. The processes of collapse and reorganization may be gradual and of evolutionary nature, but it may also be of a sudden and catastrophic nature. In both cases social resilience towards environmental and climate shocks and catastrophes can never be infinite. Remediating the impacts of climate and natural disasters in an equitable manner becomes a common measure of societal endurance. The various degrees of this systemic ability to provide equitable remediation and then recovery from a catastrophic shock have become a comparative metric of systemic resilience. Systemic stability thus becomes a measure of the veracity of social and political systems. Once systemic and social resilience is brought into macro-economic and macro-financial policy discussions, there grows a need for providing a transition and mapping in definitions and measures. This is not a transition and remapping of exclusively and purely technical definitions. This transition is also about a redefinition of a cultural measure – being a measure of value, which must be associated with the legitimacy of current economic and political enterprises. Furthermore, this transition must be about providing information and a degree of evaluation of the durability and longevity of its underlining social establishment. A cultural measure thus must contain valued societal information. This transition is also required to both stimulate and defend the need for a revision of cultural values in such manner that they unquestionably enhance systemic legitimacy. This new dominion of cultural values must contribute to systemic sustainability and thus must have systemic resilience at its core to be legitimate.

The process of economic globalization at a time of lower climate predictability, at a time of growing volatility in extreme natural catastrophes provides this very ground necessary to intertwine the stories of nature and social values. These premises allow an examination of a twofold need for both redefinition of values and for reclaimed systemic legitimacy. The foundations of the current version of the global economy can be traced back to about forty years. The first phase of globalization is about economic growth and accumulation of wealth. It is about the advancement of technological knowledge and building of interconnectivity among regional and national financial, trade and economic systems. These were years of continuous economic growth. They fostered the progress of the established model and the acceptance of its very outcomes. The economic statistics of the period were convincingly reinforcing the intellectual and technical analysis. Absolute and per capita gross domestic product metrics were rapidly raising. The proverbial tide was lifting all boats – big and small. GDP growth as a measure of the economic effectiveness of the system assumed unlimited and boundaryless resources. This economic success blunted our intuition accumulated from historical experience and our historical cognition gained from studying natural sciences and mathematics. These exact sciences have always maintained that every physical system and every physical process have boundary conditions and limitations. Once these boundary conditions are breached, otherwise and previously stable systems and processes collapse or may perform in chaotic and shockingly unrecognizable manner. From first principles of system’s theory, it is established that breaking through one boundary condition may be sufficient to shock a system and throw it into a state of chaos or collapse. In the last two decades we have broken through three such boundaries of stability – these of efficient markets, of the resilience of global health, and of the predictability of the earth’s climate as a vital natural resource. The breach and exhaustion of these limits reveals previously hidden costs of our economic model at a time of disruption and instability. At present there is no recognizable political system, which can survive, let alone succeed without economic growth being its primary objective. Furthermore, for three centuries, since the onset of the industrial revolutions, the expansion and intensity of our drive towards growth and wealth rendered to second order the values of environmental protection and maintaining the stability and predictability of the earth’s climate.

In this inevitable entanglement of risk factors, cultural values and measures of systemic legitimacy, there is a critical component, which is rarely discussed. This is the impact of moral hazard. The scenario of its emergence has been experienced previously in other settings and can be foreseen with certainty. The measurements of disaster and shock in health and economic systems and their contagion effects upon social fragility have been observed and presented to the public discourse. Counter measures of remediation are also defined and refined. Both types of measures are examined and validated by technical and political authorities and thus may become reflected in established policy. During this process there is an element of moral hazard of such policy innovation being implemented only in physical, statistical, economic and health metrics but not yet becoming deeply embedded in cultural values, that are well accepted in society. It is still by no means necessary that this process of exploration, investigation, and policy definition in itself will lead to a transition in cultural values. There is no mandatory social provision or entity that requires this transition to take place or makes it inevitable. Such a transition to a new set of cultural values cannot be mandated. It cannot be enforced. If moral hazard is allowed to become the preponderant ethical concern in the process of value transition, itself accelerated by rapid systemic change, then systemic legitimacy will be endangered. Thus, the only mechanism which remains to facilitate a transition to a new set of moral values is a widely accepted necessity at all societal levels to ensure the survival of systemic legitimacy.

The development of the global economic system is one process where an emerging transition and mapping of new cultural values may express itself for observation. A transition and remapping of value must then overwhelm all other considerations to become embedded in the values representing the second phase of globalization. The only intellectual force which is capable of accomplishing this drive is the search for systemic survival and legitimacy. By this logic the second phase of globalization should establish itself to be about managing common and existential threats from natural catastrophes and extreme climate events as much as it would be about economic growth and wealth accumulation. A new global economic system is thus deemed timely for design. This one must balance twin objectives – growth and wealth creation on one side with sustainability and preservation of natural, human and climate resources on the other. The importance of balance among these two objectives is undisputable. However, the instruments of balance are far from being yet available. The current economic model is fully and well equipped with all the instruments and techniques of causing a profound disbalance. To pursue the objective of economic growth and accumulation of wealth tools and frameworks refined over hundreds and in many cases over thousands of years are well established. These are goods, commodities and financial markets with their domestic and international trade agreements and their investment and growth policies. The mastery of economic growth presents a danger of allowing self-deception to grow in society of its mastery over nature. The lessons learned every day from climate science reveal elemental forces that can bring about a redefinition of the path of civilization. These same earth and physical sciences show society with every newly compiled scientific report that the story of growing climate unpredictability and its adverse outcome of extreme catastrophic events is also a human story. Balance rather than mastery should be the only sustainable and legitimate principle in the further development and unfolding of this story. To pursue a balance with a new set of values, which center on preserving natural and climate resources, at present society is inadequately, and better still, quite ill equipped for the task. We are unequally equipped to pursue balance and hence the most likely outcome is disbalance and inequality of outcomes. The hard task has become not whether and when but how to find with urgency a new set of moral values which will underwrite this story of balance and stability.

Our current civilization and its economic model have honed and perfected instruments and processes for economic growth for many years. This drive to succeed economically to accumulate wealth has become genetically engrained in many who subscribe to the values of contemporary civilization. It has become a part of the human story. So far this has been a tremendously positive story of our civilization. Now a time has come, where a natural resource upon which this drive depends so thoroughly and unequivocally, namely the predictability of earth’s climate, has run short of its previously unquestioned stability. There are no social preparations for this turn of things. A comparison is highly illustrative between the enormous accumulation of tools, treaties, international and state structures on trade, development, and investment to what we have to manage and balance a newly defined instability. The modern pace of knowledge creation and technological development allows states, societies in general, to quickly build a comparable machinery of institutions, treaties, and processes for managing this risk, and to ensure sustainability and predictability of this natural resource of earth’s climate. This can be done in a relatively short period of time.

The essence of these two human activities – the pursuit of economic growth and the preservation of a fundamental natural resource, defined as the stability and predictability of climate can no longer be mutually exclusive. Societies have trained themselves to succeed in the former for many generations and yet they are only in the first generation to face the need to be equally effective in the latter. The time of a single generation must be sufficient to raise a civilization to the magnitude of this task. This amounts to a shift in cultural values. The definition of economic success must and will continue to encompass growth and wealth accumulation. An updated and modern definition must balance these with environmental sustainability, personal and public health, and general well-being. Market and economic stability and success are no longer sufficient to define systemic success. This transition of values must hold true at the level of the corporation, the public sector, an administrative region and even the sovereign state and the international institution. The interconnections between the lack of climate predictability, excess climate volatility and the emergence of new frameworks of values in economic and political activity are not straightforward and linear. Herein the technical definition and social perceptions of the concept of systemic stability are changing. The new and emerging technical definition implies moral sentiment. Work aimed at accomplishing the definition of systemic success is a work to gain ownership of the present and the future. The criteria of systemic stability now become a set of shared values and shared technical definitions. While technical definitions are much easier to change values alter through a much slower process of evolution, transition, and remapping. Organizations, regions, states which can provide this desired stability will be defined and accepted as successful both in economic and social terms. The alternative will be considered systemic failures. If an institution cannot be the source of its own stability and sustainability, then it is by all laws of nature and economics a failed entity.

The mechanics of markets, trade, and investment work without the intervention of a hegemon. Nonetheless they tend to have self-correction and recovery memories and capabilities and thus provide their own state of stability. However, at present, both cultural traditions and market frameworks are missing a moral sentiment needed for fostering sustainability and recovery of a natural resource as vital as climate stability and predictability. Only until recently, this resource was deemed to be boundless. The transition and remapping of values will require that now this resource is seen as a basic tenet of the legitimacy of social cultures. In a broader perspective it is evident that climate issues are local, institutional, and individual and they impact communities and organizations differently. Thus, for a transition to a new set of cultural values to take place the work and preparations needs to take priority. The lack of a globally accepted framework and a hegemonic plan of action with an existing philosophical current deeply vested in resolving these challenges emphasizes the need for collaboration. Resolving and managing a global crisis of an essential natural resource without core and periphery, without clearly defined geographical and social hierarchies is a collaborative effort of the largest possible scale. A framework of collaboration will withstand the pressures of chaotic action born from the lack of rigid contractual frameworks. This collaboration is vitally needed at all systemic levels – the state and region, the corporation, university, and the non-governmental, civic, and military institutions.

In a new regime of torrential change in a global system lacking a pronounced hegemon, agreement is unsurprisingly hard on who should bear the cost of action. In such a circumstance there simply cannot be an authoritative prescription of who should define the mitigation of risk and its consequences. On the level of cultural and social values there cannot be an authority which demands the right and the obligation to change a person’s or a social group’s way of life. Hence it is essential to treat global climate risk as a unifying concept of common human heritage. The concept must be allowed to evolve into an item of collaboration and to allow various degrees of its adoption. Out of this collaborative effort climate and health stability fostering services would be generated and simultaneously would become sources of newly created economic and social wealth. This new kind of wealth creation is driven by both the self-interest of all actors, and by the process of collaboration and collective understanding of the vital challenges at hand. Systemic stability, which includes climate and health factors relies for its success and endurance on this accumulation of self-interest and collective interest. At the human level this is an opportunity to connect the story of society and its desire for growth and its hidden pitfalls with the story of the tremendous power of the earth’s nature and its climate. Particularly in the advanced post-industrial and neo-technological societies these stories have been kept far apart for far too long. The excess volatility of climate, the accumulation of knowledge on the impacts of climate’s unpredictability are creating a societal opportunity to rethink these two stories. We must weave them together again, as our ancestors have always done this in the past.",,[],"['Srilata Kammila', 'Vidhi Bubna', 'Ivelin M. Zvezdov', 'Dr. Arshad M. Khan']"
How Rising Temperatures Affect Ocean Predation,"ABOVE: Experiments suspended from a dock in Bocas del Toro, Panama. The panel in the background is caged from predation, while predators can access the panel in the foreground from below. Smithsonian Institution

Across 115 degrees of latitude, spanning most of North and South America, higher ocean temperatures correlate with more intense predation by fish and shifts in invertebrate prey communities, according to a study published today (June 9) in Science. The results demonstrate one way that warmer ocean temperatures caused by climate change could affect marine ecosystems.

Few studies have looked at both predation intensity and effects on prey communities, and none have done so over such a large geographic scale, says Gail Ashton, a study coauthor and marine biologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. “Applying [this analysis] over such a large geography range is a massive step in our knowledge and understanding,” she says, adding that “the only way we were able to do this is through a massive collaboration.”

The study involved researchers at 57 institutions and took place at 36 nearshore sites in 11 countries along both coasts of North and South America. During the summer months, researchers at each site conducted three experiments. In the first, the researchers measured predation intensity by observing how much dry squid bait predators—mainly fish—consumed in an hour. In the second experiment, they submerged PVC panels below floating docks, half of which were caged to block access by fish larger than 1 cm, and assessed invertebrate community development on the panels over a three-month period. In the third experiment, they assessed how predation affected already-developed invertebrate communities by uncaging half of a group of panels after they’d been kept underwater for 10 weeks.

The results showed that both predation intensity—measured as bait loss over one hour—and loss of invertebrate biomass on uncaged versus caged panels increased in warmer water temperatures. From high latitudes with mean summer water temperatures of 9°C down to tropical latitudes where water temperatures were 31°C, average bait consumption by predators increased from 0 to more than 10 percent. Across the same temperature range, the average difference in biomass between caged and uncaged panels went from close to 0 to more than 300 grams. “It’s significant that we found the kind of universal trend over such a large range of latitudes,” Ashton says.

She says that the near-zero difference in biomass between uncaged and caged prey communities at higher latitudes indicate that predators are not currently the most important factor affecting invertebrate communities in these areas. “I was surprised at the lack of effect at the higher latitudes,” she says. “I expected a smaller effect, but not quite as insignificant as we found.”

Jay Stachowicz, a marine ecologist at University of California, Davis, says the scope of the research is impressive. Stachowicz did not participate in the study but has collaborated with several of its coauthors, including one who was previously a graduate student in his lab.

“Through studies like this, we can start to get a global picture and try to develop something like a map of processes,” he says, adding that scientists have information on variables such as temperature and salinity distribution, but they lack data on how predation varies geographically, which he says is just as important: “There’s shockingly little large-scale understanding of that distribution.”

However, Stachowicz notes that floating panels off of docks in the experiments excluded the effects of predators on the seafloor. “Crabs, snails, other sorts of things aren’t going to ever reach it. And we know those are pretty important predators in these communities,” he says. Ashton says the main reason for not including these predators was that there was too much variation in seafloor habitat types across such a large latitude range; using this method allowed the team to observe a standardized habitat.

Stachowicz says he’d like to see future research identify the mechanisms behind the increase in predation in warmer waters. “To what extent is it that there are more predators? To what extent is it that they’re more metabolically active? To what extent is it that they’re different species? Is it all of those things?” he wonders.

Ashton expresses a similar sentiment, saying, “It would be very cool to have a better idea of who the key predators are in each system.” Understanding variations in predator and prey species as well as environmental factors other than temperature could help explain some of the regional differences they saw, such as stronger impacts on prey in the North Atlantic and South Pacific, the authors write in the study.

A better understanding of how predation may shift as a result of climate change and increasing ocean temperatures could help ecologists pinpoint less harmful areas to fish in or help them identify specific conservation strategies that would be effective in marine protection areas, Ashton says. However, there is much yet to learn, she says.

More broadly, the study “tells us something about what might happen in the future with climate change,” Ashton says, but “it doesn’t tell us exactly how or what might change—it’s a piece of the very complex puzzle of how communities form and how they may change in the future.”",,[],['Full Profile.']

"Research briefs: Sustainability and fast-fashion, seasonality of air pollution and women leaders under the media spotlight","Lack of environmental awareness and preference for variety leading causes of waste in fast-fashion production

Can fast-fashion be sustainable? Researchers, including Javad Nasiry, Associate Professor at McGill’s Desautels Faculty of Management, think yes. By identifying why the fast fashion business model creates waste and whether regulators can establish incentives for consumers and manufacturers are steps to reducing waste.

Recently, the apparel industry has come under scrutiny for creating a waste problem with dire environmental consequences. In the absence of economically and economically viable recycling options, fast-fashion manufacturers pump out low-quality clothes produced in high volumes that are worn only a few times and then discarded – with little to no consequences to manufacturers.

The researchers put forth policy contributions, ranging from sustainable disposal of leftover inventory to production tax to incentivize both manufacturers and consumers to be more waste conscious.

“In order to devise effective policies to curb the environmental impact of the apparel industry, it is important to identify the source of the problem in the supply chain,” explains Professor Nasiry. “Manufactures, consumers, and regulatory bodies can then take an informed approach to recognize the environmental impact of fast fashion and to design an ecosystem to reduce waste, incentivize innovation, and create new business models to manage waste.”

“Sustainability in the Fast Fashion Industry” by Xiaoyang Long and Javad Nasiry was published in Manufacturing & Service Operations Management.

Air pollution gets worse during winter at airports

Air pollution kills approximately 7 million people every year worldwide. According to researchers from McGill University, airports are hotspots for airborne pollutants that are detrimental to human health and the Earth’s climate. Studying air pollution at three major Canadian airports the researchers found that airports situated in colder climates accumulated more pollutants like PM2.5 in the fall and winter, compared to airports in milder climates. The smallest and the coldest airport with the least number of flights and passengers had the highest PM2.5 concentration.

“Meteorological factors such as the cold temperature and snowfall concentrate pollutants and alter their distribution. Targeted reduction of PM2.5 emissions is recommended, especially for cold climate regions where we observe higher concentrations of pollutants,” says Professor Parisa Ariya of the Departments of Chemistry and Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, the researchers found that concentrations of PM2.5 and other particles in residential areas close to one airport decreased to such an extent that it conformed to the recommended workplace health threshold. Before the lockdown it exceeded this threshold. “The drop in the concentration of pollutants due to COVID-19 reveals how much pollution is generated at airports during normal activities. It also shows how much pollution workers and residents of the area are exposed to, especially during cold seasons,” says Professor Ariya.

Gender gap: Women leaders face more scrutiny than male counterparts

More than ever before, women are reaching new heights in various fields. However, success comes at a cost – one that could have significant repercussions on their careers and personal lives.

A recent McGill-led study on the relationship between gender, fame, and media coverage examined how journalists cover women when they break through the glass ceiling, reaching positions of power and status. The researchers examined millions of media references to thousands of women and men in various domains, including politics, business, entertainment, and sports. They showed that although overall media coverage is more positive for women than for men, this difference disappears and even reverses at higher levels of fame.

This phenomenon, referred to as a “paper cut” (in reference to breaking the glass ceiling), results from the violation of gender hierarchies and social expectations about typical feminine behavior, which evokes disproportionate scrutiny for successful women.

“As women become more successful and famous, their media coverage becomes increasingly more negative, while for men the coverage sentiment remains stable, regardless of their level of fame,” explained McGill professor Eran Shor, Department of Sociology. “As women’s fame increases, rather than celebrating their achievements with favorable coverage, media scrutinize them more closely, ready to find blemishes and faults in their performance.”

“Women Who Break the Glass Ceiling Get a “Paper Cut”: Gender, Fame, and Media Sentiment” by Eran Shor, Arnout van de Rijt and Vivek Kulkarni was published in Social Problems.

We owe it to our children to do more on climate change,"Standing beside new Climate and Energy Minister Chris Bowen last week, former fire chief Greg Mullins laid out his blunt assessment of the 2022 federal election. “It was a climate election,” he said. “Australians have spoken. They’ve seen the disasters. They’re frightened about climate change.”

His assessment is correct. Across much of the state two weeks ago, with the memory of devastating floods in northern NSW still front of mind, voters left damp and mouldy houses and stood in rain to get their chance to vote for more ambitious climate action.

And vote for it they did. The teal independents have swept into parliament on a wave of concern about climate change and inflicted grievous damage upon the Liberal Party in the process, taking six of their seats. The Greens took two as well from the Liberal National Party in Queensland, just for good measure.

The new Labor government has a clear mandate to pursue a goal of 43 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. It claims it can do this through investment in renewable energy, which will also cut power bills and create jobs, mostly in regional areas.",,[],"[""The Herald'S View""]"
"ESG, the acronym in search of a fashion makeover","The bad news for all of that effort is that most Australian consumers still don’t even understand the ESG acronym, with only 30 per cent of 1200 Australians surveyed by SEC Newgate having heard of it and 8 per cent saying they had a good understanding. That’s not surprising given the subjective nature and range of ESG concerns as well as its relatively recent popularity with the investor market.

But plenty of businesses and investors also seem confused by how to account for their corporate performance on this despite the market’s requirement to pay at least lip service, and steadily rising community and employee expectations. Questions on ESG are now a prominent if not dominant feature of analyst calls, for example. The sold-out Australian Financial Review ESG Summit on Wednesday is testament to the change.

Yet the contradictions and vagueness of what ESG means in practice are exemplified by the effects of the war in Ukraine. Demands for corporate carbon reduction, for example, meant many investors shied away from any association with “fossil fuels” on reputation grounds, insisting this makes financial as well as environmental good sense. Yet oil and gas companies have become the latest market stars in terms of investment returns over the past year. And the energy shortages and cost impact on often poorer households hardly fits neatly with the “S” or social aspect of ESG investing. Similarly, the previous ESG disdain for arms manufacturers as an affront to socially responsible or “values” investing cannot be easily squared with the defence of Ukraine.

Little wonder that Larry Fink from global investment manager Blackrock has suddenly added much more nuance to previous messages to investors and shareholders about the superior returns from ESG investing.

The payoff from being considered a good corporate citizen has also led to growing suspicion and examples of “greenwashing” or “virtue signalling”. Last month, German police raided the offices of Deutsche Bank’s asset manager, DWS, after a whistleblower complained its claimed ESG credentials were exaggerated and based more on marketing than anything real. International regulators are trying – with great difficulty – to standardise reliable reporting measures.

Australians are also suspicious of greenwashing and other claims of sustainable or ethical behaviour. That is despite the elevated community expectation that companies should do the right thing by their customers and staff and communities and also invest in a responsible, sustainable fashion. The catch for boards and executives is that most people now take this as a given.

Advertisement

According to Brian Tyson from SEC Newgate, this means they may punish a company if they suspect it is not behaving well or actually doing what it claims. But equally, they won’t reward a company for merely doing what they now expect.

The report calls this “The Great Disconnect”. Eight in 10 Australians believe corporates have the power and influence to make a positive difference but are cynical about claimed results unless they see evidence those actions are genuine, consistent and meaningful.

The result is over 40 per cent of those surveyed don’t trust what companies claim about ESG issues once the term is explained. A further 49 per cent are unsure – which doesn’t suggest companies are getting much consumer cut-through with current efforts.

Perceived failings

But sentiment around particular companies can certainly be affected by advertising and marketing, and increasingly by the ability of social media to draw attention to perceived failings – from lack of diversity to excessive plastic packaging to unhelpful service to allegations of sexual harassment to unethical practices in supply chains. It’s why companies are terrified of “activist” campaigns and relentlessly promote their “sense of purpose” to staff and customers.

Not that consumer response is always logical or coherent. According to the survey, several companies feature on both good and bad lists for perceptions of ESG behaviour, for example. And despite emphasis on sustainability, only 23 per cent say ESG issues are “highly important” in influencing day-to-day purchasing decisions – rating it eight or higher out of 10. That is even if more than half say it is highly important that businesses take such action. But the cost of living heads the list of concerns, although concern about climate change is increasing.

How businesses navigate all this in an era of rising inflation and a falling market is a new challenge. Will ESG need a revamp too?",,[],['Jennifer Hewett']
Climate refugees and the loss of agency,"Climate refugees and the loss of agency Environment editor Hahyun Lee discusses the disenfranchisement of those affected by climate change Photo: Envato Elements

Along the north coast of Papua New Guinea live the Murik people. The Murik were first recorded by the Dutch in 1616 and left relatively alone until their land was colonised and set ablaze by the Germans in World War One, then briefly occupied by the Japanese in World War Two. 1975 saw the independence of Papua New Guinea, and now the Murik people number up to 1,500, spread across five main villages. The Murik live primarily through fishing and commerce, trading not only smoked fish, baskets, tobacco and so on, but even non-material goods like basket designs and dances. They are also among the first to be called climate refugees.

The sea level of Papua New Guinea has risen at a rate more than double the global mean (7mm per year) since 1993, as highlighted in COP23. This will only worsen in the future, with predicted cyclones and rainfalls of greater intensity, higher wind speeds and stronger coastal and inland floods. With the predicted warming of 1.1 °C per year by 2030, the future is not bright for Papua New Guinea, as we expect to see its fisheries and crops destroyed, dislocating even more people.

The story of Papua New Guinea falls in line with a common trend we have been seeing: smaller, marginalised populations in the global South suffering problems not caused by them but by larger economies in the global North. And though we can observe the material consequences of climate change in the lives of the Murik, we must also consider how the local societies and cultures respond to such changes. Do they see this as the potentially species-ending threat that many of us see it as, or do they have a different understanding to ours?

David Lipset, professor of Anthropology at the University of Minnesota, conducted an ethnography on the Murik in the wake of severe coastal erosion from high tides in 2007, looking at the various attitudes of the Murik on these tides and how they relate to the religious beliefs and customs of the population. Lipset grounds the Murik’s attitudes within the history of changing human agency towards nature. Whilst explorers of the past saw nature as an ‘untamed expanse’ upon which humans could assert their mastery (Lipset even argues that the adoption of GMT in 1884 established mastery of time over nature), we are now in a situation where we can no longer control the effects of our own decisions: our mastery supersedes agency.

And so it goes for the Muriks that Lipset talks to. In the ethnography, he notes two main responses to the tides. Among the politicians and upper-middle-class, the common sentiment was one of weakness: the tides are a significant act of nature, and any local efforts will be ineffective, denying agency on their part. Meanwhile, the more local villagers, though still expressing uncertainty and fear, saw the tides as not without precedent and proposed magical solutions. A man from the Wewak town said that these tides, as well as the tides of the past, were events with symbolic and ritualistic meaning, representing a pact with their ancestors. With a gift of food thrown into the ocean and an erected platform for each prior lineage, the water spirits would restore the beaches to their prior beauty.

It is likely no surprise which attitude Sir Michael Somare (Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea) adopted when speaking to the UN about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In requesting the world’s nations to cooperate, Somare tacitly accepted the lack of Papua New Guinea’s local agency in tackling its problems with climate change. This shows a shift in how our society interacts with its environment: changes to the environment can only be achieved on ‘distant, globalised terms’.

It would be easy to dismiss the people of Wewak as they throw food into the ocean in hopes of a magically restored beach. Lipset states ‘Because global risks are understood as incalculable, unlimited, and unaccountable, and their location in space and time is global, rather than territorial, … local agency … become[s] problematic.’. In that case, can we even say there is a more reasonable way to respond to this problem where there cannot be local agency? Are we performing as much of a ritual as the Muriks when we pick up litter or pick the train over the car? Can we really blame them?

Most small firms fear long-term fallout from UK’s cost of living crisis,"Three-quarters of small and medium-sized companies are worried about the long-term impact the cost of living crisis, soaring energy bills and rising inflation will have on their business, a survey has found.

Just over half (51%) of SMEs said they were concerned that rocketing prices would dent consumer spending, in response to Barclays’ SME Barometer, a quarterly survey of business sentiment conducted for the bank.

Rising energy bills and higher raw material costs are putting pressure on businesses and creating a challenging trading environment.

More than a quarter of the 574 firms surveyed said they feared that having to increase their own prices in response would make them less competitive.

A tight labour market is putting further pressure on businesses, they reported, with some struggling to hire new staff. Recently companies across a range of industries, from nurseries to nightclubs, have reported problems finding workers to fill vital roles.

However, the four-day bank holiday weekend for the Queen’s platinum jubilee provided a rare bright spot for SMEs, who said they believed sales would rise during the break.

The late May bank holiday has been moved to 2 June, creating an extended break from then until 5 June, as part of a year of events marking the first time a British monarch has been on the throne for seven decades.

Independent pubs, bars and restaurants are expecting a sales boost worth about £76m during the jubilee celebrations on Thursday and Friday.

Businesses who responded to the Barclaycard survey predicted that the festivities would bump up their revenue. Six in 10 SMEs said they were forecasting 10% higher sales on average between April and June compared with the same quarter a year earlier.

Hospitality and leisure businesses also expect revenues to be a third (35%) higher during the three-month period than in 2021, when they reopened as Covid lockdown restrictions eased.

While some SMEs are positive about their own prospects, nearly half said they were pessimistic about the outlook for the wider UK economy, while two-fifths reported that the current business environment is unstable.

Sentiment around business prospects and stability have both dropped since the first quarter, and were well below the levels recorded early in 2021, despite that being a period when many coronavirus restrictions were still in place.

Businesses’ concerns about the future economic environment follow a successful first quarter of the year, when more than half reported rising sales compared with the final three months of 2021.

These figures are supported by the volume of debit and credit card payments processed to SMEs, which saw a 20% increase in value and a 35% increase in volume between January and March compared with pre-pandemic levels, according to figures from Barclaycard Payments. It said the large growth in spending with SMEs can be partly attributed to the accelerated switch from cash to card payments witnessed during the pandemic.

Colin O’Flaherty, head of SME at Barclaycard Payments, said: “After an exceptionally tough time for the hospitality and leisure sector, it’s encouraging to see that businesses have seen revenues rise over the last few months, despite a challenging economic climate.”

Ross Robinson, owner of The Queens Pub and Hotel in Lytham, which will be holding a Jubilee event, said the extra bank holiday should give the business an opportunity to capitalise on warmer weather and people’s desire to go out.

“We hope the public use this time to support businesses in their local area, to help boost sales during a period where general costs of running a business are at the highest they have been for many years,” he said.",,[],['Joanna Partridge']

Bitcoin and banking’s differing energy narratives are a matter of perspective,"The Carbon Bankroll Report was released on May 17 as a collaboration among the Climate Safe Lending Network, The Outdoor Policy Outfit and Bank FWD. The collaboration made it possible to calculate the emissions generated due to a company’s cash and investments, such as cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

The report revealed that for several large companies, such as Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce, the cash and investments are their largest source of emissions.

The energy consumption of the flagship proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain network, Bitcoin, has been a matter of debate in which the network and its participants, especially miners, are criticized for contributing to an ecosystem that might be worsening climate change. However, recent findings have also brought the carbon impact of traditional investments under the radar.

Bitcoin is often vilified due to “imagery”

The Carbon Bankroll Report was drafted by James Vaccaro, executive director at the Climate Safe Lending Network, and Paul Moinester, executive director and founder of the Outdoor Policy Outfit. Regarding the impact of the report, Jamie Beck Alexander, director of Drawdown Labs, stated:

“Until now, the role that corporate banking practices play in fueling the climate crisis has been murky at its best. This landmark report shines a floodlight. The research and findings contained in this report offer companies a new, massively important opportunity to help shift our financial system away from fossil fuels and deforestation toward climate solutions on a global scale. Companies that are serious about their climate pledges will welcome this breakthrough and move urgently toward tapping this lever for systematic change.”

A few metrics that the report highlighted regarding the climatic impact of the banking industry include:

Since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, 60 of the world’s largest commercial and investment banks have invested $4.6 trillion in the fossil fuel industry.

Banks such as Citi, Wells Fargo and Bank of America have invested $1.2 billion in said industry.

The largest banks and asset managers in the United States have been responsible for financing the equivalent of 1.968 billion tons of carbon dioxide. If the U.S. financial sector were a country, it would be the fifth-largest emitter in the world, just after Russia.

When compared to the direct operational emissions of global financial firms, the emissions generated through investing, lending and underwriting activities are 700 times higher.

Cointelegraph spoke with Cameron Collins, an investment analyst at Viridi Funds — a crypto investment fund manager — about the reasons behind the excessive vilification of the Bitcoin network. He said:

“It’s easy to picture a warehouse of high-performance computers sucking down power, but it’s not so easy to picture the downstream effects of cash in circulation financing carbon-intensive activities. More often than not, it’s this imagery that demonizes Bitcoin mining. In reality, the entire banking system uses more electricity in operations than that of the Bitcoin mining industry.”

In addition to the portrayed “imagery,” there have been various efforts to track the exact energy consumption of operating the Bitcoin network. One of the most widely accepted metrics for this complex variable is calculated by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance and is known as the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI).

At the time of writing, the index estimates that the annualized consumption of energy by the Bitcoin network is 117.71 terawatt-hours (TWh). The CBECI model uses various parameters such as network hash rate, miner fees, mining difficulty, mining equipment efficiency, electricity cost and power usage effectiveness to compute the annualized consumption for the network.

The growth in the number of participants and related activity on the Bitcoin network is evident in the monthly electricity consumption of the network. From January 2017 to May 2022, the monthly electricity consumption has multiplied over 17 times from 0.62 TWh to currently standing at 10.67 TWh. In comparison, companies such as PayPal, Alphabet and Netflix have witnessed their carbon emissions multiplied by 55, 38 and 10 times, respectively.

Collins spoke further about the perception of the Bitcoin network that could be changed in the future. He added that if more people approached Bitcoin (BTC) mining as a financial service as opposed to mining, sentiment surrounding PoW networks might begin to change, and the public may appreciate it more as an essential service as opposed to a reckless gold rush. He also highlighted the role of thought leaders in the community in conveying the true nature of Bitcoin mining to policymakers and the public at large.

Working together to solve the energy problem

Recently, there have been several examples of the Bitcoin mining community collaborating with the energy industry — and vice-versa — to work on methodologies beneficial for both parties. The American Energy company, Crusoe Energy, is repurposing wasted fuel energy to power Bitcoin mining, starting in Oman. The country exports 23% of its total gas production and aims to reduce gas flaring to an absolute zero by 2030.

Even the United States energy giant ExxonMobil couldn’t help but get in on the action. In March this year, it was revealed that Crusoe Energy had inked a deal with ExxonMobil to use excess gas from oil wells in North Dakota to run Bitcoin miners. Traditionally, energy companies resort to a process known as gas flaring to get rid of the excess gas from oil wells.

A report released by the Bitcoin Mining Council in January revealed that the Bitcoin mining industry increased the sustainable energy mix of its consumption by nearly 59% between 2020 and 2021. The Bitcoin Mining Council is a group of 44 Bitcoin mining companies that represent over 50% of the entire network’s mining power.

Cointelegraph spoke to Bryan Routledge, associate professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, about the comparison between the carbon emissions from Bitcoin and traditional banking.

He stated, “Bitcoin (blockchain) is a record-keeping technology. Is there another protocol that would be comparably secure but not as energy costly as PoW? There are certainly lots of people working on that. Similarly, we can compare Bitcoin to record-keeping financial transactions in regular banks.”

The block reward for mining a block of Bitcoin currently stands at 6.25 BTC, over $190,000 as per current prices, and the current average number of transactions per block stands around 1,620 as per data from Blockchain.com. This entails that the average reward of one transaction could be estimated to be over $117, a reasonable reward for a single transaction.

Routledge further added, “Traditional banks are a far larger size and so, in aggregate, have a large impact on the environment. But for many transactions, there is a much lower per-transaction cost — e.g., an ATM fee. BTC has lots of benefits, arguably. But surely becoming more efficient seems an important step.”

Since gauging the true impact of Bitcoin is not really a quantifiable effort due to the significant change that the technology and the currency represent, it is important to remember that the energy consumption of Bitcoin can’t be vilified in an isolated manner. The global financial community often tends to forget the high impact of the current banking system that is not offset by corporate social responsibility and other incentives alone.",,[],['Richard Mason']
Our government must trust the experts,"Share selection to:

With the Australian election looming against the backdrop of global challenges like the ongoing pandemic and the climate crisis, now more than ever we need to ensure that the public policy decisions that are made on our behalf are based on hard evidence and verified facts.

Things become concerning when we hear comments like those of Australian Department of Human Services Secretary, Renee Leon, who in May 2020 said that the Australian Government “is sick of experts… to be an expert is to be reviled for being part of an elite of people”.

Former US President Donald Trump undermined science and scientific institutions. Picture: Gettty Images

There have been similar sentiments expressed internationally by British MP Michael Gove and former POTUS Donald Trump.

High level cabinet ministers have consistently downplayed the role of expertise in shaping public policy, leading to dangerous decisions across the scope of public society. They extend this even further by the funding cuts to research that can inform these very policies, resulting in a ‘brain drain’ that could haunt the country for years to come.

Let’s not forget the consistent anti-lockdown rhetoric from the federal government in 2021.

With state governments in New South Wales and Victoria making efforts to follow the expert health advice, the federal government instead expressed disdain at this approach – one recommended by a vast number of public health policy experts and epidemiologists.

The United Australia Party (UAP), led by MP Craig Kelly, is reportedly spending $A70 million on its election campaign. This is a party strongly critical of conventional treatments of COVID-19, including vaccines, as well as lockdowns and vaccine mandates. All despite expert advice to the contrary.

Some see this as a way of ‘representing the people’ considering the often well attended anti-lockdown rallies held in many of our major cities. You may have even seen some of this anti-expert commentary in your own life – on Facebook, Twitter or at a family lunch.

So, how prevalent is any of this anti-expert sentiment in the general population? And why is trust in experts so important when it comes to democratic decision-making?

Let’s take a look.

The impact of an absence of trust in experts

My latest free open-access research explores, in part, the tension between ‘facts’ and ‘untruths’ which has been utilised in discussion across many issues; from the radiation impacts of wireless internet in our home to the effects of wind generation farms on local health or the safety of nuclear power plants.

Although experts play a critical role in understanding and communicating the risks attached to examples like those above, public discussions which repudiate facts and expert information are rife – something we’ve seen around some public debates on the COVID vaccine.

Many people rely on experts to guide us in our own day-to-day decision-making – should I continue to wear my mask? How safe is my phone? Are my kids safe at school?

These are all risk-based decisions. And risk-based decisions rely on expert knowledge because trust is crucial where knowledge is lacking.



If people don’t trust information from experts, then we instead turn to sources of information we do trust – this can range from the opinions of friends and family, social media or even unverified YouTube clips.

The internet can be a minefield of information that isn’t proven, that’s unverified and unhelpful. Picture: Getty Images

This can be a minefield of information that isn’t proven, that’s unverified and unhelpful.

More importantly, the decisions based on information from sources like this can be harmful to others. For example, believing in and acting on reports like the one that says mask wearing will reduce your oxygen intake (and therefore impacts on your own health) puts others and the community at risk.

All because of a belief in information that is factually incorrect.

A lot can be said about our relationship with this kind of evidence that the very notion of ‘factchecking’ is now a type of media article designed to double-check our politician’s claims or the latest fad touted by an online influencer.

Most genuinely trust experts

Something that may surprise you is that here in Australia, the public are generally a very expert-trusting population.

A number of studies have found that experts are highly trusted, including medical professionals, engineers and scientists.

Not only are these experts trusted, but some become labelled as heroes with fanbases or their work. Think back to 2021 and the T-shirts, bedspreads and tea towels glorifying the Victorian Chief Health Officer, Professor Brett Sutton.

Provincial Health Officer for British Columbia, Dr Bonnie Henry, had fan clubs following her daily COVID briefings. Picture: Getty Images

We’ve seen similar trends in other countries. The US’s leading infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, was recognised by the online trend of Man Crush Mondays and in Canada, the Provincial Health Officer for British Columbia, Dr Bonnie Henry, had fan clubs popping up following her daily COVID briefings.

These examples don’t tell us of a public that is wary of experts, but a public that in fact sits up and takes notice of what they have to say.

Controversies like the implementation of 5G technology, or the construction of nuclear power facilities present key flash point debates where public sentiment has in some instances diverged from expert opinion.

But these examples don’t highlight the widespread distrust of experts, but rather, the effectiveness of democratic practices in steering public policy.

This can also be said for action on climate change.

The worry that many politicians have for the ‘teal independents’ highlights that public sentiment on climate change is a major concern, and therefore can be acted on in our upcoming democratic practice – voting.

Public trust in climate expertise is high, and therefore, democratic decision-making is a way to sway governments toward expert-backed policies and stances.

The looming election is a good opportunity for us to reflect on how public policy is framed, and the evidence it is based upon.

Recognising that we have a public in Australia who is generally trusting of experts, should our government officials not reflect this as well? The Australian government may be sick of experts, but the Australian public sure aren’t.

Democrats set to blow through key date for moving Biden’s agenda,"Democrats are set to blow through the soft Memorial Day deadline for reaching a deal with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on a slimmed-down budget reconciliation bill to raise taxes, fight climate change and lower the cost of prescription drugs.

Senate Democratic sources say there’s no chance of getting a deal this week but they argue that doesn’t necessarily mean the negotiations over a long-awaited budget reconciliation package are doomed.

Some optimistic Democratic aides note that neither Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) nor Manchin has identified the Memorial Day recess as a drop-dead deadline.

Instead, Democrats are once again pushing back the target date for getting a deal with Manchin. They now point to the start of the August recess as the new deadline, arguing that gives them most of August to draft legislation and the month of September to pass it on the floor.

Such a timetable seems difficult, to say the least.

Passing major legislation in September of an election year is extremely difficult, and high inflation has been the main reason for Manchin’s opposition to the package. The nation’s concerns about inflation have only grown in recent weeks.

Pushing the deadline back, however, shows that some Democrats are refusing to publicly throw in the towel on the package. There are a few reasons for this, including the fact that the rules for preventing the GOP from filibustering the package expire at the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30.

“We hear it’s really a Schumer conversation and there’s progress but until we actually see there’s been an agreement and an initial on the agreement and we’re going to put it on the floor, I’m going to be skeptical,” said a Democratic senator, characterizing conversations with fellow Senate Democrats on the state on the negotiations.

The lawmaker said Schumer has taken the lead in the talks because senior White House officials damaged their relationships with Manchin when negotiations broke down in December. Manchin was furious that the White House leaked that he opposed a one-year extension of the expanded child tax credit, a popular provision among many Democratic lawmakers who wanted it to be in the package.

“The administration is not getting it done. Their relationships are too damaged. Only through Schumer is it going to get done but it’s not like it’s easy. I give it a 50-50 possibility of a modest bill getting done,” said the Democratic senator.

Manchin was in Davos, Switzerland, on Monday for the World Economic Forum. Speaking at a panel session with Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Manchin predicted that Congress would be able to pass meaningful legislation by the midterms.

“There’s a responsibility and opportunity we can do something,” he said.

Manchin told reporters last week that all 50 Senate Democrats should be able to agree on a reconciliation package that lowers the price of prescription drugs. He has previously said the package should include proposals to reduce the deficit and fight climate change.

Rank-and-file Democratic senators say they’ve been kept largely in the dark about Schumer’s negotiations with Manchin.

“You’re not going to hear anything, I don’t think, out of anyone but Schumer and Manchin, just the two of them,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.). “I’ve been involved in previous discussions but at this point we’ve really delegated everything to Sen. Schumer in his conversation with Sen. Manchin.”

Cardin said Schumer told colleagues that if there is to be a deal with Manchin, “it needs to be done soon.”

“We thought this work period,” Cardin said, referring to the five-week stretch that ends this Thursday or Friday.

Some Democrats still think Memorial Day is a key date and holding out hope for an agreement, at least in principle, by the end of this week.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who presided over a pro-forma session of the Senate on Monday, said she shared Sen Tim Kaine’s (D-Va.) view that it was important to get a handshake deal by Memorial Day.

“That’s the ideal and that’s what we would like,” she said. “That’s what we would want to have.”

Asked about the chances of passing any kind of reconciliation package, Duckworth said “I think 50-50 right now,” predicting that constituents are going to ramp up pressure on senators to get something done.

“As folks go home and see where the lay of the land is, hopefully that’s going to light a fire under them,” she said.

A group of 26 vulnerable House Democrats led by Rep. Lauren Underwood (Ill.) warned Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in a letter Monday that if Congress doesn’t pass a new round of health insurance subsidies though the budget reconciliation package, constituents will see their premiums go up right before the midterm election.

“We cannot afford to backslide on this progress. Our constituents cannot afford to go back to paying upward of 20 percent — or more — of their household income on health care premiums,” the group warned.

Schumer has kept the number of negotiators small and the talks quiet, a pivot from the fall when Democrats set high expectation for passing Build Back Better by Christmas.

White House chief of staff Ron Klain conceded in January that too much of last year’s negotiations with Manchin played out in public view.

“One lesson we learned in the first year is, I think, the less we talk about our negotiations with specific senators and congressmen, the better we are, so I’m going to say our talks with Sen. Manchin will proceed directly and privately,” Klain told the Wall Street Journal in an interview.

A Democratic strategist who has closely followed the talks predicted there’s no chance of a deal by the weekend.

The strategist said there’s “zero” chance of getting a deal with Manchin the next few weeks but predicted something could get done by the August recess.

The source also said that rumors about a falling out between Manchin and senior White House adviser Steve Ricchetti during last year’s negotiations are overblown.

“Manchin and Steve Ricchetti are fine but I do think there will be fewer people in the room,” the source said.

The sentiment that no deal will emerge in the next few weeks was echoed Monday by Senate Democratic aides.

“It all suggests it’s going nowhere fast,” said one Democratic aide.

Some Democrats, however, think the lack of details from the talks between Schumer and Manchin are a reason to be hopeful. These optimists point out that when two opposing sides in a policy negotiation stay quiet, it’s often a sign they’re resolving disagreements.

“I think it’s a good sign that there’s obviously some talks and it’s very quiet. I think public negotiations have been very damaging to this process. If something’s going to get done, Schumer, Manchin and Biden are going to figure it out. And I wouldn’t even put a timeline on it,” said Jim Kessler, a former Schumer aide who now serves as executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank.",,[],"['Alexander Bolton', 'Hours Ago', 'Day Ago', 'Am Et', 'Days Ago', 'Mins Ago']"
Scarcity and increasingly higher prices for food may mean a windfall for Minnesota’s wheat farmers,"WASHINGTON – Tim Dufault’s harvest has grown wheat on his farm near Crookston for 40 years, but this year is different. A lot is riding on his harvest as shortages and resulting high prices have raised the specter of famine in some parts of the world.

The price of wheat has soared, from an average of $6.82 a bushel last June to about $10.71 a bushel today. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts wheat prices will continue to rise. So Dufault will get record prices for the wheat he’s able to harvest … and he’s grateful.

“We’ve had a couple of tough years so this is going to help producers heal up some wounds,” he said. “It’s a godsend.”

Yet the global events that have led to a windfall for Minnesota wheat farmers are expected to have a devastating impact in some of the poorer regions of the world. The United Nations said there had already been a global food crisis because of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. That crisis rose to famine levels worldwide by the war in wheat-growing Ukraine and the resulting lack of grain exports, the UN says.

“When war is waged, people go hungry,” said António Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations, at a ministerial meeting last month.

Although the United States was once the dominant producer of wheat, Russia has surpassed us in recent years. And Ukraine became a breadbasket too as the world’s fourth-largest producer of wheat.

Before Russian waged war on Ukraine, wheat supplies from the two accounted for almost 30% of global trade. Not only has that trade been decimated, but other wheat-producing regions, like India, have suffered from bad weather and banned or sharply curtailed exports.

The cost of everything from bread and cakes to noodles and pasta has risen in recent months as wheat prices soared on world commodity market – and prices are expected to continue to climb.

Frayne Olson, a crop economist and marketing specialist at North Dakota State University, agreed with the United Nations that poor nations that rely on imports of wheat, like Egypt and other countries in the Middle East and Africa, could go hungry as prices escalate beyond their reach.

But Olson said Americans won’t suffer from shortages, as U.S. farmers usually produce more than enough for domestic consumption. “We will be all right,” he said.

If food prices continue to escalate in the United States, however, there may be pressure on the federal government to continue a COVID-induced expansion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, to help low-income families. Those additional benefits are set to expire mid-July.

Another program, promoted by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-5th, that let school districts provide universal meals is set to expire at the end of the month. Omar is pressing the Biden administration for an extension.

“As a refugee and former nutrition educator, I am horrified by the looming global and domestic food crisis,” said Omar, who was born in Somalia. “Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the ensuing increase in wheat prices, combined with supply change issues and a rapidly changing climate are threatening to create conditions for the most dire famine in years.”

Dufault’s family farm spans four generations and is now 1,600 acres planted in wheat and soybeans. To him, modern agriculture has always meant surpluses.

“Now there might be people who don’t have enough to eat,” he said ruefully.

Charlie Vogel, CEO of the Minnesota Association of Wheat Growers, echoed that sentiment. “We’ve gone 40 years without having to worry about food security. That’s going to be top of mind now,” he said. “People are going to be thinking about food security.”

Nervous farmers

Normally, on average, about 30% of the wheat produced in Minnesota is exported, Vogel said. That percentage may fall this year if yields are low and its harder for importing nations to pay the higher price of U.S. wheat.

But that’s not at the top of Dufault’s worries, even if he is the vice chair of the Minnesota Wheat Research and Promotion Council board. Like other wheat growers in the United States and around the world, Dufault has had to battle adverse weather this year.

A cold and rainy spring delayed planting – Dufault said he’s finished on June 6, the latest planting date he can remember. He also said there are concerns that a hot, dry summer can hurt this year’s wheat crop in Minnesota.

“Our wheat doesn’t like heat very much,” he said. “There’s a lot of nervous producers this spring.”

Dufault, and most Minnesota and North Dakota wheat farmers, grow what is known as hard red spring wheat, which is usually planted in April and early May and harvested in August. This type of wheat is rich in protein and used in higher end bread products such as crunchy crusted French bread, as well as tortillas, cereal and Asian noodles.

Other regions in the nation produce other types of wheat with different growing seasons. Kansas, for instance, produces hard red winter wheat that is planted in the fall and harvested in the Spring.

Flour made from hard winter wheat is used to make softer types of breads. Other types of wheat grown in the United States are milled into flours that are used in baking cookies, cakes, crackers and frozen foods.

While they may end up in different baked goods, all types of U.S.- produced wheat has one thing in common – they have all risen in price.

That’s a boon to the Midwest.

According to the USDA, North Dakota produced the most wheat in the United States in 2020, followed by Kansas, Montana, Washington, Idaho and Oklahoma. Minnesota was ranked seventh, producing nearly 73 million bushels of wheat that year.

Wheat isn’t the only agriculture commodity whose price is increasing, although it may be rising at a faster rate than others. The price of corn, soybeans and cotton has also soared.

That’s not to say everything is rosy on the American farm. The cost of fertilizer, seed, machinery, diesel and other farm inputs have hit farmers, so much so that Dufault is glad he pre-bought some of the fertilizer he used on this year’s crop last summer

“That kind of sheltered me a bit,” he said.

Vogel of the Minnesota Association of Wheat Growers said Russia and Ukraine are also major producers of nitrogen-based fertilizers – whose price has more than doubled – and other raw materials used in farming.

“There’s been a lot of disruption to that supply chain,” Vogel said.

Still, Minnesota wheat farmers are expected to benefit from the increased global demand on their harvest, especially if their yields are good.

“Commodity prices are going to be up for a while,” Vogel said.",,[],"['Ana Radelat', 'Staff Writer']"
"Economy, China, Climate Dominate As Australia Set For Polls","Australians will go to the polls on Saturday following a six-week campaign that has focused on pandemic-fuelled inflation, climate change and fears of a Chinese military outpost being established less than 2,000 kilometers off Australia's shore.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative coalition is seeking a rare fourth three-year term.

He began the campaign in April by urging voters to stick with a government that delivered one of the lowest pandemic death tolls of any advanced economy rather than risk the opposition centre-left Labour Party.

An early election late last year had been widely anticipated with Morrison expected to reap the political capital from his government's success in containing the spread of COVID-19 in the first year of the pandemic.

But his nickname “ScoMo” was changed by critics to “SloMo” a year ago when Australia's vaccine rollout fell months behind schedule.

Australia has recorded more than double the number of COVID-19 deaths so far this year than it did during the first two years of the pandemic. Around 8,000 people have died with COVID-19 among Australia's population of 26 million. Only 2,239 died in 2020 and 2021.

The more transmissible virus variants have tarnished the government's pandemic record.

The government changed voting regulations on Friday to enable thousands of people who have recently been infected with COVID-19 to vote by phone.

“Making this change this late in the process is not without risk, but we think it's worthwhile, particularly given the community sentiment, and that is why we've asked the government to make that change and the government has agreed,” Australian Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers said.

Rogers said some polling booths would be closed on Saturday because many of the 105,000 election workers were sick with the virus or flu.

Army reservists have been asked to fill in.

The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have pushed up costs of living and cast doubt on the conservatives' boast of being better economic managers than Labour.

After the annual inflation rate soared to 5.1% in the March quarter, the central bank lifted its benchmark interest rate for the first time in more than 11 years from 0.1% to 0.35%.

Two weeks after cash rose by a quarter of a percentage point to 6.75% in November 2007, Prime Minister John Howard's conservative government was voted out of office, ending more than 11 years in power.

Opposition treasury spokesperson Jim Chalmers described the rate hike this month as a “full-blown cost of living crisis on Scott Morrison's watch.” Labour has also taken aim at the government's foreign policy credentials after China and the Solomon Islands confirmed during the election campaign they had finalised a bilateral security pact.

Labour described it as Australia's worst foreign policy failure in the Pacific since World War II.

Australia already has a security pact with the Solomons and is the impoverished South Pacific island nation's most generous provider of foreign aid.

Foreign Minister Marise Payne had proposed in November doubling Australian aid to the Pacific to 2.88 billion Australian dollars ($2 billion) a year to counter China's rising influence, The Australian newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources. But she was refused by her Cabinet's national security committee colleagues.

Morrison declined to confirm or deny the newspaper report because of the secrecy surrounding the committee's deliberations.

Morrison rejected the premise of a question when a reporter asked if he would consider doubling Pacific aid to counter Beijing's moves.

“You're suggesting that if you just double funding in the Pacific then somehow the Chinese government doesn't have any influence or won't be successful in seeking to coerce or exert its influence in the southwest Pacific,” he said. “Thats your assumption and that assumption doesn't hold.” Solomons Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said that there will be no Chinese naval base in his country and China has denied seeking a military foothold in the islands.

Senior government lawmakers have said the timing of the China-Solomons agreement during an election campaign is evidence that Beijing was attempting to undermine the ruling coalition's prospects for reelection.

The government maintains that Beijing wants a change of leadership because a Labour administration would be less likely to stand up against Chinese economic coercion.

As well as campaigning against Labour, Morrison's conservative Liberal Party is fighting off a new challenge from so-called teal independent candidates to key government lawmakers' reelection in party strongholds.

The teal independents are marketed as a greener shade than the Liberal Party's traditional blue colour and want stronger government action on reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions than either the government or Labor are proposing.

The government aims to reduce Australia's emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Labour has promised a 43% reduction.

Recent opinion polls have put Labour narrowly ahead of the coalition. But the pollsters' credibility has yet to recover since their spectacular failure in the 2019 election.

The split of votes between the government and Labour in 2019 was 51.5% to 48.5% — the mirror opposite of the result that Australia's five most prominent polls predicted.

"As Klarna cuts jobs, rival fintechs say they're recruiting for hundreds of roles","Not all fintech unicorns are cutting jobs.

After Klarna announced plans to lay off 10% of its workforce Monday, some rival fintechs are making it clear that they have no intention of cutting jobs or freezing hiring.

Revolut, the $33 billion digital banking start-up, said the company is ""actively hiring,"" with over 250 open roles listed on its website.

Meanwhile, Wise CEO Kristo Kaarmann said the London-based money transfer firm is in a ""different place"" to tech firms that are letting staff go.

""Years of building Wise as a profitable long-term company is paying off now,"" Kaarmann tweeted Wednesday.

""So much demand for international banking, we can't hire people fast enough to build it.""

Meanwhile, German digital bank N26 said it has ""no current plans to reduce headcount."" The firm was last valued at $9 billion.

""We are going to continue to make strategic investments to grow our team with a focus on product, technology, compliance and financial crime prevention,"" an N26 spokesperson said.

It marks a stark contrast with Klarna. The buy now, pay later firm — which lets shoppers split their purchases into equal, monthly installments — said it plans to cut an estimated 700 roles due to a souring economic climate.

""When we set our business plans for 2022 in the autumn of last year, it was a very different world than the one we are in today,"" Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told staff in a pre-recorded video on Monday.

""Since then, we have seen a tragic and unnecessary war in Ukraine unfold, a shift in consumer sentiment, a steep increase in inflation, a highly volatile stock market and a likely recession.""

Other financial tech firms, such as Robinhood and Better.com, have also taken measures to cut jobs and rein in costs this year.

Digital finance got a major boost from the Covid pandemic as people turned to online channels to make payments, apply for loans and trade shares. But the sector has taken a beating in 2022 as the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and higher interest rates have led investors to question lofty valuations in the space.

Wise, for example, has lost nearly two thirds of its market value since its July 2021 listing.

Rishi Khosla, CEO of U.K. online lender OakNorth, said there have been ""massive bubbles"" in fintech — from buy now, pay later to crypto. He said BNPL had been allowed to flourish largely thanks to ""regulatory arbitrage.""

""Ultimately, the regulation is going to catch up with them, and therefore this the opportunity is not going to continue,"" he said.

Klarna is reportedly seeking funds at a 34% discount to its last investment round, which valued the company at $46 billion. A Klarna spokesperson dismissed this as speculation.

Asked whether Revolut plans to follow suit, a company spokesperson said it has no intention to do so.",,[],['Ryan Browne']
HMC: 2 Undervalued Auto Manufacturing Stocks That Yield More Than 3%,"The global semiconductor shortage and supply chain crisis exacerbated by the ongoing Russian-Ukraine war have wreaked havoc on the auto manufacturing industry.
