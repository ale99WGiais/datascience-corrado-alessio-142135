"Seaweed Protein Market Size To Reach $1,397.7 Million by 2030, says P&S Intelligence","NEW YORK, June 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In 2021, the worldwide seaweed protein market was worth around $513.7 million, which is set to touch $1,397.7 million by 2030, growing at an 11.8% CAGR from 2021 to 2030, according to the latest market research study published by P&S Intelligence. A growing trend is protein extraction from eatable seaweeds for a variety of health purposes. Alternative protein sources are preferred since, unlike cow ranching, they do not take up additional land or cause greenhouse gas emissions while being cultivated.

Highest Revenue Generator Is Protein Extracted from Red Seaweeds

In 2021, proteins produced from red seaweeds accounted for an over 70% share in the seaweed protein market. Red seaweeds account for over half of all the seaweed farming practiced globally. Nori, a red seaweed with a protein level of up to 47%, has the highest measured protein content. Humans use red seaweed mostly as a binder in food items and as a bacterial substrate in labs.

Key Findings of Seaweed Protein Market Report

The various non-food uses of seaweeds, such as nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, animal feed, biofertilizers/bio-stimulants, cosmetics, bio-packaging, carbon capture or sequestration, biofuels, and textile fibers, are projected to drive the market growth in the future.

Because of their health, nutritional, and socioeconomic benefits, seaweed proteins are becoming a popular alternative protein source throughout the world.

In the year 2021, the food sector accounted for over 80% of the total income from the sale of seaweed proteins. Product consumption in the food sector continues to be driven by the increasing demand for seaweed snacks and growing popularity of Japanese cuisine.

Conventional methods of extraction held a 55% share of the seaweed protein market in the past. When compared to other approaches, seaweed extracts made using the conventional alkaline process give higher yields.

Seaweed production in China is the world's highest. China's eight farmed seaweed species can provide protein equivalent to 3 million tons of rice, 1.5 million tons of pork, 11 million tons of spinach, and 15 million tons of potatoes in a year.

Regional Analysis

The utilization of hydrocolloids and seaweeds in APAC accounts for almost 60% of the seaweed protein market share. China has surpassed the U.S. as the leading importer of non-edible and edible seaweed for processing. Similarly, behind China, the Philippines is the world's second-largest supplier of processed and semi-processed carrageenan. Carrageenan exports from the Philippines have surged by more than 40% in the last 10 years.

Global Oleochemicals Market Overview

Manufacturers are turning to oleochemicals as a renewable, sustainable alternative in the chemical sourcing industry to meet consumer demands. Bio-based chemical manufacturing is important in markets that prioritize functionality, and demand for sustainable sourcing will rise as the global population grows. As the demand for environmentally friendly products grows and the price of oil rises, the need for oleochemicals will rise as well. The growing demand for bio-based plastics is likely to boost the market growth. Oleochemicals are a low-cost, widely available alternative to industrial chemicals and fuels. These environmental and economic advantages are driving up demand for oleochemicals all around the globe.

Owing to rising crude oil prices and the affordability of plant-based lauric oils produced from palm kernels, manufacturers began switching from petrochemicals to oleochemicals in the late 1970s. Fatty acids, the most widely used oleochemical, and other basic oleochemical substances are produced by a variety of chemical and enzymatic reactions. However, volatility in the feedstock market restrains the Oleo Chemicals Market growth. Furthermore, oleochemicals are used in a wide range of applications, and several emerging oleochemical uses are replacing petroleum-based products, offering a significant growth opportunity for global Oleochemicals industry players.

Global Bioenergies receives first orders from a number of major cosmetics players totalling several tonnes of Isonaturane® 12

Paris, 07 June 2022 – Less than two months after the commissioning of the Pomacle commercial production unit, Global Bioenergies has received its first orders totalling several tonnes of Isonaturane® 12 from a number of major cosmetics players, including L’Oréal.

Isonaturane® 12 is the trademark registered by Global Bioenergies to designate its naturally sourced isododecane product. Isododecane is one of the most important molecules used in the cosmetics industry, both in the make-up segment, where it is the only molecule able to deliver longwear properties, and in skincare and haircare, where it endows textures with lightness and softness. Thanks to Global Bioenergies, this compound is now available in a bio-sourced version that meets ISO 16128 requirements in terms of naturalness in cosmetics products. Isonaturane®12 is manufactured entirely in France from locally sourced raw materials.

For L’Oréal, Global Bioenergies’ leading shareholder via the company’s BOLD (Business Opportunities for L’Oréal Development) investment fund, these first orders of Isonaturane® will contribute to support the Group’s efforts in terms of naturalness of its make-up products and are in line with the ambitious objectives of its Sustainability program L’Oréal for the Future.

Ana Kljuic, Vice-President R&I L’Oréal for the Future & Green Sciences, explained: “Our investment in Global Bioenergies is at the core of our commitment to achieve 95% bio-based ingredients, derived from abundant minerals or circular processes in our formulas by 2030. Thanks to its breakthrough technology that is now becoming an industrial reality, Global Bioenergies drives forward the cosmetics sector in its quest for naturalness and, beyond cosmetics, helps it to make a broader proactive contribution to the environmental transition.”

Daphne Galvez, Global Bioenergies Commercial Director, added: “Today, longstanding discussions with specific key players come to fruition. A further spate of orders is under preparation: at In-cosmetics, the world-leading event for cosmetics ingredients held last month in Paris at which we launched Isonaturane® 12 on the market, we held around a hundred discussions with a range of stakeholders including brands, tollers and distributors.”

Eurofragance Presents New Collections At In-Cosmetics 2022,"Eurofragrance showcased its new Ecoconscious and Sensolab collections at In-cosmetics, a leading fair for personal care ingredients, held between April 5th and 7th in Paris. The collections focus on sustainability and innovation and align with the company’s strategic plan and are intended to answer current consumer desires.

The creative Sensolab collection offers new sensorial experience with its solid fragrance formats, made possible thanks to technological innovation. This eco-friendly collection is characterized by products that use less water or are water-free. These products require less packaging, are lighter and are responsible for lower carbon emissions thanks to improved shipping conditions.

The collection includes a body lotion stick fragranced with bergamot and cannabis notes that is easy to carry and use as a basic cosmetic; a water-free coffee and white flower scented solid conditioner and a powder shampoo with hints of apricot and carrot, that eliminates the need for water. Other products included are a pocket deodorant in a compact powder format and a bath confetti soap that brings playfulness to the shower, in a format that diffuses olfactive notes of mandarin.

The company also presented the Ecoconscious collection of vegan, sustainable fragrances with natural ingredients, formulated with some eco-certifiable ingredients.

The multinational revealed various applications created with L’Ame du Bois™, the first captive perfumery ingredient derived from wood waste and developed by Eurofragance in October 2021. It was introduced at in-cosmetics this April in the form of fine fragrances, a shampoo and a scented candle.

Being an important ingredient in its history, the company looked for a way to produce a natural extract from wood without deforestation or negatively impacting the environment, and did so by upcycling discarded sawdust from a particular tree. After a time consuming and repetitive purification process, they were able to uncover an ingredient with the best olfactory profile, while retaining the soul of the wood.

Olegario Monegal, Global Business Unit Director of Home and Personal Care, explains, “These two categories, ‘home’ and ‘personal care’ are booming in Europe. Our presence at in-cosmetics illustrates our particular desire to accelerate our growth in personal care. We have a palette of high-quality raw materials and an excellent level of customer service along with valuable market knowledge that make us ready to respond to new consumer demands.”",,[],[]

Supply chain interruptions, human shortages, logistical restrictions, component shortages, demand reduction, inadequate corporate finances, and lockouts in numerous nations have hurt the sector. In this crisis, raw material suppliers and other enterprises must reconsider their strategies to serve this industry. The outbreak has halted residential and commercial construction. During the crisis, this industry's bio-butanol demand will be low to medium.

Delays in order delivery, supply chain constraints, a lack of people and equipment, and a lack of materials are all major concerns. After the crisis, demand for bio-Butanol is expected to surge. Even without shutdowns, restrictions on personnel and materials have slowed operations. Countries relaxed restrictions and opened business in many industries in 2020. Even after the lockout, bio-Butanol facilities will have trouble restarting. This affects bio-Butanol sales.

Bio-Butanol Market: Segmentation Overview

The global Bio-Butanol market is segregated based on Raw Material, Application, and End-Use Industry.

In terms of Application, the acrylates category led the global market in the forecast period. Growing demand for the product from different coatings applications such as paper coatings, leather coatings, and water-based coatings is likely to drive growth throughout the forecast period. Furthermore, increased R&D on bio-butanol as a motor fuel to replace gasoline due to its better physical qualities and cost-effectiveness is projected to generate new market prospects in the near future.

In terms of Raw Materials, Cereals represented a substantial proportion of the bio-butanol market in the forecast period. Butanol may be produced from a range of agricultural and forestry leftovers, as well as some energy crops, such as apple pomace, potato peel, brewer's wasted malt, corn cobs, corn stover, and corn fiber. Whereas the production process includes pre-treatment of wheat straw with dilute sulphuric acid to enhance cellulose accessibility to hydrolytic enzymes. The pretreated wheat straw is then hydrolyzed with hydrolytic enzymes to break down the cellulose into simple 5-carbon or 6-carbon sugars, followed by a combination fed-batch fermentation/gas stripping process to convert the sugars to butanol without product inhibition. As cereals are the primary raw material used in the manufacturing of bio-butanol, an increase in cereal output may aid in the expansion of the bio-butanol industry.

Biomimicry: Can beauty benefit from copying the natural world?,"By Julia Wray

13-Jun-2022

The cosmetics sector has long sourced ingredients from nature, but all industries are now borrowing from how the natural world functions. Cosmetics Business asks, to what extent can beauty embrace biomimicry?

Research into the mysteries of the natural world is increasingly informing human innovation. From ultra-strong composites copying the architecture of the mantis shrimp’s punching clubs (made by Helicoid Industries, and used to strengthen turbines, aircraft and automobiles), to ECOncrete’s environmentally sensitive concrete structures that mimic the form of natural marine environments to create resilient coastlines, industries across the board are seeing the benefits of working ‘like nature’.

“Biomimicry is the conscious emulation of nature’s strategies,” explains Lex Amore, Communications Director at the Biomimicry Institute.

“It mimics the strategies that are found in nature to solve human design challenges.”

And, while we are seeing an upswell in interest in biomimicry, it is far from a modern development.

“It’s a practice that has been going on for a really long time,” says Amore. “Humans have been asking nature for guidance long before the Industrial Revolution, but, somewhere along the line, we got a little distracted and forgot how to fit into the natural world and into this ecosystem that we are very much a part of.”

Amore stresses the importance of differentiating between ‘bio-utilisation’ and biomimicry with the following analogy: “Let’s say mangroves are really good at creating resilient coastlines. Rather than planting mangroves, [biomimicry] would be asking ‘how does the mangrove actually support these coastlines?’

“After billions of years of research and development, the organisms that are alive today are our champions – they are the ones that are our mentors, our models, and they really hold the secret to our survival.

“The goal through biomimetic design is to create products, processes and systems – essentially new ways of living – that solve our greatest design challenges sustainably and in unison with all life on Earth.”

While we have not identified any material adverse effect resulting from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic and any potential future impact it may have on our business and results of operations. The extent to which our operations will be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on unknown developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning our customers, the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, among other things. Regional or global conflicts, including wars or economic sanctions between nations, price inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Puerto Rico government financial constraints, the Tax Reform, and possible tax changes on jurisdictions where we do business, bio-pharmaceutical industry consolidations, trends on managing contract resources, all pose current and future challenges which may adversely affect our future performance. We believe that our future profitability and liquidity will be dependent on our ability to seek service opportunities and adapt to industry trends, which are affected by variables such as local and global economy, any impacts of regional or global conflicts, price inflation, any impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, changes in tax laws, worldwide life science manufacturing industry consolidations, operational constraints imposed by our customers due to the coronavirus pandemic and resource management trends.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including planned capital expenditures. As of April 30, 2022 , the Company had approximately $16.9 million in working capital.

On June 13, 2014 , the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to repurchase up to two million shares of its common stock (the ""Repurchase Program""). The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. During the six-month period ended April 30, 2022 , the Company repurchased 70,903 shares of its common stock. As of April 30, 2022 , the Company has 1,562,343 shares of common stock available for future repurchases under the Repurchase Program. Our primary cash needs consist of the payment of compensation to our consulting team, overhead expenses, and statutory taxes. Additionally, we may use cash for the repurchase of our common stock under the Repurchase Program, capital expenditures and business development expenses. Management believes that based on the current level of working capital, operations and cash flows from operations, and the collectability of high-quality customer receivables are sufficient to fund anticipated expenses and satisfy other possible long-term contractual commitments. To the extent that we pursue possible opportunities to expand our operations, either by acquisition or by the establishment of operations in a new market, we will incur additional overhead, and there may be a delay between the period we commence operations and our generation of net cash flow from operations. While uncertainties relating to the current local and global economic condition, competition, the industries and geographical regions served by us and other regulatory matters exist within the consulting services industry, as described above, management is not aware of any other trends or events likely to have a material adverse effect on liquidity or its financial statements.

Lucrative growth in Southeast Asian Countries

The increased awareness about animal welfare and the harmful impacts of synthetic cosmetics across the southeast Asian countries are driving the demand for halal cosmetics. Further, countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia have a majority of the Muslim population which is driving the demand for halal cosmetics in such countries. Moreover, the implementation of halal product law in Indonesia has positively impacted the market. The halal product law was implemented in 2019, and it applies to cosmetics, foods, and non-food products & services. Under this set of regulations, all foreign beauty products distributed or retailed in Indonesia will be treated as non-halal cosmetic products until the products are halal certified in Indonesia or by an accredited foreign certification body. Also, the presence of established halal cosmetic brands such as Wardah has led to the increased demand for halal cosmetics in Southeast Asian countries.

Halal Cosmetics Market Size: Segment Overview

Based on product type, the market is segmented into skincare, haircare, makeup, and others. In 2021, the skincare segment held the largest halal cosmetics market share. The skincare product category includes cosmetic products such as moisturizers, hydrating and anti-aging creams, toners, serums, and lotions. The growing demand for health-promoting and self-care products worldwide has led to the growth of the skincare segment.

Based on category, the halal cosmetics market is segmented into men, women, and unisex. The women segment is expected to grow rapidly during the forecast period. The growing number of working women and the growing number of beauty clinics are aiding the halal cosmetics market.

Based on distribution channel, the market is segmented into supermarkets and hypermarkets, specialty stores, online retail, and others. The online retail segment is expected to grow rapidly during the forecast period. The increased adoption of e-commerce by the consumers due to its various benefits, such as home delivery, varied payment options, and attractive discounts and offers for customers, has led to an increased demand for halal cosmetics from e-commerce platforms.

Halal cosmetics are products that do not include any ingredient derived from animals. These products are progressively gaining traction worldwide, especially since customers across all industries indicate a preference for cruelty-free cosmetic products. They are made using a complex combination of ingredients in accordance with halal guidelines. Manufacturers continuously check the products to ensure that they meet the halal grade. In comparison to standard cosmetics products on the market, the safety and quality of halal cosmetic principles are difficult to assess.

This reason also adds to the increased global popularity of halal-certified cosmetics. As a result, the halal cosmetics business is expected to rise in the future. Moreover, the younger generation is more concerned about adopting environment friendly practices. Halal is the most recent addition to the sustainability category. Consumer understanding of ingredients used in cosmetics has risen dramatically in recent years. Consumers' changing behavior patterns, which have made them more concerned about animal welfare, have resulted in a shift toward more sustainable and environment friendly alternatives.

JM: How is Virospack managing its commitment to the environment in its new developments and manufacturing processes?

JS:

JM: How do you see the company advancing its cosmetic packaging in the future?

JS:

Founded in 1956, Virospack has majorly advanced their production of what was once a simple black rubber dropper of high quality and functionality used on a pharma bottle, to a vast range of sophisticated droppers and bottles with striking deco effects, designed to stand out in the cosmetic market. The Barcelona-headquartered supplier prides itself on in-house production of all the components of their packs, which Jordi Salas, Technical Manager, Virospack, says gives them control over quality and timing from the start of production to the dispatch of the parts. New, advanced technology ensures production meets the highest standards available. Here, Salas tells Beauty Packaging’s Jamie Matusow about the future of innovative new dispenser packs, and machines and technologies that will ensure production success.The origin of Virospack is in rubber, and the pharmaceutical industry. The continuous development and the use of new technologies led Virospack to evolve into the production of droppers for the cosmetic market. Over time, the company specialized in the manufacture and decoration of vials, and internalized all the production processes, such as the manufacture of glass pipettes and metallization.The great advantage of Virospack over the competition is the production of all the components of our packs, which gives us control over quality and timing from the start of production to the dispatch of the parts.Our keen attention to quality and service is what makes us different. Virospack has always invested in quality, which has made our products meet the highest requirements in the cosmetic market.Another strength which Virospack holds, is the possibility to offer different materials and technologies for the parts of the components. This makes it possible to always find a solution for dispensing the product. We offer a range of materials—Pipettes in plastic or glass, Caps in plastic compression or injection plastic, and Bulbs in plastic (TPE) or Rubber-. In addition, Virospack can develop custom components for special requirements.The change is continuous. Virospack is always focusing on improving the quality and sustainability of all the production processes. Lately, we have built new facilities, dramatically increasing our production capacity, and improving the production layout. The latest investments have focused on the automation and the introduction of quality control systems with artificial vision. The glass production capacity has been boosted with the acquisition of state-of-the-art machines. New machines have incorporated the new technology of Deep Learning.We design our droppers from the beginning of the development, with sustainable materials and the most efficient manufacturing technologies, and create designs that allow the recyclability of the manufactured items.One of the strengths of Virospack is the possibility of personalizing the packs, having the ability to perform screen printing, hot stamping, pad printing, painting and also metallizing.What makes us really stand out in this regard is Virospack’s metallization section with 3 fully automated lines, one of them with a new sputtering application system. This allows us to offer the most suitable finish according to the client's requirements.Virospack was a pioneer in introducing water-based lacquers in its painting section, and high-solid lacquers in metallization. Currently we are working to introduce bio-based lacquers in the metallization process.Our latest development is a PCR dropper, in which all components are produced of material with a high percentage of PCR and with the benefit of being recyclable. In addition to the wide range of models available, it is possible to complement it with the option of a PCR glass bottle.New sustainable solutions include our Wooden Dropper, which was launched last year and, to-date, the only one on the market made of 100% wood, with a single-piece wooden cap and without any plastic or glue inside. This reduced two processes—in its manufacturing and in the carbon footprint of the dropper. Recently, we have also launched our award-winning Childproof Dropper with a metal shell option for a more luxury finish.We can say that finally the market is committed to sustainability, and Virospack is ready to take on this challenge, betting on PCR's, water-based lacquers, biodegradable materials and more. This determined commitment to sustainability has created a Green awareness in the factory, where the 4 R’s are applied, and continuous improvement projects make industrial processes more sustainable.The future is to produce packs with a sustainable process. A distinguishing feature will be the use of PCRs, as well as the introduction of wood and bio-based material into the world of cosmetics. It will be essential to design packs that can be easily recycled. Another important thing is the innovation to produce a new kind of dispenser with very specific characteristics that provide new experiences in the dosage of the cosmetic droppers. Machines and technologies have to evolve in order to ensure more efficient processes.",,[],[]
Ocean Rainforest leads successful €9 million seaweed grant bid,"Funded by the Horizon Europe Framework Programme “Circular economy and bioeconomy sectors” (HORIZON-CL6-2021-CIRCBIO-01), the SeaMark project aims to lay the foundations for an entirely new European maritime industry to meet growing demand for seaweed-based products and attract investment from multiple sectors.



SeaMark (short for ""Seaweed-Based Market Applications"") aims to exploit the full spectrum of products derived from seaweeds on an unprecedented scale – from medicine to cosmetics, human food and animal feed. Seaweeds are among the fastest growing crops on the planet, requiring only sunlight, carbon dioxide and naturally occurring nutrients to grow. They are also rich in bioactive compounds with various medicinal, nutritional and biomechanical properties.

During the four-year project, SeaMark's multi-disciplinary team will develop 12 innovative products with direct market applications, predominantly based on cultivated sugar kelp (S. latissima). These include a bio-packaging material, a meat replacer and feed supplements with pre- and probiotic functional ingredients to improve digestibility, conversion ratios and overall sustainability and productivity of conventional livestock feeds. Alongside market applications, SeaMark will quantify ecosystem services provided by seaweed farms, contributing to a body of evidence justifying large-scale seaweed cultivation as a bioremediation tool and key element of a new circular bioeconomy.",,[],[]
How close are we to 3D printing organs for human transplants?,"Insight

3D printed tissues for ear, skin and blood vessels are in clinical trials and research for other organs is underway too. We ask some bioprinting companies if and when humans can benefit from this technology.

Scientists and researchers across the globe are working hard to bioprint functional human organs to meet the demand of a growing list of people waiting for organ transplants across the world.

There are currently more than 106,000 people waiting for an organ transplant in the United States alone, with a new person added every 9 minutes to the list.

Many of these people are in need of critical organs such as kidneys, hearts and livers that could save their lives. However, due to limited resources, around 8,000 Americans on the waiting list die each year.

Biotechnology company Regemat 3D believes the development of bioengineered organs for human transplants is an attainable goal and that 3D bioprinting will have a main role in that accomplishment.

“We believe 3D bioprinting is and will be a key factor in the progress towards more efficient and personalised medical treatments in the upcoming future,” Sara Mico, Regemat 3D’s Business Developer and Product Specialist, told TRT World.

Since 2015, Regemat 3D has grown to become one of the top 15 3D bioprinting emerging companies worldwide, with a presence in nearly 30 countries.

“We are the only company in the world specialised in the design and development of customised 3D bioprinters and bioreactors for tissue engineering applications,” said Mico.

Some benefits of 3D bioprinting cited by Mico include the potential to accelerate the development of new drugs and shorten the time required for them to reach the market and reduce the number of animals used in research.

But how far off is the expansion of this technology to creating complex organs?

Bioprinting company nScrypt predicts this reality will emerge within the next decade, Marketing/Sales and Communications Specialist Brandon B. Dickerson told TRT World.

“We all have our crystal balls, and I say 5 to 10 years. I think soon, I’ll be saying 4 to 8 years, we are closing the gap,” said Dickerson.

In contrast, Fabien Guillemot, CEO of next-generation bioprinting company Poietis, told TRT World it’s “difficult to define when (and if) the world will be able to print organs” due to the different degree of tissue complexity compared to that of organs.

“Different 3D bioprinted tissues are entering into clinical trials (ear, skin, blood vessels). Other applications like heart patches, cornea, cartilage are also in preclinical development in many institutions and companies, worldwide.”

Guillemot said all these trials contain tissues that have a different degree of complexity, which remains lower than that of an organ's, for example some are flat tissues and some include one or two different cell types.

“But, implanting bioprinted functional tissues might be sufficient to restore and repair organ functions without changing the whole organ,” said Guillemot. “So, we anticipate that clinicians will use in routine bioprinting and bioprinted tissue products made of the patient’s own cells.”

Mico said that while the field is still “very far” from the reality of bioprinting complex organs “it is so important to invest time and resources in basic and translational research today, because today’s research will become the clinical applications of tomorrow.”

From research to clinical trials

While bioprinting was initially proposed around two decades ago, its first applications have been for research and testing such as in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, Guillemot told TRT World.

Then in 1999, a functioning human bladder was the first artificial organ made using bioprinting by scientists at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine.

However, to be able to start a clinical trial was challenging as companies needed “to develop a bioprinter compliant with the regulations and to develop a tissue fabrication process leveraging this bioprinter,” Guillemot explained.

Fast forward 23 years and this was achieved by 3DBioTherapeutics. A 20-year-old woman born with a rare congenital deformity in her right ear became the first person to receive a 3D-printed ear implant made from her own living cells.

The medical breakthrough made headlines this month after the New York-based medical company took a sample of cartilage cells from the patient’s ear and grew them in a lab to create an implant.

The human cells were mixed with a collagen-based bio-ink before being inserted into a 3D bioprinter, which layer-by-layer created a mirror replica of the patient’s left ear, the company’s chief scientific officer, Nathaniel Bachrach, told the New York Times.

The company’s AuriNovo implant technology is currently being used in a clinical trial to help patients with microtia, a condition where one or both outer ears are absent or underdeveloped.

CEO and co-founder of 3DBioTherapeutics Dr. Daniel Cohen called the transplant a “truly historic moment for patients with microtia,” a condition that affects around 1,500 babies in the US each year.

“And more broadly for the regenerative medicine field as we are beginning to demonstrate the real-world application of next-generation tissue engineering technology,” said Cohen.

Cohen hopes AuriNovo will become “the standard-of-care” as it is less invasive than current surgical methods for ear reconstruction that use rib cartilage.

Guillemot said that the success by 3DBioTherapeutics “shows that bioprinting is coming of age for therapeutic applications” and “can provide new solutions for patients and clinicians.”

“Being one of the few bioprinting companies engaged in the development of therapeutic applications, we (Poietis) are very enthusiastic by this news,” Guillemot said.

He said that his company plans to also start the clinical trial of its first bioprinted product Poieskin, a skin substitute, in the coming months.

Bioprinting in space

But the bioprinting process comes with challenges – a lot of which comes “from biomaterial availability,” Micro explains.

“We carry out our own internal research – such as the development of a conductive bioink for peripheral nerve and spinal cord regeneration – and we identify promising biomaterials and help the research groups who developed them to bring them out into the market,” said Micro.

Other main challenges of bioprinting are related to the standardisation of tissue manufacturing process and the capacity to print more complex tissues in a way which is compatible with clinician routines and hospital constraints, according to Guillemot.

His company Poietis is addressing these challenges by developing next-generation bioprinters ""which are robotised, multimodal and provide high-resolution. ""

One of Poietis’s bioprinter has been installed in the Cell Therapy Center of Marseille Hospitals, as the company plans to equip cell therapy centers in hospitals “to enable them to develop and produce new applications for patients.”

“Installing bioprinters directly into hospitals, at the point of care, can reduce high costs and logistics challenges that you meet when you transfer living cells and tissues from the ""factory"" to the bedside,” said Guillemot.

In addition, bioprinting research is not just limited to laboratories and hospitals on Earth. Researchers at nScrypt in collaboration with Redwire’s Techshot are working on printing methods in microgravity, with the goal of eventually taking bioprinting capabilities to space.

“The first set of printing experiments is to print cardiovascular cells in microgravity to study any effects microgravity might have on printed cells,” Dickerson told TRT World.

“The bioprinter is set up to print a range of materials to include cellular and acellular materials. The intent is to allow a diverse group of scientists that want to print in microgravity this capability,” he added.

Aftermath of bioprinting

Another challenge faced by nScrypt’s teams and bioengineers as a whole is the aftermath of bioprinting and avoiding necrosis.

“Necrosis is the enemy, this means cells die and this occurs for many reasons, but just as your entire body needs food, oxygen and then to remove carbon dioxide and waste, so must cells and tissue,” said Dickerson explaining the importance of a vascular network for the bioprinted organs.

Companies are growing great vascularised tissue, but using thicker tissue in organs, makes it more challenging to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out.

“Bioprinting is important, but the incubation and feeding part is where the magic happens. There is no such thing and there will be no such thing as printing an organ,” Dickerson said, adding when this is achieved then the organ growing potential will begin moving more rapidly.

Aside from organ transplants, manufacturing artificial organs with 3D printing has the potential to help several sectors in the medicine field, such as in pharmaceutical research and the training of surgeons.

Using a patient’s own cells to create the 3D printed organs also greatly reduces the risk of donor organs being rejected by the body. But as experts point out, the finances of bioprinting remain another obstacle.

“The near future of bioprinting is discovery and experimental. We talk about a big game, but we still have quite a bit in front of us,” said Dickerson. “(This) will not happen if there is not a good business model.”

“This means money. This must make money. It is easy to make the business case, ‘how much are you willing to pay for a kidney or a heart?’ It is a cruel reality, but a reality nonetheless. But before we get to that, we must ask, how much are you willing to spend to learn how to do it?”

"Challenges in formulating natural, organic sunscreen products","A research team out of Italy and the US, Tortini et al, recently published a narrative review of natural and organic sunscreen formulations in the Cosmetics journal. The paper's goal was to congregate information on natural and organic formulation.

Tortini et al said consumers, particularly those born after 2000, are both interested in sun protection products and the environmental impacts of products.

“The formulation of effective and pleasant sunscreen, having a natural, organic, sustainable connotation, is getting a more and more complex approach for the paucity of suitable ingredients,”​ Tortini et al said.

Creating natural and organic sunscreens can be challenging with crossing independent standards, lacking government regulation and effectiveness of UV filters.

Natural and organic certifications

Tortini et al said organic cosmetics and personal care products are projected to be a $54.5 billion market globally by 2027.

Because of a lack of international regulation, brands turn to independent certification bodies, like Cosmos, Natrue and International Organization for Standardization, to set natural and organic product criteria.

The private certification bodies and ISO have different approaches to defining natural and organic personal care and cosmetics products. While ISO 16128 is a clear international standard, Tortini et al said cosmetic formulators find it confusing and a “step backward” from existing private standards.

“The general criteria established by private certification bodies do not focus on the products themselves but involve the entire cosmetics sector in a project of sustainable development and social responsibility, having as their object the maintenance of the balance of our planet,”​ Tortini et al said.

The research team said cosmetics formulators and brands have to balance raw materials, finished products and packaging to achieve natural, sustainable and organic products.

Physical UV filters preferable, not perfect

The most important active in suncare products is the UV filter. Filters can either be organic or inorganic, also known as chemical or physical respectively.

Tortini et al said while organic filters are effective, they also pose a few sustainability issues. Some are believed to degrade and become persistent and toxic in water environments.

Resent research has also found organic UV filters may be irritating for some skin. Tortini et al said considering these issues, along with possible petrochemical origins, inorganic filters are generally considered better for natural suncare products.

The research team also assessed inorganic UV filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Zinc oxide is a less efficient filter than titanium dioxide, but when combined they can be an effective UVA and UVB sunscreen.

Tortini et al added that inorganic filters which include nanoparticles could be more effective, but may also pose a safety risk, as they are insoluble and bio-persistent.

Balancing natural formulation, sunscreen sensorial experience

Consumer interest and media pressure are pushing cosmetic formulators to create more natural and sustainable sunscreens, which Tortini said can often headbutt with needs of human and environmental safety, as well as requirements for making a pleasant and effective product.

One of the biggest challenges may be achieving a high SPF with inorganic filters, which can become thick, tacky and hard to spread.

""It is difficult for the formulator to orient his choice, risking formulas that are overloaded with filters, that are difficult to spread and that do not meet the compliance of consumers,""​ Tortini et al said. ""This may lead to the final result of lower use of the sunscreen product.""​

The need to formulate around these sensorial qualities is important in sustainable sunscreen formulation if inorganic filters are being used. The current perception that organic filters may be toxic make solving this issue in inorganic filters essential, Tortini et al said.

Greenhouse Gas Into Tailormade Proteins: Meet String Bio,"Multiple startups are applying innovation to address various aspects of sustainability and pollution, and creating new-age products with multiple use cases. Read about some key companies here

F





At String Bio, “When we started, the core idea was better tools for bio engineering,” says Subbian. That evolved into an ambition for a full-stack biotech company.





It took her five years or so—and along the way Vinod Kumar, her husband, switched careers from networking and telecom gear at Juniper Networks and Alcatel-Lucent, to build String Bio—and multiple failed attempts. By 2019, String Bio was ready to start commercialising a ‘single cell protein’ ingredient produced from a proprietary gas fermentation technology, which forms part of what they call the String Integrated Methane Platform.





The process uses a microbe to turn methane, a greenhouse gas that is wasted if not used, into tailor-made proteins. The protein has multiple applications, including in animal feed , human nutrition, agriculture, and sustainable, non-toxic cosmetics.





In addition to the animal feed, String’s commercial products now include a ‘bio-stimulant’ brand named Impakt for horticultural crops and oil-yielding crops.





Beyond the bioengineering, “these guys are thinking of a new way in which manufacturing can happen, addressing many issues of climate change,” says Ritu Verma, co-founder and managing partner at Ankur Capital, one of the investors.





“India has opened up a lot more to scientific innovation, both at the government level and in the market, but it takes a lot more effort to convince investors, especially, to come along on the ride with something like this. It’s very tough,” says Subbian.

This growth is primarily triggered by the uncertainty about developments in oil prices. Solvent producers have concerns regarding the developments in oil prices in the future. For some green & bio-solvents, cost reductions have been achieved by using cheaper feedstocks, scaling up the production, or both. The two factors that are expected to have the greatest impact on the future growth trajectory of green & bio-solvents are oil prices and levels of government support. The impact of both factors is heavily dependent on energy prices and the cost of biomass feedstock inputs.

Bioalcohol is the largest green & bio-solvents type of green & bio-solvents market.

Bioalcohols led the green & bio-solvents market, in terms of both value and volume, in 2021. This is due to the increasing use of bioethanol, biomethanol, biobutanol, and biopropanol in various applications, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and industrial & domestic cleaners.

The market for all green & bio-solvents declined in 2020, except bioalcohols, in terms of both volume and value. This was due to COVID-19 and the low usage of green & bio-solvents in applications, such as paints & coatings, and cosmetics. The demand for bioalcohols, such as bioethanol and biopropanol, increased significantly due to their usage in industrial & domestic cleansers, hand sanitizers, and surface sanitizers, among other bio-solvents, which led to their growth in 2020, in terms of both volume and value.

Industrial & domestic Cleaners is projected to be the fastest growing application of the green & bio-solvents market in terms of value during the forecast period.

Bio-solvents are used in the cleaning of high-precision mechanical parts, for instance, such as ball bearings. For this application, perfect cleaning is necessary for the proper functioning of the mechanical piece (remaining dirt would damage the metal) and is critical to the safety of machines in the working process. The stringent regulatory environment existing in regions like Europe and North America to replace petrochemical-based solvents plays an important in the growth of the green & bio-solvents market. The increasing demand for green & bio-solvents from the industrial & domestic cleaners segment is driven by environmental & regulatory pressure to use greener solvents for cleaning applications

Asia Pacific is estimated to be the fastest growing market for green & bio-solvents during the forecast period.

Asia Pacific is projected to be the fastest-growing market, in terms of value, during the forecast period. Asia Pacific has extensive biomass resources, feedstock, and access to markets. The ASEAN region is becoming an attractive hub for production as the global green & bio-solvents industry is slowly scaling to a commercial level, driven by corporate partnerships, private investments, government support & incentives, and innovative technologies. Asia Pacific has become a key region for the green & bio-solvents market and their precursors. This is due to various developments undertaken by companies such as Purac, PTT (Thailand), India Glycols Ltd.

The detergents industry rediscovers the cleansing power of plants,"Green chemicals are rapidly making headway in the detergents sector, with established companies and new startups alike innovating with plant and microbe alternatives

Detergents are a section of the chemical industry where bio-substitutes for petrochemicals are being adopted at a rapid rate. Europe is the largest market for renewable detergents and 50 percent of the estimated 3 million tons of surfactants made there are bio-based. The switch to bio is largely thanks to the EU’s Regulation No 648/2004 restricting fossil products in industry.

The move towards renewable, less toxic, and biodegradable detergents is welcome for a number of reasons. Found in almost every kitchen and bathroom across the developed world, it is easy to forget just how hazardous these ubiquitous toxins are. Even at highly diluted concentrations, synthetic detergents have been shown to disrupt the shape and function of human lung cells.

Detergents are also a major driver of environmental pollution. The most dramatic evidence of their eco-toxicity can be seen in places like India’s Ramuna river, where detergent run-off from homes and factories lather into waves of noxious foam. Made from non-biodegradable petrochemicals like ethylene and prolylene – substances that cannot be broken down by naturally occurring microbes – they linger in the water, afflicting fish with gill damage and blindness. The phosphates, sulphates, nitrates, and chlorides they contain encourage toxic algal blooms and bio-accumulate through the food chain.

The rise of synthetic detergents

As with many important chemical sectors today, the detergent industry’s love affair with fossil-based ingredients began in the early 1930s. Between 1931 and 1932, Proctor and Gamble and Germany’s Feinwaschmitte marketed the world’s first synthetic surfactant-based detergents in quick succession. Uptake for Proctor and Gamble’s new product was slow until World War II, when the US Navy needed a detergent compatible with sea water. P&G’s formulation fit the bill, with ingredients capable of bonding to water-borne minerals. Indeed, one major advantages of the new synthetic cleaners was that they worked even in hard water areas.

P&G’s military contract gave them a springboard into the post-war consumer market, which quickly embraced the chemical innovation. Over the 1950s, rising disposable incomes and the entry of women into the workforce boosted the popularity of synthetic cleaners. These mass-produced chemicals became emblems of middle-class comfort alongside the new labour-saving technologies they were used to clean, like automatic clothes washers and microwave ovens. Aggressive marketing campaigns by the detergent companies further raised the profile of these powerful new cleansers and by 1957, synthetics had captured 90 percent of the American detergent market. Petrochemical-based detergents remain among the most commercially successful creations of the chemicals industry ever.

The importance of surfactants

It is ironic that substances we depend upon so heavily for daily health and sanitation are among the most damaging to living bodies and ecosystems. However, it was not always so. Before the 20th century, people cleaned clothes and surfaces with salt blocks of fatty acids, better known as soaps. These simple concoctions were formed through a heat reaction that combined animal or plant fats (coconut, palm, whale oil, or meat industry by-products) with wood ashes or caustic soda as cleansing agents.

Green chemical companies are now returning to biological compounds to replace hydrocarbon feedstock in their detergent formulations. Increasingly, consumers and industry are finding that these alternatives can offer equally effective cleaning performance as some synthetics. This is because almost all soaps and detergents derive their cleaning power from a class of chemicals called surfactants, a substance that can be derived from natural organisms.

Surfactants are one of the most important and widely produced industrial chemicals in the world, with applications beyond detergents in everything from cosmetics to agriculture. Although a lion’s share of global surfactants is still derived from fossil fuels, the natural world is replete with it. So much so, in fact, that they occasionally become visible as floating foam on the surfaces of rivers and lakes – the products of surfactants secreted by living organisms into soil and waterways. Unlike their recalcitrant synthetic cousins, natural surfactant pollution is unperfumed and usually appears after storms when watery agitation whips up low concentrations into visible bubbles.

Surfactants harbour two key properties that make them practical stain removers. First, they lower water surface tension, allowing liquid to flow into and out of small, dirt-ridden spaces. Another is that they form peculiar molecular structures that powerfully draw out dirt and oil. Surfactant molecules consist of long water-repelling ‘tails’ attached to a water-attracting ‘heads’, a chemical dualism that is critical in removing otherwise insoluble stains. When surfactants reduce water surface tension to a critical point, these molecules coalesce into rings called micelles where the water-repellent tails point inwards and the water-attracting heads face outwards. The inner tails capture solids, syphoning them away into the centre of the molecular globule. At the same time, the water-attracting heads pull the now solid-filled structure towards the watery elements inside the detergent solution. The result is a stain-free surface.

Plant-based bio-surfactants

Plants make many different classes of biosurfactants, but saponins are the most highly prized. Sapopins come in different chemical forms and are found in more than 100 families of vascular plants like Liliaceae, Dioscoreaceae, and Agavaceae, as well as in some marine plants. These chemicals produce a soapy lather when agitated in water, are non-toxic and biodegradable. Although some researchers have found they perform better than synthetics on cleaning performance, saponin has not so far been successfully commercialised. A joint research project between Unilever and the University of Edinburgh are currently developing potential manufacturing methods.

Phospholipids are another plant surfactant class, a substance found in the mucus exuded by the roots of certain species. The plants benefit from root phospholipids because they alter the chemical properties of nearby soil particles and reduce the surface tension of soil water droplets. These mechanisms increase the nutrients available to the roots and are also what makes these substances so effective at stain removal. Unlike saponins, phospholipids are already common on the biosurfactants market, particularly in the form of lecithin. 95% of commercial lecithin is made from degummed soy, with other sources being rice, canola, cottonseed, palm, corn, and sunflower oils. Saraya Co Ltd., which produces eco-friendly cosmetics and cleaning agents, is a key supplier.

Many of the large established bio-surfactant companies use cultivated plants as feedstock for their products. However, the latest entrants are experimenting with waste feedstocks to establish a circular supply chain. In 2020, Seattle-based stirrup Sironix Renewables raised a total of $1.8 million to scale its detergent product Eosix®, which uses surfactants drawn from the sugars in agricultural waste. Its formula was discovered at the University of Minnesota while researchers were investigating potential industrial compounds within plant biomass. Sironix says it can be used to replace oil-based chemicals in shampoos, detergents, and cleaning products.

Microbial biosurfacants

Bio-surfactants need not come from plants. They can also be mass-cultivated inside microbes such as Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, and Candida. Grown within bioreactors, which feed on and metabolise substrates like alkanes, oils, sugars, or bio-waste. Surfactin, a lipopeptide surfactant that can be fermented with the bacterium B. subtilis, is widely regarded as one of the most powerful biosurfactants ever reported in literature. Researchers are currently working out cost-effective ways to scale. In 2021, a publication reported fish waste as a potentially cheap and effective substrate for the organism.

Microbial fermentation will be key to maximising the sustainability of bio-surfactant production. It dramatically cuts down on land use compared to plant-based surfactants, which often depend on environmentally destructive monocultures in cash crops. This especially applies to palm oil, currently a major biomass source for the biosurfactants industry.

Widely commercialising fermented biosurfactants however remains a work in progress. The process is far more sophisticated and less optimised than plant extraction. One of the most costly aspects of making commercially viable fermented biosurfactants is the isolation and purification process, where the target chemical is removed from the microbial broth after the growth period is complete. Cost reduction will also depend on genetically engineering bacteria for increased yield productivity.

Despite these challenges, the fermented biosurfactants industry is displaying marked activity. Manchester-based startup Holiferm uses yeasts naturally found in honey to produce a natural surfactant called sophorolipids. Their product is 100 percent biodegradable and comes in high and low foaming versions for use in cosmetic creams, surface cleaners, shampoos, and conditioners. Holiferm recently entered an exclusive cooperation partnership with major German chemicals company BASF to develop fermentation-derived ingredients for personal care, home, and industrial uses. In 2020, BASF itself launched a new fermented sophorolipid -based surfactant for the Asian market under the brand name BioToLife.

Evonik, one of the world’s largest green chemical producers, launched a fermented plant-based surfactant in 2015. Also in the sophorolipid class, their product was quickly adopted by Ecover, now one of the most visible bio-based cleaning brands in supermarkets. Evonik also produces another bio-surfactant type, rhamnolipids, made through fermenting sugar using a genetically modified pseudomonas putida bacteria. Unilever’s Chilean dish soap brand Quix uses this ingredient. In January 2022, Evonik announced it will build a multi-million euro plant in Slovakia to scale their new rhamnolipid biosurfactant, a plant large enough to dramatically bring down the market prices of its sustainable substitutes.

The science of effective microbial surfactant fermentation is an active area of research, with a particular focus on strain selection for maximising yields. In 2020, the EU research consortium Marisurf ended a 5-year, €4.8 million project investigating bio-based surfactants from marine microbes. The project started with 500 candidate marine microbes, whittled these down to two productive strains. The team worked with industrial partners such as Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant VZW and EcTechSystens to scale production. The chemicals that resulted received positive feedback from end-user companies Marlow Foods, Apivita, and Nanoimmunitech, indicating clear commercial potential. The tech is now awaiting investment for industrial scaling.

Although bio-based detergents are not yet price-competitive with petrochemical synthetics, further climate targets legislation would rapidly change the market calculus. Of the 17.6 million metric tons of surfactant consumed globally, around 34.61 percent goes into household detergents, making this a segment where growing consumer concerns around the health and environmental impacts of everyday chemicals is primed to galvanise significant industry shifts towards bio-substitutes.",,[],[]

Beauty and Wellness Briefing: How Milani is grabbing beauty lovers’ attention,"Readers, I’m back! Big thanks to Emma Sandler and Liz Flora for taking over the beauty and wellness briefing these last few months. I’m looking forward to connecting with all of you, and if you have thoughts, ideas or questions, or want to riff about all things beauty and wellness, please email me at priya@digiday.com. –Priya

At this point, we all know beauty brands would be remiss if they don’t somehow tap into cultural moments — especially internet conversations. And as Liz Flora reported in May, for the last two months, social media was enraptured with the defamation trial between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, which ended last week. Beauty brands got caught in the fray, including Milani and L’Oréal Paris, the latter of which counts Heard as an ambassador. Dior also was modestly entangled due to Depp starring in Dior Sauvage fragrance campaigns, with its searches and sales increasing, according to WWD.

In contrast to the household heritage names that are L’Oréal and Dior, Milani is a 20-year-old indie brand. Found at Ulta Beauty, Target, Walmart and Walgreens, Milani is an affordable brand best known for serving diverse consumers. But tapping into this sensationalist Depp-Heard moment was just a small part of a much bigger Milani strategy that has been building for more than a year.

After a first stab at internal transformation in 2018, following private equity firm Gryphon Investors’ majority stake investment that May, Mary van Praag, formerly of Perricone and Coty Inc., was named as Milani CEO in 2020. Shortly thereafter, Jeremy Lowenstein, formerly of Kopari and Coty, was tapped as CMO.

According to Nielsen data for lip, eye and face makeup categories, Milani was ranked No. 9 for the 12-week period ending April 23. And it’s been on an upward swing since the third quarter of 2021. It was also the only cosmetics brand in the top 10 not owned by a conglomerate, except for E.l.f. Milani Cosmetics would not share sales figures, but the brand earned $40 million in 2017, according to the Wall Street Journal, and was valued at $500 million.

The brand has found favor on TikTok, after debuting on the platform in February 2021. Thanks to fans like Mikayla Nogueira, four of the brand’s 2022 launches have gone viral on the platform. That includes its Color Fetish Flora Lipstick, which has approximately 7.3 million total views. Like Nogueira, Rocio Soria (@Rocio.Roses, 1.4 million followers) is a fan of the brand and posted about Milani in her video on $5 and under finds at Walmart. Lowenstein said the lion’s share of Milani’s partnerships are unpaid and organic.

Soria said she discovered Milani on a late-night run to Walmart as a senior in high school. Her love for the brand continued in college: “I was a broke college student and desired so badly to recreate the looks that all the beauty YouTubers we’re doing with ‘high-end’ makeup. Milani made that feasible because their products perform [well].”

Given TikTok’s Gen-Z audience, it makes sense that most of Soria’s TikTok followers are price-conscious. She said they’re largely students and young stay-at-home moms. “[They] don’t have the luxury of dropping $300 at Sephora once a month. They want to achieve the luxe for less look, just like I did,” she said. Coincidentally, Milani’s latest launch, its Fruit Fetish Lip Oils, in January, has been compared to Dior’s cult Addict Lip Glow lip balm. Milani’s version is $9.99, while Dior’s is $35. Milani’s Fruit Fetish Lip Oil collection has seen an average weekly sell-through of 350%.

“We didn’t expect it to be a blockbuster launch, but people picked it up and started posting it on TikTok. There have been over 100 videos made about it, and we can’t keep it stock,” said Lowenstein.

Nailing the mix of TikTok, price and responding to the wants of the multicultural consumer has been big for the brand. Its Color Fetish Lipstick and Conceal + Perfect Cream to Powder Foundation products saw average weekly sales growth of 328% and 201%, respectively, after organic posts on TikTok went viral. Complexion is a key category for the brand, said Lowenstein, as Milani has a wide array of shades in foundation and concealer.

“If you’re watching any videos on TikTok, they are comparing Milani to the likes of Dior, Charlotte Tilbury and Tom Ford, because the quality and innovation are amazing,” Lowenstein said. Milani Cosmetics’ own TikTok channel is mix of user-generated content, beauty tutorials, playful before-and-afters and callouts to retailers. It has 1.4 million likes and 162,000 followers. Its bio reads, “Diversity is in our DNA. Luxe for all.”

Granted, makeup sales have rebounded industry-wide. In the first quarter of 2022, beauty’s biggest category, makeup saw a 22% year-over-year jump in revenue, to $1.8 billion, according to NPD Group. Lip products, where Milani has a foothold, grew the fastest within makeup: 44% year-over-year. Still, Lowenstein emphasized that Milani is not trying to be a dupe brand. “We’re democratizing beauty; you don’t have to shop at a premium retailer to have the best product.”

And certainly, the beauty consumer believes that more than ever. If you look at the success of a brand like E.l.f., its turnaround, buoyed by the promise of better products at mass prices, is still holding true. Its latest earnings report from late May showed that E.l.f. Beauty delivered better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter and year-end sales for 2022. While the regular Dior or Tom Ford beauty consumer may not trade down from every luxury product, they’ve already traded down on some.

“The beauty shopper has gotten smarter,” said Stephanie Wissink, managing director of consumer research at Jefferies, noting that the same high-low trend of ditching designer denim for Zara and H&M is becoming more ubiquitous in beauty.

With inflation high and worries of a recession rampant alongside deep investment dollars behind it, Milani is well prepared to nab more consumers.

“Milani is poised to continue its social virality and growth trend as consumers make discerning choices during challenging times without having to sacrifice on quality,” said Lowenstein. “Milani women do not want to compromise.”

OASA to Build Indonesia’s First Bio Propylene Glycol Plant,"Protech Mitra Perkasa (OASA) and Sojitz ink a memorandum of understanding in Jakarta on May 23, 2022. (Photo Courtesy of Protech Mitra Perkasa)

Jakarta. Protech Mitra Perkasa, also known by its ticker symbol OASA, recently announced its plans to invest $50 million to build Indonesia’s first bio propylene glycol plant.

OASA will build the bio propylene glycol plant on Java island, with construction works expected to start in 2023. The plant, once built, will be able to produce about 30,000 tons of bio propylene glycol a year.

Bio propylene glycol is widely used across many industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food, and chemicals. According to Protech Mitra Perkasa president-director Bobby Gafur Umar, the company’s entry into the chemical industry is in line with its commitment to the green industry.

“This also aligns with the government’s commitment to a green economy,” Bobby said in a press statement on Monday.

Indonesia entirely imports its fossil-based propylene glycol, as there is still no domestic production of the said chemical, according to Bobby.

Glycerol —a byproduct of biodiesel production— is the main ingredient of bio propylene glycol. Bobby went on to say that Indonesia actually has a huge potential as a bio propylene glycol producer.

“As we know, biodiesel is also an oleochemical industry that produces glycerol, [and it is] an industry that is growing at a very rapid rate in Indonesia. So there is an abundance of glycerol for bio propylene glycol,” Bobby said.

OASA will also work with Japanese general trading company Sojitz.

“Sojitz will be one of our partners, particularly as a distributor, because of its experience and a vast network in selling this kind of product. They are also ready to be the offtaker,” Bobby added.

On Monday, OASA and Sojitz inked a memorandum of understanding on this cooperation. Sojitz will supply crude glycerin and refined glycerin, while also distributing the bio propylene glycol.",,[],[]

It is therefore by studying models and strategies that have been proven in nature for millions of years that Seqens found the avenue that led to the creation of Phyt’Anim Grains of Paradise.

In this case, the source of inspiration of the cosmetic ingredients manufacturer were some particularly fascinating doctors: gorillas of Africa’s western lowland! Thanks to a database of plants used by animals to treat themselves, Seqens Cosmetics has indeed identified the consumption by gorillas of seeds of the paradise plant (Aframomum melegueta) [2] as a means to protect themselves from myocardium inflammatory disorders.

“This plant protects the myocardium of the gorilla by fighting against certain inflammatory disorders (via the COX-2 pathway) that cause fibrosing cardiomyopathy (Dybas and Raskin, 2007). Research has shown that for the captive primates, lack of access to grains of paradise led to a sharp increase in this pathology (Ilic et al., 2014),” said Seqens Cosmetics.

Aware of the importance of this same COX-2 pathway at the level of skin inflammation, Seqens Cosmetics thus studied the effects of this seed on a new skin model to extract the most effective anti-inflammatory fraction, enriched with 6-gingerol.

Relieving skin in a state of chronic inflammation

The active ingredient developed makes it possible to relieve irritated skin and accelerate the resolution of chronic inflammation, whether on an in vitro, ex vivo or clinical scale.

“By readjusting the balance between pro-inflammatory mediators (COX-2, IL-22, FPR2) and anti- inflammatory mediators (IL-10, TGF-β), Phyt’anim Grains of Paradise helps to reduce the visible signs of skin inflammation,” claims Seqens.

The double-blind clinical study, carried out vs placebo on irritated skin, thus highlights a significant effect of the ingredient both on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) after 24 hours, and on redness and vascular intensity after just 5 days.

The role of taste receptors

The company also wanted to understand how primates select plants in their environment. Taste receptors are crucial in signalling to the animal the presence of useful molecules. This is particularly true for the gorilla whose diet is essentially herbivorous.

Noting the surprising presence of these same taste receptors on the skin, Seqens Cosmetics has therefore evaluated the impact of Phyt’anim Grains of Paradise on this relatively unexplored skin axis. According to the company, the results obtained prove that the active ingredient modulates the expression of a G protein associated with a taste receptor during inflammation. “These new data open the way to understanding the role of these receptors at the skin level and demonstrate the importance of considering them in dermo-cosmetics,” concludes Seqens.

Other cases of self-medication behavior, in species other than primates, are currently being explored at Seqens in order to give birth to a new generation of bio-inspired cosmetic actives.",,[],"['Meiyume Develops Exclusive Halal Sun Care Formulation For Carasun', 'Makeup Brushes', 'How To Go Even Further In Designing Eco Products Of Tomorrow']"

Rainbow Six Siege introduces new Squad Up program,"Rainbow Six Siege's new operation is around the corner, so let's look at the incoming features players will experience. One of the most anticipated new updates is the Squad Up program. But does it live up to the hype?

Read more: When will Operation Vector Glare Test Server be released?

What is the Squad Up program?

The Squad Up program is a reward system that rewards players who have already played Year 7.

To be eligible to get these special cosmetics, a player must play 5v5 matches with up to four teammates who were inactive during Year 7.

This includes players who have never played Rainbow Six Siege and also those who already have the game but have yet to play Year 7.

What rewards are included in Rainbow Six Siege's Squad Up program?

Rainbow Six Siege's Squad Up program rewards players with non-duplicate operators and exclusive cosmetics. If you already own all operators, the pack will contain Battle Points instead.

The idea behind the Squad Up program looks very promising. It urges already established players to invite friends to try out Rainbow Six Siege or to just give it another chance. After playing five matches, teammates will receive a Year 4 or Year 5 operator — not only does the leader get rewards but also its teammates.

At the same time, the new players can join the Squad Up program as leaders once they have played five matches into Year 7. That amount is enough to make them eligible to obtain the leader rewards, which are arguably better. The leader rewards include Year 6 operators, and also an exotic weapon skin for Ash's R4C.

Is Squad Up a good addition to Rainbow Six Siege?

Free operators and exclusive cosmetics should always be a yes and be welcomed with a great smile. This is a great system that rewards players with cosmetics and more by getting new players to the community.

There's a twist though.

Although this is a great start and a wonderful idea, the rewards might be a bit too weak. Many players in the game already own all the operators in the pool. Giving battle points instead of operators in case these are all already owned, it just doesn't feel right. Battle points shouldn't be the solution, nor Renown — although that would make more sense.

Rainbow Six Siege should work on a better reward system, including more cosmetics. So, a cool idea would be giving out an exclusive cosmetic instead of going for the comfortable, lazy option, which is just handling battle points. Players who constantly play the game will probably see these as not very useful since they probably complete the Battle Pass with not much effort.

Overall, great concept, poor execution. A bit too lazy, but the idea is there. The R4C cosmetic looks insane, too. Rewarding leaders with more of these might be a better idea though.",,[],[]

Pura H&W Portfolio for The European Union

The derma-cosmetic products are registered at the cosmetic products notification portal (CPNP) which allows them to be commercialized over the counter as cosmetic products in every jurisdiction within the European Union.

Derma-Cosmetic Clinical Studies

Three cosmetic clinical studies were completed on Avicanna’s Pura H&W formulations targeting cosmetic factors associated with aging, acne-prone skin, and eczema-prone skin. The successfully completed studies involved 156 patients that were tested for safety and specific derma-cosmetic endpoints, including hydration and excess oil production. All three studies achieved positive results in the endpoints with no adverse effects, making Pura H&W one of the only cannabinoid consumer lines with human safety and efficacy data. For more information, please see www.Clinicaltrials.gov Registry.

About Pura H&W

Pura Health & Wellness (Pura H&W) is Avicanna’s derma-cosmetic line which utilizes a combination of purified CBD and other synergistic botanical ingredients designed to naturally regulate and nourish the skin. The Pura H&W product line was developed by Avicanna and specific products have undergone clinical trials. The products are now commercial under Pura H&W or Pura Earth in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, the U.S.

The Pura H&W formulations have been developed and optimized to deliver purified, THC-free CBD in synergistic combinations with other natural ingredients known to provide specific functional benefits in skincare. CBD has been shown to promote skin health by inducing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic responses that could be beneficial for a variety of dermatological conditions such as eczema or atopic dermatitis. In addition, CBD can down-regulate the activity of cells that are critical in the production of skin oils and therefore may dampen the production in acne-prone skin.

Izzy Cosmetics Offers Refillable Mascara Solution,"Izzy, the US-based cosmetics brand now offers products in a refillable stainless-steel tube that can be returned, cleaned, and reused.

Izzy’s portfolio features two products, Zero Waste Mascara BLK, and Zero Waste Glossy Lip Butter. Founded with the intent to offer consumers zero waste and carbon neutral beauty products, these are certified as carbon neutral in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol and designed specifically with the refill model in mind.

“Our medical-grade, stainless-steel tubes are designed to be cleaned and refilled over 10,000 times, so you literally never have to throw them away,” explained Shannon Goldberg, founder of Izzy in an interview with Packaging Europe.

All purchase options come with a 90-day supply of mascara, which comes in a Zero Waste Reusable Shipper with no outer packaging, with consumers expected to use it to return their empty mascara tube to the company for cleaning. While some of the product packaging does use plastic, this is apparently reground and recycled at Izzy’s processing facility.

“Approximately 90 days after your purchase, we’ll email you a reminder to send your empty Izzy back in your reusable shipper,” Goldberg adds. “Members receive a sterilized and refilled mascara every 90 days.” Izzy’s Glossy Lip Butter follows the same purchase and refill processes.

“Izzy’s holistic approach to product development is rooted in our closed loop supply chain, carbon neutrality, clean performance-driven ingredients and material reduction. All of our manufacturing takes place within a 400-mile radius, which means that our carbon emissions from transportation alone are exponentially lower”.

Some have suggested that the cleaning process, which can be water and energy intensive, and involve detergents that could have harmful environmental impacts. However, Goldberg notes that “the water from our patent-pending antibacterial cleansing process is reused, rather than dumped into the ocean”.

Overall, Goldberg states that Izzy’s mascara “has a 78% smaller carbon footprint after 25 refills. The more our mascaras are reused, the smaller our relative carbon footprint becomes over time.

“All they have to do is enjoy their product and send it back 90 days later. Izzy is automated to help save time based on a process our customers can trust.”

To incentivise consumers to engage with the refill model, a subscription is cheaper over time than a one-off purchase. A $30 restocking fee is also applied to dissuade consumers from discarding empty mascara tubes or the reusable shipper.

When addressing future portfolio expansions, Goldberg said: “our caps will ultimately fit on all cosmetic tubes for future launches, but the tubes themselves will change in diameter and length. Currently, we have 3 tube shapes that can satisfy multiple product types.”

“Ultimately, our plan is to create a super pared-down minimalistic line of beauty essentials that people feel good subscribing to,” Goldberg concludes.",,[],[]

Chapman’s first marriage was to La Fonda Sue Darnell, with whom he had two daughters, Duane Lee Chapman II and Leland Blane Chapman. Zebadiah Chapman, Wesley Chapman, and James Robert Chapman are his three children from his second marriage to Ann Tegnell. Lyssa Rae Brittain, an American businesswoman who is also known as a housemaker and is known as “Big Lyssa,” was his third wife. The union, which took place in the Colorado Mountains in 1982 and ended on November 20, 1991, was allegedly performed by a Native American chief.

His fifth marriage was to Alice Elizabeth “Beth” Barmore, with whom he had an on-again, off-again relationship before they married on May 20, 2006, at a Hilton hotel in Waikoloa Village, Hawaii, after an on-again, off-again relationship.

Dog the Bounty Hunter: Professional Career

Chapman made world headlines on June 18, 2003, when he apprehended Andrew Luster, who had left the United States in the midst of his conviction on charges of drugging and raping many women. Luster was found guilty in his absence on 86 counts, including multiple rape charges stemming from offences in 1996, 1997, and 2000. Chapman had help from his “hunt squad,” which included his son Leland and Tim Chapman.

Luster was apprehended by the three bounty hunters in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where he had been staying under a false identity. They were stopped by Mexican police on their way to California and still in Mexico, and all four of them were arrested. Luster’s identity was verified by police, and he was apprehended.

Chapman was featured on Take This Job, a show about people with odd jobs, after decades of bounty hunting. This prompted him and the show’s production company to create a spin-off about his attempts to apprehend bail fugitives, specifically Chapman’s pursuit of Max Factor cosmetics heir Andrew Luster in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

Chapman was filmed for the truTV television series Dominick Dunne’s Power, Privilege, and Justice on August 28, 2003, shortly after Luster’s arrest.

Clariant Launches 100% Bio-based Surfactant and PEG Range,"The Vita products maximize the bio-based carbon content of consumer goods such as detergents, hair and body shampoo, and other formulations.

Clariant has unveiled its Vita 100% bio-based surfactants and polyethylene glycols (PEGs) to address climate change by helping remove fossil carbon from the value chain.

Previously: Clariant Expands Digital Presence

Vita products are based on renewable feedstocks and have at least a 98% renewable carbon index (RCI). The Vita products support manufacturers in maximizing the bio-based carbon content of consumer goods such as detergents, hair and body shampoo, and other formulations.

According to Clariant, it uses 100% bioethanol derived from sugarcane or corn to create ethylene oxide for its surfactants and PEGs. The bio-based material is fully segregated along the value chain from the field to the final consumer product.

Because only bio-based feedstocks are used, the ingredients have lower carbon footprints than their fossil-based counterparts, according to Clariant. The Vita surfactants can help save up to 85% of CO₂ emissions compared with their fossil analogs.

In addition to this green production, these solutions are chemically equivalent to Clariant’s fossil versions, offering the same performance and efficiency to formulators and brand owners. Customers can currently benefit from more than 70 bio-based products and the range will continue to be expanded. In Q1 2022, double-digit kilotons of the bio-based surfactants and PEGs will be available for the worldwide business segments from Clariant IGL Specialty Chemicals (CISC), a Clariant joint venture.

“From the packaging to the many ingredients, a typical consumer product in coatings, personal care, home care, industrial and agricultural applications still uses petrochemicals and therefore fossil carbon,” said Christian Vang, global head of business unit industrial and consumer specialties at Clariant. “Switching to bio-based carbon chemistry remains a big challenge for manufacturers and by launching the Vita surfactant and PEG range we are offering them an important new solution to achieve this.”",,[],[]

The high oil formulation is delivered in a non-greasy fluid format containing natural plant oils, vitamins and antioxidants. The product is said to spread easily, absorb quickly and leave no greasy residue, imparting only a silky-smooth layer of moisture on the skin.

According to Bio-Oil, the moisturizer is lighter than other body lotions yet contains 42% oil—2× the average amount of oil in competitive products. This is possible thanks to its thin emulsion that has a fluid-like consistency in which the water and oil are lightly bound together. To activate the emulsion, the consumer gently shakes the bottle before each use.

India's Biotech Startups Enter Uncharted Territories,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

You're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.

The Indian 'bio-economy' has grown eight times over the last eight years to reach $80 billion, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Biotech Startup Expo 2022 that was held last week. Biotechnology, which employs technology to solve complex human challenges with technology, spans various branches such as animal biotechnology, medical biotechnology, industrial and environmental biotechnology.

freepik

Estimated to make up 19 per cent of the global biotech industry by 2025, the Indian biotech industry currently comprises over 5,000 companies, 4,240 of which are startups. With the pandemic rendering healthcare innovation unusually urgent, biotech startups witnessed a notable boom in the past couple of years, crystallizing especially around vaccine and essential drugs development. But biotech entrepreneurs have ventured into even more categories, expanding the offerings of the industry to include food security, clean energy, therapeutics and industrial processes, among others.

Genomics

In the recent past, many startups have emerged out of the convergence of biomedical sciences with disciplines such as genomics—the study of the complete set of DNA (including all of its genes) in a person or other organism—to enable better disease prevention, enhanced diagnosis, and optimized treatment. Estimated to reach $94.65 billion in 2028, the global genomics market counts within its ambit a few important Indian biotech startups. For instance, MapMyGenome was founded in 2013 to offer customers DNA-based immunity report containing information about vulnerability to certain diseases and most effective drugs and has raised $1 million from investors.

Xcode Life Sciences was founded in 2010 to specialise in personal genomics and preventive healthcare. As per the startup, which has raised $170 million, ""Xcode Life reports are compatible with more than 50 raw data formats including 23andMe, AncestryDNA, Family Tree DNA (FTDNA), Living DNA, My Heritage DNA, and whole-genome sequencing files.""

Bangalore-headquartered Ganit Labs is a not-for-profit, state-funded, public-private partnership initiative in the area of functional genomics and next-generation sequencing. Founded in 2013, Ganit uses DNA sequencing to help pharmaceutical companies to create personalized medicines for diseases such as cancer and diabetes, among others. The startup, which has raised $119 million, claims to have offered more than 500 genetic tests and partnered with 5,500 clinicians across 1,600 hospitals.

Agriculture and Green Power

The Indian agritech market is expected to reach $24 billion by 2025, as per research from EY. With 1,483 startups currently populating the country's agritech industry, many ventures have made a name for themselves. Sea6 Energy, for instance, was founded by four IIT-Madras students and their professor in 2010. An 'ocean operating system', the startup claims to have harnessed the seaweed grown in oceans in a sustainable way to create a range of bioproducts that can boost agriculture, enhance animal and plant immunity and provide an alternative source of energy. It has raised $8.9 million from investors including Tata Capital and Biocon's founder and CEO Kiran Mazumdar Shaw.

In 2018, clean tech startup Solnce Technologies introduced its desalination plant, Sol-Evo, and started a pilot project by installing its standalone unit in a village in Gujarat. Aiming to help rural coastal villages overcome irregular electricity, the company's solar thermal plant has been able to convert 1,500 litres of seawater to potable water every day. In 2020, the startup won the United Nations Development Programme's Innovations award for Sustainable Development Goals.

Industrial Processes

Industrial or white biotechnology is that branch of biotechnology which is associated with industrial processes. It uses microorganisms and enzymes to produce goods for industry, including chemicals, plastics, food, agricultural and pharmaceutical products and energy carriers. The Indian industrial biotechnology (enzymes) market grew to touch around $372.5 million in FY2021, as per BioSpectrum India. Despite the market being dominated by multinational companies such as Novozymes South Asia, Danisco (India), DSM Nutritional Products, etc., the sector's recent expansion has partly been aided by the rise of many interesting startups: Delhi-based Niir Project Consultancy Services (NPCS), for example, offers consultancy services for the manufacture of industrial products such as Ayurvedic medicines, herbal cosmetics, adhesives, sealants, glues, breakfast snacks, bamboo and cane-based products, etc.

Bengaluru-based Kcat Enzymatic is an enzyme/protein engineering group that specializes in providing optimized enzymes for industrial applications. At present, they are working to engineer Transaminase with high Kcat values 800 folds increased activity and stability for industrial production of antidiabetic Sitagliptin, antiepileptic Pregabalin and a specific herbicide. Additionally, founded at IIT-Delhi in 2020, Edna BioLabs produces specialty enzymes for the Indian and global market.

Lumene Pilots Bio-Based Packaging in Best-Selling Moisturizers in Finland,"Lumene is among the world's first cosmetics brands to launch moisturizers in bio-based, biodegradable jars and it is the world's first cosmetics brand to utilize a new biodegradable protective barrier developed for the inner surface of plastic-free cosmetic jars from Finnish packaging material developer Sulapac.

Lumene has worked with Sulapac for the past four years to make advances in sustainable packaging.

Previously, jars made out of biodegradable material have faced challenges with rapid water evaporation. Therefore, it has not been considered for wider use in water-based cosmetics. Lumene's pilot is an investment in the future of the entire cosmetics industry.

With this pilot in Finland, and with the hope of bringing this sustainable packaging innovation to all of its markets, Lumene is forging ahead on its path to inside-out bio-based products. Committed to a circular economy, the brand aims to have 80% of its packaging made from recycled plastics or renewable raw materials by year 2025 and continues to investigate the suitability of various materials for cosmetic packaging.

The bio-based jar is the choice of the conscious consumer, according to the brand. It is made out of upcycled Nordic FSC-certified wood, bio-based and biodegradable biopolymers and naturally occurring clay minerals.

Many of the European Union recycling systems are not yet able to recycle packaging made of biodegradable material, even as biowaste. While the correct place of disposal is plastic collection, mixed or energy waste, brand officials say it is imperative for Lumene to continue developing and launching more sustainable packaging options of the future.",,[],[]

European Patent Office: Cosmetics and detergents ‘innovating most intensely’ in bioplastics,"Published this week, the EPO Patents for Tomorrow’s Plastics: Global innovation trends in recycling, circular design and alternative sources​​ study analysed patenting activity worldwide between 2010 and 2019 across all industries in two areas: plastic recycling and bioplastic technologies.

“Patent information provides robust statistical evidence of technical progress. The data presented in this report shows trends in high-value inventions for which patent protection has been sought in more than one country (international patent filings). It highlights technology fields that are gathering momentum and the cross-fertilisation taking place,” ​the EPO said. ​

“Trends in circular plastic innovation have never been more important to the sector’s development. Therefore, [the study] provides a guide for policymakers and decisionmakers to direct resources towards promising technologies, assess their comparative advantage at different stages of the value chain and shed light on innovative companies and institutions that may be in a position to contribute to long-term sustainable growth.”​

Cosmetics and detergents ‘innovating most intensely’ in bioplastics​

Study findings showed health care was “by far the most active”​ in bioplastics innovation, with more than 19,000 international patent filings over the study period, but cosmetics and detergents were the sectors “innovating most intensely in bioplastics”. ​

For these two industries, the ratio of international patent filings on bioplastics versus conventional plastics was 1:3, compared to 1:5 in health care. And patent activity was coming from some of industry’s biggest beauty and personal care players, with Procter & Gamble, L’Oréal, Henkel, Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Kao Corp and Amorepacific – in this order – holding the top seven global innovation spots in bioplastics for cosmetics and detergents, based on the number of international patent filings. BASF held eighth spot, followed by Shiseido and Dupont de Nemours.

Packaging, electronics and textiles were also “significant contributors”​ to innovation in bioplastics, the EPO said.

Globally, and across all industries, chemically modified natural polymers such as modified cellulose generated “the largest share of patenting activities over the last decade”​ in bioplastics, though polymers from bio-sourced monomers were the “fastest-growing field”​, according to the EPO.

“Bio-based and/or biodegradable plastics show potential for enhancing circularity and reducing the carbon emissions generated by the use of conventional fossil raw materials. Patenting activities in these bioplastics took off in the late 1980s and since then have followed a growth trend similar to that of conventional plastics technologies,”​ according to the study.

Europe and US ‘the main global innovators’ in circular plastics​

Considering both bioplastics and plastic recycling, the EPO study showed that, globally, Europe and the US were leading the charge in international patent filings, representing 60% (Europe 30%; US 30%) of all patenting activity across both sectors. The EPO said Europe and the US were “by far the main global innovators in terms of efforts to make the plastics industry circular”.​

Within Europe, the UK, France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands were considered stand out and specialised in both fields. Findings showed the US led specialisation in plastic recycling innovation.

In Asia Pacific, Japan demonstrated the most patenting activity across bioplastics and plastic recycling, though along with Korea and China, this market lacked specialisation in these fields, the EPO said.

Plastics recycling has ‘highest level’ of patenting activity​

Globally, the EPO study showed patenting activity around plastic recycling was stronger than bioplastic innovations, with chemical and biological recycling methods generating the “highest level of patenting activity”​ during the review period. There were 9,000 international patent filings related to these plastic recycling methods versus just 4,500 on mechanical recycling – “currently the most commonly used solution to transform plastic waste into new products”, ​the EPO said.

“While the patenting of standard chemical methods, such as cracking and pyrolysis, reached a peak in 2014, emerging technologies such as biological methods using living organisms (1,500 international patent filings) or plastic-to-monomer recycling (2,300 international patent filings) now offer new possibilities to degrade polymers and produce virgin-like plastics.”​

And the EPO said almost 20% of inventions around chemical and biological recycling originated from universities and public research organisations, indicating fundamental research played a much more significant role in this space versus other plastic recycling technologies.

Plastic reusability, recyclability and biodegradability – ‘promising new technologies’ ​

Writing in the study’s foreword, António Campinos, president of the European Patent Office (EPO), said these findings not only offered a “unique source of business intelligence”​ for decision-makers in government and industry, it also shed light on how innovation, coupled with regulation and cross-border collaboration, could create a “smarter, more sustainable future for plastic-reliant industries”.​

“…As the European Commission’s Green Deal to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050​ takes shape, helping innovative players to flourish is essential,” ​Campinos said.

In comments to the press, he said: “This study offers key insights into a range of promising new technologies that foster the reusability, recyclability and biodegradability of plastic products. It highlights Europe’s contribution to innovation in this sector but shows that much more can be done to turn pioneering European research into inventions and bring them to market.”​",,[],['Kacey Culliney']

Enzymit Inc. Secures $5M to Advance Designer Enzymes,"The enzymes are used in a ""cell-free"" process, eliminating the problems associated with cellular manufacturing and cutting production costs and development times.

Enzymit Inc., a syn-bio production platform company, announced the close of a $5 million seed round to accelerate the development of its computational design platform to engineer new-to-nature enzymes for bio-production. These designer enzymes reportedly could ""replace nearly every inefficient, unsustainable and polluting chemical reaction used in modern production methods.""

According to the company, bioproduction is challenged by a lack of enzymes and organisms suitable for production; and even when appropriate enzymes exist, cellular manufacturing (fermentation) is beset by toxicity problems, production of side products, sub-optimal enzyme ratios and varying temperature optima, making the development of new production organisms incredibly difficult. Enzymit's approach reportedly eliminates the problems associated with cellular manufacturing and cuts production costs and development times.

Cell-free Efficiencies

Enzymit’s platform technology creates enzymes that can not only catalyze new reactions but also outperform existing enzymes, the company reports. The enzymes are used in a ""cell-free"" process—meaning using the enzymes directly without requiring a living organism (like in fermentation).

""Using clean enzymes without the redundant cellular mechanisms makes the process orders of magnitude more efficient,"" Gideon Lapidoth, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder explains. ""One of our key breakthroughs [is the] designer enzymes don't require ATP, a very expensive molecule which is essential for many natural reactions,"" Lapidoth adds. ""By removing this dependency on ATP, we can catalyze many reactions cheaper and more efficiently than ever before.""

Utility and Applications

An example of how this process might be used for personal care is the production of molecules with desired properties that exist in nature—such as ""rare sugars,"" including the biopolymers hyaluronic acid or chitin—that would otherwise be too expensive or non-sustainable to produce from natural sources. ""Our designer enzymes allow us to cheaply manufacture these products by 'hacking' processes that don't exist in nature,"" Lapidoth explains.

""Enzymit is developing a novel process for hyaluronic acid,"" he continues. ""This product is currently manufactured using fermentation, which is fraught with issues. Enzymit is developing a cell-free process that will dramatically reduce the cost.""

Design and Disruption

According to Lapidoth, the key challenge the company faced in developing the technology was the actual enzyme design part. ""Once you obtain the enzyme with the desired properties the upscaling is actually quite simple,"" he says.

""... The key technological advancement that allowed us to create our new enzymes is our computational algorithms. Enzyme design (and proteins in general) are incredibly complex systems. The advancement of deep learning technologies has had an enormous impact on addressing this insane complexity, making it manageable.""

Enzymit's aspiration, according to Lapidoth, is to disrupt how many of our daily consumables are produced. ""If we are successful, then many of these products will become much cheaper and accessible but without any [of the] environmental downside that usually comes with accelerated development and production.""

Further Developments

Enzymit is also developing an enzymatic process that can convert carbon from the air to novel bio-polymers cheaper than before, and plans to challenge some of the largest players with its innovative platform and products. With this new investment, the company is well-positioned to take on the challenge and significantly impact this critical market.

""While there is no dispute that humanity's future relies on biomanufacturing, if we expect to maintain our standard of living in the face of increasing global pressures and growing population, nature hasn't supplied us with all of the enzymes humanity needs,"" said Lapidoth. ""This is the bottleneck Enzymit aims to solve.""

The current biomanufacturing industry is valued at US $100 billion annually, in light of its potential. According to Enzymit, however, this is a fraction of the $4 trillion global chemical industry it aims to replace.",,[],[]

3D Bioprinted Hydrogel Enables Hair Follicle Regeneration,"The substrate could aid in hair loss treatment and may have broader applications for skin.

Recent research published in Acta Biomaterialia describes a technique to bioprint a gelatin-alginate hydrogel (GAH) that enables dermal papilla cells to regenerate entire hair follicles (HFs). It does so by successfully generating the microenvironmental cues for hair regrowth.

See archived: Immunity to Hair Loss Could be the Future

Fibroblasts (FBs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), dermal papilla cells (DPCs) and epidermal cells (EPCs) were encapsulated in the GAH and 3D-bioprinted into different layers of a scaffold. The scaffold was then transplanted in an animal model.

The substrate demonstrated suitable compatibility and increased the proliferation abilities of DPCs, and the dermal and epidermal cells self-assembled into immature HFs in vitro; these HFs were regenerated in the appropriate orientation in vivo. The authors concluded the scaffold could make a significant contribution in the medical management of hair loss and have broader applications in skin tissue and appendage engineering.

Providing the following overview on behalf of BioInspir is Claude Grison, Ph.D., scientific director for the company and research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).

Feedback from professional perfumers has been overwhelmingly positive, and [highlights] that our products indeed have olfactory nuances not present in their petro-sourced equivalents.""

What is your innovation? How is it used?

Our innovation is ecocatalysis: A new branch of sustainable chemistry based on the use of plant-based catalysts for green and innovative organic synthesis. BioInspir's Ecocatalysts come from the direct recovery of metals accumulated by aquatic plants in their natural environment. They have superior performance and selectivity compared with conventional catalysts currently used in the synthesis of most cosmetic ingredients.

Ecocatalysts can be used in the eco-responsible and bio-inspired syntheses of cosmetics and perfumery ingredients for which only conventional chemistry processes are industrially deployed today. Fragrances such as methyldihydrojasmonate (Hedione) and linalool oxide have been synthesized in processes at the edge of green chemistry, combining efficiency, speed, naturalness and eco-responsibility. However, a wide range of other ingredients is accessible through ecocatalysis.

See related: Green Emulsifiers and Nanoemulsion Stability, A Review

What is novel about it? How might it shape cosmetics and personal care product development?

Using safe, organic and ethically sourced ingredients developed using eco-friendly processes—with a limited footprint—is at the core of BioInspir's model. This approach can be valued in the company's ingredients, as there is high demand for natural cosmetics and for companies developing sustainable processes.

Furthermore, BioInspir's approach for developing what we call an “ecofragrance” is unique. Rather than highly pure components with fewer nuances than the natural alternatives, BioInspir is able to synthesize mixes of fragrances that mimic the molecular dialog between insects and plants: the language of the nature.

Feedback from professional perfumers has been overwhelmingly positive, and [highlights] that our products indeed have olfactory nuances not present in their petro-sourced equivalents. The processes and catalysts used by BioInspir also are compliant with the COSMOS label.

The ambition of BioInspir is to provide highly demanded ingredients in the cosmetics and perfume industry that are currently not available under the COSMOS label.

Where did your idea come from?

As research director at CNRS and scientific director of BioInspir, I (Grison) head a unique research laboratory in France that is specialized in ecological chemistry, a field between chemistry and scientific ecology. Its goal is to take inspiration from nature to develop chemistry innovations to fight against environmental harm caused by human activity.

Through the course of research on the depollution of soils and waters, several vegetal invasive species able to accumulate metals found in their environment were identified. Recovery of these invasive species followed by a simple natural treatment allowed for the creation of Ecocatalysts.

Ecocatalysis is a new field of sustainable chemistry, and despite the fact that my (Grison's) research unit has demonstrated the technical feasibility of ecocatalysis for more than 5,000 molecules over 10 years of research in the field, many challenges needed to be faced and many others still remain to be addressed.

From a technical point of view, developing processes in line with the philosophy of ecocatalysis requires intense research work for selecting the right species, understanding their activity related to their natural cycle, and picturing their use for the synthesis of a given ingredient. From a business point of view, the challenges consist in focusing development efforts with industrial scale-up in mind, which requires a clear understanding of the market demand, the right partnerships for collecting invasive species in line with regulation, and the financial means to invest in a talented team and the innovative equipment allowing the in-house production of molecules.

Tackling these challenges is possible due to the combination of the exceptional technical talent of the research team, along with the deep experience in technology transfer of Technofounders, the venture builder that co-founded BioInspir. Finally, ecocatalysis as a new field is challenging the status quo: it requires energy and determination to convince stakeholders that chemistry should no longer work against, but rather with and for nature to provide long term welfare to our kind.

What outcome do you anticipate from the competition? From your work?

Taking part in the Cosmetic Victories competition was a superb opportunity to showcase some of the potential of ecocatalysis with the development of “ecofragrances."" Ecocatalysis offers a sustainable alternative to conventional catalysis, providing at the same time highly valued ingredients for the cosmetic and perfume industry.

Ecocatalysts make a real difference in terms of eco-friendly processes, environmental impact and respecting biodiversity. Examples include:

Aquatic ecosystem preservation;

Valorization of invasive aquatic species endangering local biodiversity;

Collection of metallic elements dispersed in the environment; and

Using modern methods of chemical synthesis that lead to reductions in energy, waste and carbon impact.

We invite all cosmetic and perfumery players seriously engaged in an ambitious transformation of their processes and products portfolio, toward more environmental friendliness, to connect with us so that we can develop common collaboration projects to help them reach their sustainability goals.",,[],[]
Who Was Estée Lauder?,"Estée Lauder (1908-2004) was an American entrepreneur and co-creator of a cosmetics corporate empire, Estée Lauder Companies (EL). Now in its ninth decade, the company that bears her name is a major manufacturer and marketer of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. Its more than 25 brands are sold in approximately 150 countries, booking annual revenues of more than $16 billion, and it employs in excess of 60,000 people.

In building her business, Estée Lauder pioneered not only a variety of now-familiar personal-care products but also a series of practices that have become standard in the beauty field. She “defined the development of the American cosmetics industry,” fashion trade publication WWD declared in its obituary of her.

Key Takeaways Estée Lauder was an American entrepreneur and founder of the Estée Lauder Companies, one of the largest players in the beauty business.

Lauder started the company in 1946 with her husband and a quartet of face creams; it began to take off in the early 1950s with the introduction of a bath oil that was also a perfume.

Her company’s expansion was in large part due to its launching or acquiring new brands to lure different consumers but keeping them as distinct entities.

Lauder pioneered several practices that are now industry standards, including gifts with purchase, beauty contracts, and designer licensing deals.

When she died in 2004, Lauder was eulogized as the last great independent titan of her field, one who fundamentally shaped the luxury cosmetics industry.



Investopedia / Lara Antal

Early Life and Education

Josephine Esther Mentzer was born and raised in a working-class neighborhood in Queens, New York City. Her mother and father were Jewish immigrants from Hungary and Czechoslavakia respectively. Esther—who commonly went by the nickname Esty, Frenchified to Estée a decade later—attended Newtown High School in Queens and graduated in 1927. As a teenager, she began working with her chemist uncle, who ran a small business concocting facial creams, perfumes, and other skin and beauty products (literally in the kitchen sink at first, later in a lab).



In 1930, Estée married Joseph Lauter (later changed to Lauder), after which she continued to promote and sell her uncle’s lotions. Renaming and repackaging her quartet of products, along with homemade makeup, she began demonstrating them in beauty salons, trying them out on women as they sat getting their hair done. As she put it, while under the dryer, they “had nothing else to do.” Delighted with her new look, a woman would usually buy something.

Estée divorced Joseph in 1939, but the couple remarried in 1942 after she had a change of heart. By 1944, the Lauders were running the beauty concession stands at several salons throughout Manhattan and selling products to out-of-town salons through jobbers. In 1946, they launched Estée Lauder Cosmetics as an official company. The plan was that Estée would lead product development, sales, and marketing, while Joseph managed finance and operations.

The company’s first years

The young firm’s first big break came about a year later: The swellegant department store Saks Fifth Avenue placed an order for $800 worth of lotions, creams, and cosmetics—the equivalent of $10,000 today.

After that, the Lauders closed the salon concession stands and began to concentrate on upscale department stores for distribution. Estée herself would travel to each location to train the store’s sales associates, set up the counters and merchandise displays, do press interviews, and meet customers. She believed strongly in a personal touch (literally—applying lotions and lipsticks to faces) and in word-of-mouth marketing. Her mantra was, “Telephone, telegraph, tell a woman.""

Estée also provided additional products when a customer bought something and generous samples when they didn’t, practices that dated back to the beauty salon days. “I just knew…a gift with a purchase was very appealing,” she wrote in her autobiography, Estée: A Success Story. Such promotional tools also compensated for the fact that the company, which grossed $50,000 in its first year, wasn’t able to afford much advertising.

The gift-with-purchase strategy not only became an Estée Lauder trademark but also grew to become standard practice in the cosmetic industry and is still done today, contributing as much as 30% of some companies' annual sales volumes.

In 1953, Estée Lauder Cosmetics expanded into fragrance, introducing Youth-Dew, which was marketed as a bath oil that doubled as a perfume, encouraging women to use it more lavishly. The first of many scents the company would develop, it was a huge hit, boosting corporate sales to $5,000 a week. By the late 1950s, the company was grossing about $800,000 a year. Youth-Dew’s success not only catapulted sales; it also cemented Estée Lauder as a major force to be reckoned with in the beauty industry.



Notable Accomplishments

In the 1960s, expansion became the name of the Estée Lauder game. The company began branching out in several ways. One was geographic: the Estée Lauder line appeared in department stores abroad, beginning with London’s Harrods in 1960. It expanded its manufacturing facilities, creating three large production sites throughout the decade.

Further expansion had to do with the audience. Sensing a large, untapped market among men, Estée Lauder began developing products for them. First was the fragrance Aramis in 1963. In the next couple of decades, other male-oriented efforts included the fragrances Lauder for Men and Ermenegildo Zegna Parfums. The company also developed a high-end skin care line for men called LAB SERIES, which currently sells four products ""every minute somewhere in the world.""

Able to afford advertising by 1962, Estée Lauder Cosmetics also pioneered the idea of featuring the same model in all of its campaigns—“the Estée Lauder woman.” In 1970, Karen Graham was officially designated as such when she became the first model to sign an exclusive “beauty contract” with the company.

Growing the portfolio

Through these and other initiatives, Estée Lauder Cosmetics started transforming from a company into an empire in the 1970s. Like an empire, it consisted of distinct parts and products that represented a shrewd mix of science and fashion, movie-star glamour and medical innovation, and designer status and all-natural ingredients. The company was able to project many images via its variety of brands. Unlike other cosmetic giants, which pushed a single, proprietary line of products, Estée Lauder Cosmetics (and its chief executive) reveled in diversity and separate lines. “The best way of competing was with two companies, not two products under a parent name,” Estée’s memoir explains.

From the 1960s through the 1980s the company tended to create new brands, which included Aramis, Clinique, and Prescriptives. Launched in 1990, Origins offered another innovative but soon to become standard practice: Along with being sold in department stores, it had its own freestanding boutiques, which added to the line’s “organic,” artisanal aura.



Later, in the mid-1990s and 2000s, the company shifted into acquisitions: Bobbi Brown, Jo Malone London, MAC, Bumble and bumble (hair care), and Smashbox were some of the hot brands it bought. It also made licensing deals with the likes of Michael Kors, Donna Karan, Tom Ford, and Tommy Hilfiger, cashing in on the craze for fashion-designer–created cosmetics and scents.



Many consumers may not realize that their favorite exclusive or artisanal skin care line, such as Dr. Jart+ or Too Faced, is actually owned by cosmetics corporate giant Estée Lauder.

Corporate changes

Leonard Lauder, Estée’s oldest son, became president of the company in 1972. Ascending to the title of chair of the board, Estée began reducing her role in day-to-day operations and decisions. She very much remained the public face of the company, though, making appearances and participating in product launches. For years, Estée Lauder’s ads for a new product carried the tagline, “And only one woman could have created it,” so it was strategic to keep the company associated with Estée and her personal touch, even as it expanded and diversified. Plus, in an era when the women’s liberation movement was in full swing, flaunting a female founder didn’t hurt.

Leonard became chief executive officer (CEO) in 1982. Though her son still often consulted her, Estée further reduced her role—“more queen mother than queen,” as biographer Lee Israel put it in Estée: Beyond the Magic. Still, Estée remained a highly active presence throughout the 80s.

In 1989, the company achieved $1 billion in sales. On Nov. 17, 1995, it went public, holding its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange as Estée Lauder Companies Inc. Debuting at $26.00 a share ($6.50 on a post-split basis), the offering raised more than $450 million. Estée retired shortly afterward with the honorary title of founding chairwoman. When she died in 2004, Estée Lauder Companies was posting around $5 billion in annual revenues.



$2.9 billion The estimated worth of Estée Lauder Companies when it went public on the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 17, 1995—the equivalent of $5.29 billion in today’s dollars.

Wealth and Philanthropy

During her lifetime, Estée became quite wealthy. In the late 1980s, she possessed personal assets worth $233 million. The Lauder family—which currently owns Class A and Class B shares of Estée Lauder Companies’ common stock and 85% of the voting power—has a personal net worth of $40 billion in 2020. Though Estée reveled in the good life—owning and decorating several homes; socializing with celebrities, political leaders, and royals, and traveling and entertaining constantly (she was renowned for lavish parties)—she, the family, and the company contributed substantially to various charitable, civic, and cultural causes.

One of the first actions by the Estée Lauder Companies Charitable Foundation, set up in the 1960s, was to create playgrounds in New York’s Central Park. It has also made contributions to the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art. After Estée’s husband died in 1983, her two sons established the Joseph H. Lauder Institute of Management & International Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.

Perhaps the company’s best-known initiative is its Breast Cancer Campaign, founded in 1992 (and the creator of the breast cancer awareness movement's widely recognized pink ribbon). Through its Breast Cancer Research Foundation, it has funded more than $108 million for global research, education, and medical services to diagnose, treat, and eradicate breast cancer.

Honors and Awards

Estée received dozens of accolades and awards throughout her life. According to her autobiography, the ones she most cherished included:

The Insignia of Chevalier of the Legion of Honor from the French government (1978) for contributions to restoring the Palace of Versailles

The Gold Medal of the City of Paris (1979)

The Crystal Apple from the Association for a Better New York (1977)

In addition, Harper’s Bazaar named her one of its 100 American Women of Accomplishment in 1967. In 1989, The Wall Street Journal added her to its Gallery of the Greatest: People Who Influenced Our Daily Business list of the century’s biggest business influencers.



Personal Life

Though Estée was firmly at the helm in the early days, she saw her company as a family business. Her husband, Joseph, worked alongside her, running the financial and manufacturing aspects, while she handled creative and marketing affairs. Her eldest son, Leonard, helped out as a teenager, officially joining the company in 1958. He eventually took it over, becoming CEO in 1982 and chairman in 1995, when it went public; he became chairman emeritus in 2009. His wife, Evelyn, and younger brother, Ronald, also played significant roles in the company. As of 2022, Estée’s grandson William (Leonard’s son) is executive chairman of Estée Lauder Companies, and other grandchildren hold significant positions as well.

Estée was justifiably proud of her company being a third-generation enterprise, attributing much of its success to that. When looking back on competitors such as Max Factor, Revlon, and Elizabeth Arden, whose family members failed to step up after the founders passed away, she commented that “the personal love and involvement are gone” from them. “They’re companies now, not a family’s heart and soul,” she said. “It won't happen to Estée Lauder.”

Does the Lauder Family Still Own Estée Lauder? Although Estée Lauder Companies has been a public company since 1995, the Lauder family still owns a considerable chunk of it. Their shares of Class A and Class B common stock comprise approximately 85% of the voting power.

Does Clinique Own Estée Lauder? No. In fact, it’s the other way around: Estée Lauder Companies owns Clinique. It founded the hypoallergenic line, developed with a dermatologist, in 1968.

How Many Brands Does Estée Lauder Have? As of 2022, Estée Lauder Companies owns more than 25 brands, all relating to skin and hair care, fragrance, and cosmetics.

The Bottom Line

Estée Lauder took a quartet of face creams and grew a skin care and beauty empire. A business that in its first year grossed $50,000 was booking $5 billion when she died, nearly 60 years later. And it still thrives today, unlike many of its cosmetic competitors. Corporate rivals such as Helena Rubenstein, Elizabeth Arden, Max Factor, and Revlon were also the brainchildren of charismatic individuals; all are now gone or have been acquired.

Timing had something to do with her success—the post–World War II prosperity and return to glamour that enabled and encouraged women’s discretionary spending on skin care and makeup certainly helped. Still, Estée also had a knack for networking, a keen marketing sense, a ferocious work ethic, and a never-ending inventory of ideas. Several techniques she pioneered or popularized have become widely adopted in the cosmetics field today, including gifts with purchase, beauty contracts, age and gender targeting, stand-alone stores, and designer licensing deals.

She was also able to keep the Estée Lauder Company growing by continuously adding new lines and products, either by creating them or acquiring them. By making them stand-alone brands (or, in the case of acquisitions, letting them stay that way), she was able to appeal to a variety of consumers and capture different markets without muddying any messages or images.

Admittedly, much of the company’s expansion occurred under the management of Estée’s children, particularly Leonard. Still, that is a result of her ability to instill a love of the family business in subsequent generations and know when to hand over the reins. Although an outsider, Fabrizio Freda, is currently president and CEO of Estée Lauder Companies, other Lauders continue to play active roles, including Estée’s grandchildren.

Estée Lauder was “the last great independent titan of the cosmetics industry,” as The New York Times characterized her. Small wonder, then, that upon her death, WWD announced, “An epoch has ended.” Its obituary quoted Jack Wiswall, president of the Designer Fragrances Division at rival L'Oréal as saying, “Estée changed the whole landscape. She put the bar so high that everybody else had to play catch-up.”",,[],"['Troy Segal', 'Troy Segal Is An Editor', 'Writer.

Expanscience: a prebiotic active from kapok tree to boost sexual well-being,"Officially launched during the latest edition of the in-cosmetics Global show, Calybiota Bio [1] is a natural extract rich in polysaccharides, obtained from the calyx of red kapok tree (Bombax costatum) flowers, sustainably sourced in Burkina Faso, West Africa.

Intimate area hygiene and care

Calybiota Bio is particularly recommended for the intimate area hygiene and care. A clinical study has demonstrated its protective role on the vaginal flora, revealing a prebiotic effect on this flora’s lactobacilli, together with a reduction in inflammation and in discomfort sensations. It helps soothing and moisturizing the intimate area and improves women’s sexual life.

The new ingredient is also recommended for acne-prone skin, skin prone atopy/eczema or hypersensitivity, as well as for deodorant formulas.

Sustainable harvest

Calyxes - the part located at the base of the flower - of the red kapok tree are traditionally used in African dishes to bind sauces.

Flowers are collected in the classified forest and biosphere reserve of the “Mare aux Hippopotames de Balla” in the Satiri district, which is part of the UNESCO’s ""Man & the Biosphere"" program. Local communities have been trained in good harvesting practices and a field study has been performed in order to assess the environmental and social impact of the supply chain.

Laboratoires Expanscience also participated in the construction of the cooperative’s headquarters (warehouse, office, and meeting room) in the Balla village.

From an environmental point of view, enhancing the local value of the red kapok tree is of high interest. Indeed, the red kapok tree is an oxalogen tree, meaning that it has the ""oxalate-carbonate pathway"" in its metabolism allowing it to form calcium carbonate in the soil, “one of the most sustainable forms of carbon sink,” highlights Expanscience.",,[],"['Meiyume Develops Exclusive Halal Sun Care Formulation For Carasun', 'Makeup Brushes', 'How To Go Even Further In Designing Eco Products Of Tomorrow']"

Cosmetic Claims Put to the Test at NYSCC Suppliers' Day,"The first full day of conferences and conversations at NY SCC Suppliers' Day, held May 3-4, 2022, reiterated several relatively established trends in cosmetics R&D, e.g., sustainability, transparency, proven efficacy, safety, etc., as expected, but also underlined the critical need to substantiate those claims with solid science.

This was apparent from both exhibitors, who shared insights in terms of the certifications or criteria customers expect raw materials to meet (notably COSMOS, USDA Biopreferred and UEBT), and from the conference program, featuring a two-part session across two days on in vitro modeling to predict clinical outcomes.

In vitro Testing

Part one of the conference session covered topics including genetically engineered 3D skin models; testing the skin’s innate immune response in vitro and non-invasively; bioequivalence efficacy testing for sunscreens; solutions from in silico and in vitro testing to clinical bioanalysis and imaging; sensorial evaluation in cosmetics and the integration of the sensory neurons in in vitro models; and in vitro studies of skin deposition and permeation and their practicality.

See related: 7 Years in the Making: CE Recommends In vitro SPF Double Plate Test Method

Eduardo Ruvolo, director of clinical and scientific affairs at Beiersdorf, addressed SPF testing, including the complexity of getting reproducible results using different test models. ""[Using ISO 2444], the higher the SPF, the higher the standard deviation and variability of the data,"" he said. His talk also stirred audience interest in what the point is at which raising the SPF level provides negligible differences in protection. He emphasized there are various biological factors to consider, but that the ideal cut-off could be somewhere in the range of SPF 25-60.

Microbiome and Skin Longevity Biomarkers

Another conference session focused on the industry's latest darling: the microbiome. Topics ranged from topical probiotics and deciphering skin longevity biomarkers, to myths and facts about the skin microbiome, a citizen science approach using a kit to collect consumer data, skin microbiome personalization and more.

Martin Baraibar, CEO at OxiProteomics, explained that chronological and biological age can differ remarkably, and since skin is subjected to a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic insults, this difference could even be further pronounced. The design of dermocosmetic interventions targeting the root causes of aging may therefore help to slow skin structure and function decline by keeping ""healthy"" skin.

To achieve this, however, he noted that the identification of reliable biomarkers of skin longevity is needed, pointing to distinct signatures of biomarkers (i.e., specific proteins from different anatomical compartments or organelles) that have been observed upon skin exposure (in vitro and ex vivo) to different types of stress.

Microbiome-friendly Certification

Also under the microbiome umbrella, Kristin Neumann, of MyMicrobiome AG, explained that an imbalanced skin microbiome causes irritation and makes skin more prone to skin diseases like psoriasis, acne, eczema and dermatitis. ""We really need to be aware of what we are feeding our microbiome,"" said Neumann, highlighting the poor modern-day diet.

In contrast, a well-balanced skin microbiome is essential for health and, by extension, beauty. She described an independent certification for microbiome-friendly cosmetics and personal care products to give scientifically valid data for microbiome related claims in the cosmetics industry. According to Neumann, claims that products nurture or rebalance the microbiome are difficult to prove due to the diversity of the microbiome as well as individuals. She believes microbiome-friendly is the better claim. ""It's easier to prove that a product doesn't harm the microbiome,"" she explained.

Day Two's testing topics will range from delivery modeling techniques; scalable in silico simulation for total body exposure using in vitro transdermal and respiratory tract permeability assays; in vitro model challenges for skin lipid measurements in the clinic; 3D bioprinted full skin models with Immunization, pigmentation, vascularization and oil functions; diabetic skin and its modeling to improve skin condition; and tissue engineering from normal to compromised skin.

Sophim's Biophytosebum Acts as Natural Alternative to Silicones,"Characteristics of Biophytosebum are shinier, more easily spreadable and is reportedly as smooth as a volatile silicone, and less greasy than a film-forming one.

Sophim has debuted Biophytosebum (INCI: Olive Oil Decyl Esters (and) Squalene), a vegetable-derived active emollient. The ingredient can act as a natural alternative to silicones, as sensory testing demonstrated.

Biophytosebum was assessed in a blind comparison with two grades of silicones, i.e., dimethicone and cyclopentasiloxane, whereby eight criteria were examined by a panel of 12 judges. The products were applied to the forearms and evaluated under red light to eliminate bias due to slight color differences. The sensory properties of each were rated on a scale from 1 to 10.

Biophytosebum rated above average for shine (~7.5/10), spreadability (~8/10) and softness (~7/10) during and after application. In addition, it was less greasy than film-forming silicone. Further, the ingredient provided a naked skin touch.

According to Sophim, silicones such as dimethicone are not biodegradable and present possible environmental issues. In addition, cyclopentasiloxane is being monitored for its potential action as an endocrine disruptor. As such, Biophytosebum is offered as a bio-based alternative that is COSMOS-approved and available in an organic version.",,[],[]
BeautyStat Cosmetics Is Now Available at Ulta,"Every now and then, a beauty brand comes along and stops the internet in its tracks.

BeautyStat Cosmetics is one of those brands that definitely falls into the ""game-changing formula"" category. Here's some good news to boot: It's now available to shop at Ulta.

Founded in 2019 by cosmetic chemist Ron Robinson, BeautyStat produces a range of products with science- and data-backed efficacy—and they have a legion of fans across Hollywood and social media alike to prove it. Robinson has over 20 years of experience in the industry creating products for Clinique, Revlon, and more, so just know that his own line of products has to be good.

Bieber's favorite product from the range is also its most popular: the Universal C Skin Refiner Serum (opens in new tab). In a video posted to her YouTube channel back in February, the model claimed that the serum has been an absolute game-changer for her skin. ""It has changed my skin,"" Bieber said in the video. She also counts herself as a fan of the Universal C Eye Perfecter (opens in new tab), which she said that she uses on a daily basis.

The serum was the first of its kind in that it features 20 percent vitamin C, which means that it leads to brighter, more even skin. It also contains squalene, which helps with hydration, so your skin looks plumper overall. The patented formula is even designed not to oxidize on the skin, which means that it delivers maximum potency from the first application. And, as we know, higher potency delivers faster, better results.

Another one of Bieber's favorites is the Universal Pro-Bio Moisture Boost Cream (opens in new tab), which she considers to be an ""amazing, every-day, all around, solid moisturizer."" That's high praise coming from Bieber, who counts some of the most expensive and exclusive beauty products on the market to be a part of her beauty routine.

But the five-star reviews don't begin and end with Bieber. Hundreds of videos featuring the brand's hashtag on TikTok have racked up 6.9 million views and counting, with some users claiming that it has become a staple in their routines after just two weeks of use. Others have noticed that it fades the look of their acne scars and dark spots. And while the Refiner is a bit of an investment at $80, the thousands of reviews and visible results don't lie.

Why 'bio' and 'green' don't mean what you think,"""These claims make us feel better about our overconsumption, our consumerism,"" says Duncan. ""But the reality is that we should all be buying less.""

Then there's the fact that most consumers are not in a position to fact-check these claims and look into the details. ""We have to rely on the claims made by brands because we don't have the time, the resources or the expertise to check and verify them,"" says Holtbrügge.

In a survey of 7,500 adults around the world by the Capgemini Research Institute, almost half believed that they did not have the necessary information to verify the sustainability claims on products, and 44% said they did not trust these claims.

The same language is often used in legitimate and misleading climate claims, making it very difficult for the consumer to distinguish between the two, says Segev.

She discovered this when she carried out an experiment for a 2020 study. Together with other researchers, Segev selected an advert for storage freezer bags and created two versions: one which complied with the US Federal Trade Commission's Green Guides and featured substantiated, clear claims, and the other which featured the same claims, such as ""manufactured with 25% less plastic"", but without substantiation.

Participants were unable to draw a distinction between the two and rated the misleading advert as less deceptive than the legitimate version. ""It was only when we gave them guidelines on how to spot greenwashing, that they could detect the difference,"" says Segev.

Seele says consumers have a responsibility to call out greenwashing. ""The less people speak up, the more likely we will have even more greenwashing,"" he says.

But given all these pitfalls, how can consumers avoid greenwashing?

Be wary of vague claims that aren't backed up or green packaging and labels, which don't provide any further information, says Duncan. Consumers can also use websites such as the Ethical Consumer to find out more about a brand's sustainability record. ""It goes behind the scenes in every area and is a good way to get to grips with products,"" she says.",,[],['Isabelle Gerretsen']
Kao Announces Recycling Initiative,"Kao has announced a recycling initiative in collaboration with Jeplan aimed at material recycling of plastic cosmetics bottles using Jeplan’s chemical recycling technology. The company is undergoing field testing to recycle used cosmetic bottles collected at Twany retail outlets run by Aeon and color studio cosmetics retail outlets in Aeon malls. The collection period will run from February 1, 2022 to July 31, 2022.

Cosmetics bottles with color printing and decoration are typically difficult to recycle into PET material to produce new containers.

The initiative started in June 2021, when Kao began using chemically recycled PET material that had been manufactured by Jeplan to make bottles for Twany brand cosmetics, confirming that the recycled material could be used to manufacture beautiful packaging with an equivalent level of quality to those made from virgin PET material.

Kao plans to expand the range of brands that can use the chemically recycled PET material and increase the scale of collection, with a goal of social implementation of the material recycling of plastic cosmetics bottles as soon as possible.

Participating brands include Twany, DEW, freeplus, L’equil, suisai and more.",,[],[]
