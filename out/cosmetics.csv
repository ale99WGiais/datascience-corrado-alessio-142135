Halo comes to Fall Guys with new Spartan Showdown cosmetics,"You better believe it - Halo is officially coming to Fall Guys via a range of new cosmetics, including outfits for the Master Chief, a Grunt, a Brute, and a pink Mark IV helmet. If any of these sound at all appealing to you, then it’s only a short wait until June 30, at which point they’re up for grabs.

You’ll have to be quick though, as you’ll only have until July 4 to pick it up in what’s been dubbed the Spartan Showdown. This event also brings with it some limited-time events and legendary items for elite Fall Guys players to go out and collect.

You absolutely need to check this trailer out, trust us!

What’s best about all this is the form in which this announcement came into the world - a recreation of the legendary Halo 3 Believe trailer from all the way back in 2009. This means slow motion shots of explosions (although with colourful pinks and purples rather than any actual danger), beans playing dead, and of course, the final shot of a Brute holding the Master Chief in one hand and a crown in the other.

It’s all quite funny, as is the norm with Fall Guys which is of course developed by a team who are more than happy to approach marketing their family friendly battle royale with overflowing levelity.

Nonetheless, for those who want to finish the fight on a whole new front, you can pick up Fall Guys for free starting June 21 on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and the Nintendo Switch.

Smashbox Brought Back These Popular Becca Cosmetics Products,"Becca Under Eye Brightening Corrector Reviews

An Ulta shopper said, ""Best under eye color corrector I've tried. Blends beautifully and provides great coverage. I'm a fan and will definitely be using this product on a daily basis.""

A Becca fan shared, ""Have been using this for yeaarrsss. was devastated when I heard Becca was shutting down. Wasn't able to stock up. Then I saw Smashbox owns this product! Yay! Never stop selling this. perfect for no makeup days with a few dabs under the eyes. Amazing under concealer on more glam days as a color corrector. Doesn't pertain to me but love that they added more shades too!""

Someone else shared, ""Game changer! I'm 55 and this product is perfect to conceal some wisdom lines and color imperfections under my eyes and over my upper lip!!""

Another person raved, ""I will probably repurchase this forever. I love the consistency of this. It's so smooth and brightening. I am a tired mom of a 1.5 year old girl. Emphasis on TIRED. This stuff really lifts my under eyes. It's also very forgiving and easy to just tap back out when it starts to crease which is inevitable. I love it!""

A fan of the color corrector declared, ""Best stuff around. I have wasted so much money trying to find something that works. Every cream, concealer and serum out there. I am 46 with awful genetics that keep the dark circles under my eyes. I used this and my daughter, her bf and my husband were like it's an extremely noticeable difference that looked natural and brighter. I will buy again! A little under my eye and a few pats with my ring finger and I don't have to wear anything else. I love it thank you.""

A person shared, ""I use this product daily and it does help brighten my under-eye area and diminish the appearance of my dark circles. The product absorbs well into my skin and looks very natural when worn alone. I also do a light concealer over top of it and the two products together don't look caked on. I definitely recommend this product and will buy it again!""

""I just got this and I'm obsessed. I hate under eye concealer but I have purple/blue under my eyes and like to cover it. I'm all about a natural look and This is just perfect, it doesn't look like makeup but makes me look awake and rejuvenated. I found it super easy to blend on top of my eye cream (Clinique rich). I might even get some for my husband,"" an Ulta shopper reviewed.

This $26 Concealer Is Innovation at Its Finest,"As POPSUGAR editors, we independently select and write about stuff we love and think you'll like too. If you buy a product we have recommended, we may receive affiliate commission, which in turn supports our work.

The Dominique Cosmetics Wide Awake Full Coverage Concealer offers medium to full coverage in 17 shades.

The formula comes with a cooling doe-tip applicator to depuff the undereye area.

One editor tried the concealer and was impressed with the results.

Concealers can be pretty hit or miss for me. I have dark undereye circles, but the issue stems from a lack of volume, not necessarily hyperpigmentation. Therefore, my journey to brighter, more ""wide-awake""-looking eyes means I'm often searching for a product that addresses both skin concerns, which is surprisingly hard to find.

Because of this fact, I'm willing to try any and every concealer on the market, no matter the formula — cream, liquid, mousse — or price. So when influencer Mikayla Nogueira raved about a concealer that had a metal doe-foot applicator tip, I immediately knew I had to try it.

The concealer in question is the Dominique Cosmetics Wide Awake Full Coverage Concealer ($26). It is available in 17 shades, which could definitely use expanding, but promises a radiant finish and medium to full coverage. As someone who loves the dewy-skin look, I couldn't open the packaging fast enough.

The concealer came housed in a normal plastic tube, but as Nogueira mentioned, the applicator is the star of the show. Like others on the market, it has a doe-foot shape. Unlike others on the market, it's not your normal fuzzy-tip applicator that absorbs product before you smear it on. Instead, it has a metal tip that feels cold to the touch, and I could see that the product was sitting on the applicator, which means you won't waste any product during application.

I chose the colors Honey Roast and Chai Latte and started with the former under my entire eye area. The applicator felt fantastic against my skin — if it wasn't for the simple fact that I would be applying entirely too much product to my face, I would have just sat there rubbing concealer under my eyes for minutes. (This probably would have been OK had I not doused it with pigment, since cold compresses can help depuff the skin, but alas.) Still, I reeled it in and applied the amount of coverage I would with any other concealer. Application took some getting used to, and I had to use both sides of the applicator to get as much product as I needed, but other than for a slightly awkward turn of my hand, the concealer applied smoothly and evenly.

Blending it out, I did get that medium coverage that the brand mentioned, but I knew I wanted the area to look brighter, so I also went in with Chai Latte to build up the coverage. This combination gave me the look I was going for and also covered up the darkness without looking cakey or piled on. While the concealer didn't address the lack of volume under my eyes, the cooling effect of the metal applicator did make them look temporarily refreshed. If you suffer from the opposite problem (puffy undereyes), then the cooling applicator will do wonders for you when applying your makeup.

I also noticed some very light texture appear after the formula dried down. While this isn't a dealbreaker for me, if you experience fine lines or slight texture of the skin under your eyes, you may want to set it with a lightweight blurring powder.

Did this concealer change my life? No, but it got the job done and my undereyes looked brighter, which in turn made me look well-rested. Now if I ever have a hard time falling asleep, I'll know exactly which product to reach for in the morning.

Natura's CEO steps down in shakeup at Brazil cosmetic maker,"The logo of Natura is picture at the company headquarters in Sao Paulo, Brazil December 19, 2019. REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli/File Photo

SAO PAULO, June 15 (Reuters) - Brazil's Natura & Co Holding SA (NTCO3.SA) said on Wednesday that Chief Executive and Executive Chairman Roberto Marques was stepping down in an organizational shakeup, handing over the reins of the cosmetics maker to board member Fabio Barbosa.

Natura, which aims to simplify its structure, is also eliminating its sustainable growth officer and chief transformation officer.

Natura shares jumped 7.8% after the announcement, making it the top gainer on Brazil's Bovespa stock index (.BVSP), which rose 1.2%.

It is ""time to evolve,"" said the owner of Natura, Avon, Aesop and The Body Shop brands, with plans to increase the accountability of its business units after years of expansion fueled by high-profile acquisitions.

Barbosa said Natura's main priority with the move was not cutting costs, although calling it ""absolutely important,"" but making its organizations leaner and able to be more agile.

""We also have a focus on the revenue side. ... We know that we have to improve margins, increase revenues and continue to pay attention to costs,"" he told a conference call .

Barbosa served as the chief executive of Santander Brasil from 2008 to 2011, also leading Banco Real for more than a decade and publisher Grupo Abril between 2011 and 2015.

Marques will remain as a board member to help with his succession, but plans to retire at the end of 2022.

Analysts at JPMorgan said the move potentially gives higher autonomy for Natura's business units to execute their plans to deliver the firm's targets.

""In the context of a challenging operating environment and limited visibility on growth and profitability trends, we believe the market is likely to welcome the changes,"" they said.

Natura posted a bigger-than-expected net loss amid surging costs and tepid sales in the first quarter, pushing back by a year some financial targets including net revenue.

Wrapping it up: Catch up on the world of cosmetics packaging,"Packaging is what turns a formula into a product, and it's what's left over the product is gone. That means cosmetic packaging is under the microscope as brands and suppliers try to become more sustainable.

CosmeticsDesign has investigated sustainability accreditation, packaging types and brand innovation. While packaging suppliers meet for an industry trade show, catch up on what's happening in the world of cosmetic packaging.

rePurpose wants beauty brands to think about plastic beyond the recycling bin

Plastic packaging is important in the beauty industry and rePurpose Global wants to create impactful accountability for plastic waste made by personal care brands.

According to rePurpose, 91% of plastic waste doesn’t make it to recycling and ends up in the environment. Svanika Balasubramanian, CEO and co-founder of rePurpose Global, told CosmeticsDesign a major contributor to plastic in the environment is where the plastic in the recycling bin ends up.

Balasubramanian said rePurpose found that roughly 75% of plastic recycled in countries like the US, Canada, the UK and Ireland ends up in countries like India, Indonesia and Vietnam.

“These countries, unfortunately, don't have the necessary infrastructure to deal with their own domestic waste, let alone be this one giant garbage dump for the rest of the world,”​ Balasubramanian said. “That's why we're seeing so much of the waste leaking into nature.”​

RePurpose Global acts as a private industry partner to address the end of the plastic recycling supply chain and works with brands to become “plastic neutral”​ certified. Because plastic is still an important packaging material in CBG, around half of the companies rePurpose works with are personal care brands.

Sustainable packaging roundup: What to keep in mind when choosing non-virgin plastic packaging

More sustainable packaging is on the cosmetics industry agenda, and there are a number of options on the market today.

What qualifies as sustainable varies from market to market, company to company and consumer to consumer, but one of the main goals is to decrease or remove virgin plastic in a beauty brand's packaging.

But, when moving away from virgin plastic packaging, brands have to consider material performance, ease of decoration, transportation costs and logistics, as well as the social and environmental impacts that other materials may have.

Packaging suppliers and sustainability consultants advise companies to do a holistic analysis of how they need packaging to perform, how the benefits and drawbacks of a given supply chain fit into their sustainability goals and what else can be done to improve packaging sustainability, like changing product format or reducing the amount of packaging used.

Below are stories on the four predominant types of non-virgin plastic integrated into the market today.

Refill revolution: Trestique brings refillable, one-stop makeup routine to promote repeat buys

Consumers are less likely to purchase full makeup routines from a single brand, unlike in skin care, but Trestique believes they can change that with strategic plans. © Trestique

Customer loyalty in color cosmetics can be elusive, but a makeup brand built around crayons and sticks has converted to a refillable model to give consumers a reason to come back.

Color cosmetics brand Trestique, based out of New York City, started six years ago built on the concept of a full makeup routine of stick and crayon-format products. Co-founder and co-CEO Jack Bensason said the idea behind the brand was to create a simple, single-brand makeup routine.

While it is common in the skin care market for consumers to purchase a whole routine under a single brand umbrella, Bensason said consumers were significantly less likely to do the same thing with makeup because retailers and brands were more likely to advertise their newest or trendiest product.

“Unlike many other brands, we’re not built around one hero product,” Bensason said. “In makeup, the customer behavior is very different because … the brand never gave them a reason to buy all the products under one roof. Our hero product is basically the makeup routine.”

In order to make that routine successful, Trestique developed a customizable makeup routine, based on what products a consumer wanted and their coloring, which can fit entirely in one small bag.

Prill power: P&G files patent for dissolvable hair care pouches

The personal care major filed an international patent for water-soluble pouches containing dissolvable hair care pellets for a user-friendly, sustainable alternative to bottled and solid formats.

Article by Kacey Culliney​

Personal care major Procter & Gamble (P&G) has developed water-soluble pouches containing dissolvable hair care pellets for a user-friendly, sustainable alternative to existing bottled and solid formats.

Writing in its international patent, P&G said the water-soluble pouches were made from fibrous sheets and could contain one or several types of personal care pellets/prills that dissolved into a creamy product when in contact with hot water. Designed to fit in the palm of a user’s hand, the pouches had been designed to contain prill blends for shampooing and/or conditioning of the hair.

P&G said the invention offered a sustainable alternative to liquid shampoo and conditioner products that contained “significant bulk” with extra water, preservatives and stabilisers, but also an alternative to solid format alternatives that were often associated with poor usability. Many bars or prills, the company said, did not dissolve fast enough on impact with water and others melted during shipping or storage, ahead of reaching the consumer.

“As such, there remains a need for an easy to use, solid personal care article that has a melt point greater than 45°C and rapidly disintegrates into a smooth, creamy, homogenous product upon hydration,”​ the company wrote in its patent filing.

Cosmetics brands performing well in shift to recycled plastic, require wholistic goals for real results

Plastic poses physical and chemical pollution challenges across the globe, and consumer brands make up a large portion of plastic which end up in the landfill. © Getty Images - ShantiHesse

Environmental solutions platform Ubuntoo recently released their 2021 report on corporate plastic packaging goals, with three cosmetics companies or cosmetics-owning multinationals among the best performing.

CosmeticsDesign spoke with Ubuntoo​ Operations Manager Haley Randolph about what the report​ means for the personal care industry.

Can you tell me a little bit about what this report found in regards to plastic packaging?​

We found roughly four categories of goals. Companies were largely creating goals around recycled content, virgin plastic production, collection and recovery, and then recyclability. A lot of companies had recyclability goals that were largely near the Ellen MacArthur Foundation goals​. The highest-scoring companies in our report had maybe three or four of those goals.

What did you find with cosmetics and personal care specifically in mind?​

Two of our top 10 companies were cosmetic companies, so the cosmetic category did relatively well. They are, in our report, classified as high plastic users, and we noticed that high plastic users tended to have higher scores than others, maybe because of the pressure to do so, or maybe because they actually want to make a change.

Sweet dreams: India’s SUGAR Cosmetics edges closer to ambition of going public with latest mega funding,"The Indian beauty brand has raised U$50m in its series D funding round led by L Catterton with participation from existing investors A91 Partners, Elevation Capital, and India Quotient, it revealed on May 31.

Speaking to CosmeticsDesign-Asia​, co-founder and CEO Vineeta Singh, said this latest successful round of funding was helping the firm further its ambitions to become one of the most successful homegrown beauty brands.

“While this journey of making SUGAR as one of the top three make-up brands in India has been phenomenal, I do envision employing more than 10,000 women and a public listing. Getting to that point will be a challenge but we never shied away from aiming higher and dreaming big.”​

The latest injection of funding will help to drive the brand’s growth plans forward. One of its priorities is to further strengthen its retail footprint.

“We also intend to go stronger on our omnichannel approach by simultaneously growing our distribution channels in India and beyond, along with creating an even stronger base on our D2C platforms.”​

SUGAR made its offline debut in 2017, two years after it launched online. Since then, the company has expanded its retail footprint and now has over 35,000 retail touchpoints in over 500 cities.

Despite the challenges that came with the COVID-19 pandemic, the beauty brand forged ahead with its retail expansion plans, launching over 60 stores in March 2020 along. Recently in May, the company celebrated its 100th​ brand-owned store.

Tapping on hybrid trend

In addition, the brand is working to reinforce its product portfolio. At the moment, it is working to capitalise on the trend for more multifunctional, ‘hybrid’ products.

“In recent days, hybrid beauty products have gained momentum as consumers become more conscious of the ingredients in their make-up and demand more from each product. Additionally, the rise of minimalism beauty trends has accelerated this growth.”​

The company has launched new products to cater to this trend, including a primer with skin-plumping ingredients and a skin illuminating sunscreen.

“The beauty industry is ever-evolving and digitisation in the past years has accelerated its growth and ever-evolving trends. SUGAR Cosmetics has always kept the consumer at the core of every decision we make, and our products are developed to cater to their needs,” ​said Singh.

“We look forward to expanding in this hybrid range based on consumer feedback. Keeping our audience in mind, we are also looking forward to tapping into different categories of the beauty industry.”​

Finally, the brand also intends to strengthen its bond with its consumer base and continue building a community.

“We will be focusing on creating solid content to keep educating and engaging our SUGAR community across all platforms – digital and otherwise. We will also be strategically collaborating with like-minded personalities, IPs, and events,”​ said Singh.",,[],['Amanda Lim']
Patent Pick: Unilever Standardizes Pollution Protection Factor for Cosmetics,"There remains an unmet need for a robust and reliable method to standardize the pollution protection factor measurement of any composition for use as a tool to assess/grade cosmetics based on their efficacy.

According to Unilever inventors, while a variety of test methods has been developed to measure the efficacy of anti-pollution cosmetics and cosmetic ingredients, there is no standardized method for this assessment. As such, the company has patented a method to determine the pollution protection factor (PPF) of products.

See related: Wool Powder and Pigments for Pollution Protection, A Proposal

Market Need

As the patent explains, pollutants including particulate matter, black carbon, ground-level ozone and oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur can adversely affect human skin, causing premature aging, hyperpigmentation, the formation of rashes and inflammation, etc. While various cosmetic compositions claim to prevent, inhibit or restrict the particulate pollutants from contacting skin, it is important to be able to substantiate such claims with evidence.

In response, manufacturing companies and academic researchers have developed methods of testing/analyzing or verifying the efficacy of such compositions. However, there remains an unmet need for a robust and reliable method to standardize the PPF measurement of any composition for use as a tool to assess/grade cosmetics based on their efficacy. The present invention addresses this need.

Scheana Shay Named ME Cosmetics Brand Ambassador: Details,"Keeping it real! Scheana Shay has teamed up with ME Cosmetics to normalize conversations about hair loss — and spread the word about the innovative product she’s obsessed with!

The reality star, 37, has been transparent with fans about her postpartum hair loss journey, which began when she and fiancé Brock Davies welcomed their baby girl last April.

Last December, the California native clapped back at internet trolls who criticized how she looked on an episode of Vanderpump Rules.

“To everyone who has commented on my hairline tonight: this was already my biggest insecurity and legit the only thing I usually would facetune,”she captioned an Instagram Story post.

In the days and weeks following, Shay tells Us Weekly’s Stylish exclusively that she got “so many responses” from women who were going through the same thing. (After all, an estimated 50 percent of women experience noticeable hair loss.)

“One of the products that came highly recommended was ME Cosmetics, so I tried it out and it immediately became a staple of my beauty routine,” says Shay. “I was then able to connect with the founder, Camille, and am so honored that she asked me to come on board as an ambassador.”

The TV star swears by the Can’t Stop Me Now Ultimate Coverage Scalp Foundation ($60), which debuted with the brand’s launch in November 2021. “What I love about it is that it’s the easiest application ever,” she tells Us, adding that it’s so simple, “a baby could do it.”

How she applies it? “I put the powder on the brush, then apply it in a stippling motion to the desired area, and just brush it back to fill in my hairline or part. It’s great because it’s water and sweat resistant, so it stays in all day.”

ME Cosmetics launched in November 2021, yet it’s already amassed a cult-following. It was born out of a personal struggle from founder Camille Barreto. “Having navigated androgenetic alopecia since my early 20s, I am acutely aware of the emotional toll hair loss can take on women,” she tells Us.

“However, the fact is that beauty aisles don’t yet have dedicated shelves with products specifically designed to conceal hair loss.” she continues. “As such, a common ‘hack’ many of us have used for years is to adapt products intended for a different purpose such as eyeshadows, root covers, and colored dry shampoos. Unfortunately, these products generally fall short when concealing hair loss as they were simply not designed for this purpose.”

Thus, Scalp Foundation was born. It’s currently available in six colors, but there’s even more in the works. “ME Cosmetics will be launching three new shades this fall: light blonde, dark brown, and silver,” says Barreto. What’s more, dutiful customers like Shay can look forward to a subscription-based loyalty program, too.

EcoWaste Coalition Bares Continued Sale in Manila of Kidney-Damaging Cosmetics with Mercury,"As National Kidney Month is observed this June in line with Presidential Proclamation No. 184, a toxics watchdog group has revealed the continued sale in the City of Manila of skin whitening cosmetics contaminated with mercury that is known to cause kidney damage.

In support of stakeholders’ efforts for better kidney care and for mercury-free cosmetics, the EcoWaste Coalition recently went store-hopping in the Binondo, Santa Cruz, Quiapo and Tondo districts in search of cosmetics containing mercury.

“Our latest test buy operations in Manila have generated fresh evidence confirming the continued proliferation in the city of cosmetics laden with mercury,” said Aileen Lucero, National Coordinator, EcoWaste Coalition, “despite the 2020 global ban on mercury-added cosmetics under the Minamata Convention on Mercury.”

“For better kidney and overall health, we call upon the national and local authorities to step up its action to rid the market of mercury-laced cosmetics,” she added, noting the need to effectively implement the government’s “National Action Plan for the Phase-Out of Mercury-Added Products and the Management of the Associated Mercury-Containing Wastes.”

Out of the 12 products purchased for P70 to P250 each from stores offering cosmetics, herbal supplements and Chinese medicines, nine were confirmed to contain mercury above the regulatory limit of one part per million (ppm) and would be illegal to import, distribute and sell.

Equipped with an Olympus Vanta M Series X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) device, the group detected mercury ranging from 60 to over 26,000 ppm in the samples analyzed, which are among the over 150 skincare products flagged by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for containing mercury and/or lacking market authorization.

Aside from the more visible negative effects of exposure to mercury via skin whitening cosmetics such as skin discoloration, rashes and scarring and reduced skin’s resistance to bacterial and fungal infections, mercury in such products can be toxic to the kidneys.

According to the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), “the kidneys are also sensitive to the effects of mercury, because mercury accumulates in the kidneys and causes higher exposures to these tissues, and thus more damage.”

The EcoWaste Coalition cited a case of the nephrotic syndrome as stated in the World Health Organization’s fact sheet titled “Mercury in Skin Lightening Products” following exposure to mercury through a skin lightening cream.

“One case report describes a 34-year-old Chinese woman who developed nephrotic syndrome, a condition marked by high levels of protein in the urine. Nephrotic syndrome can be associated with a series of complications that affect an individual’s health and quality of life. The mercury levels in the woman’s blood and urine returned to normal one month and nine months, respectively, after she stopped using the skin lightening cream,” the WHO said.

Among the mercury-tainted skin care products found by the EcoWaste Coalition on sale in Manila are: Goree Day & Night Beauty Cream (with 26,050 ppm of mercury), Goree Beauty Cream (25,590 ppm), Feique Herbal Extract Whitening Anti-Freckle Set (7,138 ppm), Collagen Plus Vit E Day & Night Cream (5,977 ppm), S’Zitang 7-Day Eliminating Freckle AB Set (1,398 ppm), Care Skin Strong Whitening & Spot Removing Package (1,204 ppm), Jiaoli Miraculous Cream (967 ppm), S’Zitang 10-Day Eliminating Freckle Day & Night Set (874 ppm), and Xuemeiting (60 ppm).

While negative for mercury, Beauty Girl 6-Day Specific Eliminating Freckle Whitening (Egg White & Tomato) and Yu Dan Tang 10-Day Specific Eliminating Freckle Spot & Double Whitening Sun Block Cream do not have valid certificates of product notification, and would also be illegal to sell locally.

Presidential Proclamation No. 184 issued by then-President Fidel Ramos declares the month of June as the National Kidney Month “to instill consciousness and increase public awareness of the fatal consequences of renal diseases.”

Apex Legends Dataminers Leak Anime-Themed Cosmetics And Bangalore's Prestige Skin,"A prolific dataminer from /r/ApexUncovered, a subreddit dedicated entirely to Apex Legends leaks, seems to have discovered multiple cosmetic skins that may appear in Respawn's popular battle royale sometime this season.

One of the most interesting items revealed by the dataminer appears to be a Prestige skin for Bangalore, complete with a demonstration of the custom finisher that becomes available once the last of the Prestige skin's three tiers have been unlocked. If this leak is legitimate--which it certainly looks to be--Bangalore's will be the first Prestige skin to hit the Mythic Store since Bloodhound's debuted in February.

Also leaked was a set of cosmetics with an anime theme. Among them are an Octane skin that makes the Stimmed-up speed demon look like One Piece's main character, Luffy, a Naruto-themed Wattson skin, and a skin that gives Revenant the appearance of Neon Genesis Evangelion's Eva Unit 09.

There are a multitude of other skins as well, but not all of them are anime-themed, as the leaks include skins from two separate events. The first is allegedly called the Hero Hunter Collection Event, which dataminers claim will launch on June 21. The second event, which contains the anime-themed skins, is reportedly called the Hero Anime Thematic Event, meaning some 400AC Thematic Apex Packs will likely be available in the store, and the event's cosmetics may join the permanent ""evergreen"" cosmetic pool, allowing them to be unlocked via crafting metals or standard Apex Packs once the event has ended.

Thematic Events are often accompanied by an episode of Stories from the Outlands, or a Town Takeover/other themed map changes. The launch date for the anime event is not yet known, though it will likely be somewhat soon, as the files are already available in-game for dataminers to parse. The legitimacy of the leaks won't be known until these events launch, though it is likely that the datamined info is legitimate, as the leaker in question has previously leaked battle pass content and other Apex Legends skins that were later proven to be accurate. Still, players may want to exercise some skepticism until these events are confirmed in-game.",,[],['Claire Lewis']

"Sir John Loved This Indie Brand So Much, He Used the Products On Beyoncé — Then Joined the Team","There's no question that the beauty industry is oversaturated these days. There are a plethora of brands on the market and no sign of things slowing down.

And while it may be easy for a celebrity-backed or -founded collection to make headlines or sell out after going viral on social media, it can sometimes feel like an uphill battle for indie brands. So ensuring you have products that can knock people off their feet is key.

Luckily for CTZN Cosmetics — best known for its universal nude lipstick shades — the formulas did just that, catching the attention of celebrity makeup artist Sir John who has worked with numerous notable stars, including Beyoncé, Molly Sims, and Joan Smalls.

""[CTZN Cosmetics stood out for me because] we share a mission to make sure that we are echoing the sentiments of the beauty community and what their needs are in real time,"" Sir John shares with InStyle. ""One thing I love is that there is this parallel commitment to diversity, to inclusion, and making sure that we are inviting everyone to the party — I think that's the goal. The goal is to make sure that for the people who aren't always championed, we are leaning into what that looks like for them. We also need to make sure that the beauty community sees that and not just how you market to them, but also in the product development.""

The makeup artist was such a fan of the brand that he even used the Nudiversal Kuala Lumpur and Lipstroke Cinco liner on Queen Bey for the 2022 Oscars. Then a few months later, he joined the CTZN Cosmetics family as the Chief Creative Officer.

Here, we spoke to Sir John, about his partnership with the brand, genuine diversity in the beauty industry, summer trends, and more.

VIDEO: Beyoncé Dressed Up Like Barbie in Hot Pink Platform Heels and a Skintight Minidress

A lot of brands these days claim to be all about diversity but often miss the mark, sometimes tragically so. In your opinion, how does CTZN hit the nail on the head when it comes to genuine inclusion?

Genuine inclusion, I believe, starts with not being afraid to have conversations. We are not afraid to have conversations and to be the vehicle for dialogue to happen, so that's the goal — getting in front of the message. Real diversity isn't something that you just wear as an umbrella through a storm, or situational — it's emotional. It's emotional for so many people and so I think that's what we take in. It's that emotional footprint that we want to leave behind and have people think of us for, first.

What do you like most about CTZN Cosmetics' formulas?

I love the payoff [color] first. As a makeup artist, when you give a lipstick to a client or when you're on set, we don't always have time to work something up, or see it immediately. [These lipsticks] go on like velvet with a beautiful texture. They're not a drying matte like we saw a few years ago with all of the liquid lipstick crazes. So it's a moisturizing matte, and actually, even though they are nudes, I do find they are lip-enhancing natural colors. And then the gloss has a beautiful quality to it also, but it's not too sticky or tacky.

Any key products that stand out from the entire collection for you?

I do love the Code Red collection. It's really thought out, with specific attention to complexion, to undertone, to even geographical locations. We are in a space where the global complexion is changing. So in a few years, and even now, we are making new foundations or new colors, and concealers because we are so much more multicultural than we've ever been. One thing that I love is that the reds collection paid attention to that from inception, but the Nudiversal range is always going to be my jam. It was my entry point to even knowing about the brand, and it's why I fell in love with the brand in the first place.

With red carpets back in full swing, what have been some of your favorite makeup looks so far?

Thinking of The Met or Billboards, my favorite look so far is people that are wanting to have fun. I just wrapped Masterclass and I went with the no-makeup makeup look, an everyday look, and an iconic look. And people want to look like something. They want to get dressed up again, they want to feel good. A term I've coined for this look and feeling is what I like to call dopamine glam. I do feel like there is this resurgence into the art of getting ready, but one thing that I think I see everyone taking away from the pandemic is 'skinification'. Since we were so normalized seeing ourselves without lacquering ourselves from forehead to chin for a year and a half, everyone's kinda inching back into what actual complexion looks like and not giving themselves a full beatdown, like a demi beat down with gorgeous eyes and whimsical liner. But I've seen skin looking more like skin, which I love.

What makeup trends do you think we'll be seeing in summer 2022? Any surprises in store? How about even as far as 2023?

I honestly think we are coming away from trends in a sense because it's not so much about doing things to look like one woman or one girl or one celebrity, like we had this prescription in the '90s and 2000s. But now I think it's about how can I get myself ready and it makes me feel something. That's why we are seeing all of these beautiful liners and Euphoria-inspired glam, things that you wouldn't think we would normally do but also the positioning of how we used to go to work changes. A lot of people are working virtually, so we have a creative license to really do whatever we feel and we aren't marginalized by our working, conservative environment. What we are gonna see is just a rush of color, for sure.

How do you think CTZN will change or disrupt the beauty industry as a whole moving forward?

As long as we continue to be authentic and keep our ears to the streets, to basically have the consumer on our radar immediately. The cool thing about a smaller brand is they have the ability to be almost like the David and Goliath story 'cause you can move and maneuver and operate and really hear people in real time and affect change. That doesn't necessarily happen when you have a huge massive conglomerate and change can't be activated 'til two to three years from now when the whole tone of voice from that atmosphere is different. So that's the beauty of what we are doing right now and it's gonna be fun to unpack that with the beauty community.

What are your personal hopes for the brand's future?

The brand has a series they do that I love called Culture-Tutorials. And I love that there is a personal, tribal, or heritage around the way we do makeup. Like, ""Hey, I'm gonna do this glam myself but there is something about the way my mom used to do it, there's something about how my aunt did it in the '80s, or my grandparents are from Pakistan, or Senegal, or Harlem."" Whatever that looks like, and that is something that I want us to snowball and make into a bigger thing, and I think that's really amazing if we can capture that audience to stay in that space. I want us to continue spreading cultural awareness through beauty.",,[],"['Kayla Greaves', 'Kayla Greaves Is The Executive Beauty Editor For Instyle.Com', ""Overseeing The Brand'S Beauty Team"", 'Strategy.

Diablo 4 DLC includes cosmetics and “full” story expansions,"In a surprising turn of events, the eagerly-anticipated RPG game Diablo 4 had a big showing and a Necromancer gameplay reveal at the Xbox showcase – and along with that, the first details on Diablo 4 DLC were revealed, which is “anchored” around cosmetic microtransactions and “full story-driven expansions.”

Just before Summer Game Fest, a job listing for Blizzard confirmed that Diablo 4 would have an in-game store – which the publisher calls “a key component of Diablo 4’s seasonal content strategy.” At the time, though, we could only guess what would actually be in the store, but a number of fans had concerns over microtransactions – especially as Diablo Immortal loot boxes possibly got the game banned from release in some countries.

These concerns were spotted by Diablo general manager Rod Fergusson, who took to Twitter to confirm that Diablo 4 and Diablo Immortal are two very different games, with different DLC strategies. Fergusson states that Diablo 4 is “a full-price game” built expressly for PC and consoles, with support planned “for years to come.”

More specifically regarding DLC and microtransactions, Diablo 4 is planned to be “anchored around optional cosmetic items and full story-driven expansions.” Considering Diablo 3 only had one real expansion, Reaper of Souls, it’s good to hear that Blizzard is planning more than one.

To be clear, D4 is a full price game built for PC/PS/Xbox audiences. We are committed to delivering an incredible breadth of content after launch, for years to come, anchored around optional cosmetic items & full story driven expansions. More details soon. Necro blog tomorrow! — Rod Fergusson (@RodFergusson) June 12, 2022

However, it should be noted that this doesn’t rule out the possibility of other forms of DLC or microtransactions, but we’ll just have to wait and see to find out more.

Diablo 4 wasn’t the only Blizzard game at the event, either, as Overwatch 2 had its release date and confirmation of free-to-play announced too.",,[],"['Chris J Capel', 'Chris Is Obsessed With Fps Games', 'Rpgs', 'Star Wars', 'Comic Books.

"Vegan Cosmetics Market to Reach $28.5 Billion, Globally, by 2031 at 5.9% CAGR: Allied Market Research","Consciousness regarding enhancement of the overall personality and increase in the vegan and vegetarian population drive the growth of the global vegan cosmetics market.

PORTLAND, Ore., June 13, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Allied Market Research published a report, titled, ""Vegan Cosmetics Market by Product Type (Skincare, Cosmetics, Haircare, Others), by Price Point (Premium, Economic), by Gender (Women, Men, Children), by End User (Personal, Commercial), by Distribution Channel (Hypermarkets/supermarkets, Specialty Stores, Online Channels, Others): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2021-2031"". According to the report, the global vegan cosmetics industry generated $16.6 billion in 2021, and is anticipated to generate $28.5 billion by 2031, witnessing a CAGR of 5.9% from 2022 to 2031.

Prime determinants of growth

Consciousness regarding enhancement of the overall personality, increase in the vegan and vegetarian population, expansion of the vegan cosmetics business, and increase in disposable income drive the growth of the global vegan cosmetics market. However, the high prices associated with these cosmetics and the absence of common rules for vegan certification restrain the market growth. Organic and vegan cosmetic products are perceived to be safer than chemical skincare products, therefore opportunities in the vegan cosmetics market are expected to be rising.

Covid-19 Scenario

Owing to the implementation of the global lockdown in the pandemic, the manufacturing facilities of vegan cosmetics were forced to close for a short term, which, in turn, hampered the market growth.

Also, the disposable income of world's population decreased, which reduced the demand for vegan cosmetics products.

Disruptions in the supply chain along with less workforce and decreased raw materials created challenges for manufacturers.

The women segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period

Based on gender, the women segment held the highest market share in 2021, accounting for nearly four-fifths of the global vegan cosmetics market, and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period, owing to wide availability of cosmetics products for women. However, the children segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 7.6% from 2022 to 2031, due to the increasing usage of cosmetic products by children.

The hypermarkets/supermarkets segment to maintain its lead position during the forecast period

Based on distribution channel, the hypermarkets/supermarkets segment accounted for the largest share in 2021, contributing to nearly two-fifths of the global vegan cosmetics market, and is projected to maintain its lead position during the forecast period. This is attributed to rapid westernization trends and emergence of modern trades in developing regions.However, the online stores segment is expected to portray the largest CAGR of 7.8% from 2022 to 2031, owing to the increased association of internet and e-shopping with consumers in developing regions.

North America to maintain its dominance by 2031

Based on region, North America held the highest market share in terms of revenue 2021, accounting for nearly two-fifths of the global vegan cosmetics market, due to the increase in awareness and rise in marketing activities in the developing countries such as U.S., Canada, and Mexico. However, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 7.7% from 2022 to 2031. This is attributed to the increase in westernization and adaption of vegan cosmetic products among consumers.

New Brunswick-Owned Cosmetic Company Receives LGBTQ+ Owned Business Certification,"Reading Time: 3 minutes

Alicia Nicholson, the founder and CEO of Upfront Cosmetics, said owning a business was not the path she planned to take. She got the idea for the business when her first son was born and she was searching for a shampoo that didn’t irritate his scalp.

“I landed on the products that I have now and realized there was a market for them and here we are three years later,” Nicholson told Huddle in an interview.

Nicholson said receiving the LGBTQ+ owned business certification means having third-party verification that the business is owned by someone in the LGBTQ+ community.

“Growing up in a small, rural, New Brunswick community, it really meant a lot of the time I shied away from really expressing who I really was. So getting the certification, I hope that it can show other people that are maybe in my shoes that it’s okay. Don’t think that that’s going to be something that can hold you back and just that it’s okay to live your true self,” Nicholson said.

Nicholson said some larger companies have supplier diversity mandates where they must buy a certain amount of goods or services from minority-owned or diverse enterprises. Upfront Cosmetics having the LGBTQ+ owned business certification will allow them to compete against those larger companies.

The certification is offered through the CGLCC (Canada’s LGBT+ Chamber of Commerce). Nicholson said the organization helps all sorts of businesses not just with certification but also through resources or training.

“Maybe businesses aren’t necessarily owned by someone in the LGBTQ community but want to make sure that they’re inclusive,” she said.

Nicholson said receiving the certification is humbling because she now gets to operate Upfront Cosmetics in the same community she grew up in where she didn’t feel comfortable living her authentic self.

In celebration of receiving this certification and also for Pride Month, Upfront Cosmetics released a limited edition love is love bar. Nicholson said two dollars from each love is love shampoo bar will be donated to the Rainbow Road foundation.

“They are a global, not-for-profit foundation that help anyone in the LGBTQ+ community that’s facing prosecution based on their sexual orientation, sexual gender, or any of those things. It helps bring them to places like Canada or the U.S. where they’re not going to face that same kind of systematic.”

Her business, Upfront Cosmetics, is approaching its three-year anniversary in July. The natural-product business launched after Nicholson did a business accelerator through the Summer Institute program at the University of New Brunswick.

Upfront Cosmetics sells vegan, eco-friendly, paraben-, synthetic fragrance-, and sulphate-free shampoo and conditioner bars, as well as hair masks. Nicholson said each hair care bar replaces two-to-three bottles of liquid shampoo. The bars come with no plastic packaging and are made with all-natural ingredients.

“We’re at this interval time, just as a society, that if we don’t start doing something about plastic waste it’s going to be too late.”

Nicholson said she has found great natural alternatives but they all still come in plastic packaging.

“It was really just about finding something for [my son] and just my passion for environmental justice just went right along with that.”

Upfront Cosmetics has four full-time staff who make the products at a manufacturing facility in Nackawic.

While Upfront Cosmetics doesn’t have its own storefront, Nicholson said her products are sold at 650 different stores across Canada and the United States. Some of these stores include Sobeys, Safeway, Whole Foods Canada, and some independent health food stores.

Halo Infinite developer changes racially offensive Juneteenth cosmetic,"Juneteenth is coming up and some video games are commemorating the emancipation of enslaved people in the U.S. with in-game cosmetics. Among them is Halo Infinite, which offered up a nameplate palette so that you can sport Juneteenth’s colors on your username.

However, the palette quickly came under fire for its name, ‘Bonobo’, which is a species of endangered ape. With a history of apes being used as racial slurs, you can see why people were angry.

Developer 343 Industries responded to say that the name was unintentionally added to the game and actually refers to the name of an internal toolset.

“Thank you for bringing this to our attention,” 343’s community manager said in a tweet reply. “We strive to create diverse and inclusive gaming communities. While the original name refers to an internal toolset, it was not intended to be applied to this content and we recognize the harm it may have caused.”

The nameplate has since been renamed simply ‘Juneteenth’.

Bonnie Ross, founder and head of 343 Industries, also put out a statement on Twitter:

“We were made aware of a palette option for our Juneteenth emblem that contained a term that was offensive and hurtful. The team immediately addressed this issue via an update.

“We are a studio and franchise that is committed to inclusivity where everyone is welcome and supported to be their true self. On behalf of 343, I apologize for making a celebrated moment a hurtful moment.”

How the name passed through every check and made it into the live game is anyone’s guess.

‘It’s a numbers game’: Is the inclusivity movement in beauty all just for show?,"Orcé Cosmetics CEO Shih Yu-Chen was inspired by her experiences as an Asian woman who was unable to find a foundation that matched her Malay-Chinese complexion.

“The message I got at the time was that I should probably whiten my skin so I can find products that would actually work for me. And on the flip side of that I should whiten my skin so I can be considered as beautiful. The signal I got was that there's this parameter – which skin tones are beautiful – and if you're outside of it, then you're not.”​

Speaking to CosmeticsDesign-Asia ​for our latest Indie Pioneers Podcast, Shih said she set out to solve a problem she saw within the Asian community, which was often misunderstood by beauty companies.

“There's really a blank space when it comes to shades, especially for Asian skin tones because there's a common misconception that we are fair enough to just use shades created for Caucasians. A lot of us are fair, but our undertones may not necessarily be the same and that's something that a lot of brands forget.”​

While it is now typical for beauty brands to champion inclusivity today with a wide range of shades, Shih worries that this is all “performative”.​

“The problem with that is the industry rewards those very big brands with a lot of financial backing, who are able to launch out of the gate with 40,50 shades. And it kind of penalises the smaller brands who maybe don't have the budget to launch out of the gate with so many shades.​

“But you know, at the end of the day, are you actually creating shades that are working for the people you are trying to target? I see a lot of brands now launching dozens and dozens of shades and I read the reviews from consumers complaining that none of them really, actually work.”​

Shih described her vision of a truly inclusive beauty market as one with a multitude of brands that serve their own niche group of consumers.

“What I wish to see in this industry is an abundance of niche brands, each catering to a demographic group that they have a specialised interest in, that they have done the homework on, that they understand. Because, you know, the truth is, you cannot serve everybody.​

“Imagine a world where you walk into a Sephora, for example, or any beauty store. And you just know that no matter what your background is, you are going to find a brand that is created for you. That is the world that I would love to strive for.”​

AmorePacific gains momentum in US cosmetics market,"AmorePacific's store at Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York / Courtesy of AmorePacific



By Kim Jae-heun



AmorePacific has achieved notable business growth in the U.S. cosmetics market this year as it is stepping up efforts to reduce dependence on the Chinese market, according to company officials Wednesday.



""North America is the global mecca of beauty products and it is the most important cosmetics market in the world. We have been expanding our business in the United States so as to lower our dependency on overseas sales in China, which accounts for 70 percent in total,"" an AmorePacific official said.

Korea's largest cosmetics market saw its North America sales grow by 60 percent in the first quarter of 2022 from the same period last year. While most AmorePacific-affiliated brands achieved decent performance, it was Sulwhasoo and Laneige that carried the high growth of overall sales in the United States.



""With our luxury beauty label Sulwhasoo and a mid-to-low-priced cosmetic brand Innisfree, the company expanded its business mainly on e-commerce platforms and multi brand shops like Sephora. AmorePacific also increased Laneige's sales by launching a new product Lip Mask,"" the official said.



In the case of Sulwhasoo, it entered 23 new Retro-fit stores operated by Sephora in March to sell its products there. On Mother's Day, May 14, AmorePacific aggressively promoted its serum item, which helped the brand's overall sales in the first half of this year to grow to over 300 percent in the United States. In addition, Sulwhasoo also entered The Hut Group's three major e-commerce platforms Dumb Store, Look Fantastic and Skin Store and launched its official online store on Amazon's beauty channel in April.



""We targeted both on-and-offline channels to boost our sales for Sulwhasoo products in North America while conducting promotional events to give discounts on special days,"" the official added.



AmorePacific's Lanegie brand also entered Sephora at Kohl's store at the time of the country's reopening from COVID-19 in the second half of 2021. Its Lip Mask and Water Bank Cream showed 70 percent and 300 percent sales growth respectively, year-on-year, in the first quarter of this year.



Specific, Lanegie's Lip Mask product has been showing an average of 25 percent of sales growth in the past three years to become the best-selling product in the lip-related item category.

Filipino Cosmetics Company Sunnies Face Enters US Market,"Sunnies Face , the cult-favorite Filipino cosmetics company that fueled Southeast Asian beauty to the forefront of the global conversation, has entered the US market.

Sunnies Face has tapped global beauty accelerator, SuperOrdinary, to launch and manage the brand in the US. SuperOrdinary will manage all aspects of the brand in the US including marketing, e-commerce, communications, commercialization, and go-to market strategy of Sunnies Face in the US and has exclusive distribution rights for the brand in China and the US.

The cosmetics brand will launch its hero product, Fluffmate, an award-winning weightless matte lipstick offered in 15 universally-flattering shades.

“As true beauty lovers, we’d constantly be reaching for what we felt were the best cosmetics products only to be taken aback by the price tag,” said co-founder Georgina Wilson. “Just as importantly, we wanted to ensure that every person who picked up a Sunnies Face product would fine their true match, no matter their skin tone. Many people do not realize that Filipinos account for a wide range of skin tones and when creating these products, it was without question, this would be a pillar.”

Experiencing explosive global success since its launch in the Philippines in 2018, Sunnies Face continues to stand by its brand ethos of “beauty that gets you” by delivering luxury fragrance-, paraben-, and cruelty-free formulations at an approachable price point. Wilson founded the brand with Jess Wilson, Martine Ho, Bea Soriano-Dee and Eric Dee following the success of their eyewear and café businesses, Sunnies Studios and Sunnies Café, respectively. Inspired to create a makeup collection to bridge the gap between artists and everyday consumers, Sunnies Face provides an attainable, yet memorable beauty experience and aspirational products that consumers would be proud to have in their bag.

Sunnies Face arrives in the Philippines to such impressive fanfare that on launch day, the website crashed with shy of 3 million views and had an impressive sellout in 10 minutes at its launch party. The iconic Fluffmatte lipstick has sold nearly three million bullets with one sold every 30 seconds, ultimately elevating them to claim the No. 1 best-selling lipstick in the Philippines.

Fluffmate was the culmination of input from makeup artists who deliberated on 350 colors and 22 formulas.

“Fluffmate holds a special place in all of the founders’ hearts as it was our first product in launching Sunnies Face,” said Ho. “We wanted to create something that was beautifully matte without feeling dry or cracking on our lips, which was the feedback we frequently heard when speaking to consumers about matte lipstick, in general. We poured over countless formulations until landing on the one that strikes the balance of silky smooth, bold color payoff and perfectly matte.”

Despite being out of reach to those residing in the US, the brand has drawn accolades from celebrity makeup artists like Pati Dubroff and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who tapped Sunnies Face in 2019 for an exclusive, limited-edition collaboration with her lifestyle site, Rose Inc.

While Fluffmate will be the first product introduced to the US market, the company plans to release the entire line of cosmetics and skincare throughout 2023. The brand has also partnered with 1% for the Planet, an international organization that empowers companies and individuals to give back to resources taken from the environment. One percent of all sales across Sunnies Face will go directly to 1% for the Planet towards projects and organizations that actively help the state of the planet.",,[],[]
What’s Entailed in Finding Sustainable Makeup and Cosmetics Packaging?,"Understanding what packaging is made from, potential impact of those materials, and finding the right materials has entailed a lot of vetting.

It means deep dives into package designers’ claims and searching for sustainable options that are available at scale and affordable.

Melanie Petschke, a former family nurse practicioner who launched Crunchi Cosmetics, watches for new offerings for smaller packaging components with limited or no sustainable alternatives to plastics.

“When we launched, we thought of toxicity exposure. Cosmetics and skincare products are a hot bed for ingredients linked to cancer, hormone disruption, and other health risks with little to no regulation to ensure their safety. We chose ingredients carefully to avoid these concerns. But we also wanted packaging that would not contaminate the environment through leaching of BPA, BPS, or other toxins,” says Petschke.

While BPA and BPS are banned in many countries, there are no guarantees that material sourced internationally contains none of these chemical substances, still found in some plastic.

An early focus was to incorporate glass containers for liquid foundation and makeup primers – even lip gloss and mascara is in glass now. One downside to glass packaging is increased package weight, so the Crunchi team keeps an eye out for plastic-free, lighter alternatives and uses aluminum and plant-based packaging components with some products.

Some skin and makeup products are sold in post-consumer recycled paper that’s completely recyclable. For paperboard packaging for compacts, it’s meant no longer including mirrors to ensure the material can go in curbside bins.

“We will not launch a product unless we have a way to place it in sustainable packaging. We have put products on hold because we could not justify doing this work [aiming to protect people and the environment] if we have to use plastic—even if it’s post-consumer or recyclable,” Petschke says.

Vetting what’s out there can be tricky. She exemplifies with an eyeliner she wanted to produce in a wooden pencil where she got to the final stage of product formulation, then got a surprise.

“We discovered sharpenable pencil packaging in the U.S. may look like wood and feel like wood but is actually a plastic material. So, we pulled the plug. We ended up starting over with an alternative (aluminum) packaging, at greater than 10 times the cost. A worthwhile investment.”

There’s been other trial and error and tweaking along the way. For instance, the company used to wrap individual products in paper imprinted with information about clean beauty. But in time more filler paper was needed in the shippers to prevent glass breakage during transit. So Crunchi is switching to unit cartons, replacing the educational wrap to allow less fill.

The issue of material availability, particularly with some recycled content, namely glass, can pose challenges.

“We talked to companies who can supply some recycled glass, though presently it’s not offered at large enough scale. But post-consumer glass is on our radar. For now, we look for plastic-free and hope people recycle glass when they are finished with the product so ultimately, we will be able to access more of it,” Petschke says.

Determining how to best package an SPF product has taken some work; glass containers are hardly ideal for poolside. But Crunchi is making headway on this task, having found an alternative for the sunscreen and other lines that involves aluminum.

Samples remain a quandary. Petschke has only found one company offering what it calls a paper-lined with water-repellant material that can go into curbside recycling systems. She’s fact checking the designer’s claims, cautious of greenwashing.

Vetting is ongoing, including around compostability and degradability claims. Crunchi has a plant-based package for finishing powder that Petschke is happy with and she talks of similar promising innovations. But she has no data to confirm it breaks down in the required time to make the assertion.

“We know it’s biodegradable and compostable. We just can’t make the claims without proof of timeframe. We just stick to the term, plastic-free,” she says.

Crunchi also does due diligence around PFAS and is guarded around this topic too. The company invests in third-party laboratory PFAS testing of its packaging and goods to screen for contamination from the manufacturing process. But Petschke says while she is pleased with test findings, current PFAS testing capabilities have limits.

“Crunchi is committed to continued prevention strategies on our part … Unfortunately, this topic is ignored by many packaging and ingredient suppliers, and until there is legislation to hold manufacturers accountable for declaring everything in their products, including PFAS, this will be an ongoing issue for the cosmetic industry.”

Avoiding polymers in many of the smaller components, like mascara wands and caps, remains a work-in-progress, though she has found a way to make brush handles from 99.9% post-consumer aluminum.

With the wands, Petschke encourages customers to donate them to a wildlife nonprofit, Wands for Life, that repurposes them. Still there are no ways to divert and use some components.

“Even if you can take them apart and recycle them municipalities may not have capacity to do it. So, our immediate solution was to partner with CleanHub to sponsor removal of plastic from the environment at a greater capacity than we put it in [to offset our footprint]. Their projects stop plastic from going into the ocean, and they are creating jobs, which is pretty cool,” she says.

To date, CleanHub has diverted 1,190 tons of plastic waste, collecting most near shorelines, from rivers, or oceans.

The company’s biggest challenge is educating the masses that plastic pollution can be addressed successfully, says Joel Tasche, founder and CEO of CleanHub.

“Out of our partners, it is Crunchi with whom we have reached the widest audience. They have a unique distribution strategy and leverage it to raise awareness for our cause.

Their credo, ‘Earth Day is every day,’ sends a powerful message about what they stand for, and the value match with CleanHub makes our partnership a success,” he says.

Speaking of what drives that ‘credo’ Petschke comments, “We wanted to use sustainable, clean packaging for our health and the health of the planet.”",,[],[]
iActive's FeruliShield Feruloyl Glycerides Naturally Provide Photoprotection,"iActive's FeruliShield feruloyl glycerides are natural personal care ingredients that combine the UV-absorption and antioxidant properties of ferulic acid with the formulation advantages of natural oils.

Archived: Formulating Ferulic Acid for Antioxidation

FeruliShield ingredients were developed to improve the performance and formulation of ferulic acid in personal care applications. They are made using a natural enzymatic process that links a ferulic acid moiety to a natural triglyceride such as soybean oil or coconut oil. As modified oils, feruloyl glycerides are more lipophilic in nature and easy to formulate for skin and hair applications.

Feruloyl glycerides reportedly provide long-lasting UV-protective and antioxidant effects, and can enhance the durability (shelf-life), elevate the performance and maintain the efficacy of other active ingredients by protecting against photodegradation. These lipid-based antioxidants can also be used as an SPF booster in sunscreens, cosmetics, anti-aging skin care and hair care products.

FeruliShield products are also USDA BioPreferred certified.",,[],[]

Cosmetic Ingredients Market: Scope

Cosmetic Ingredients Market: Market Dynamics

Drivers: The key factor driving the cosmetic ingredients market growth is the growing demand for natural and organic cosmetic ingredients. Although skin care and hair care cosmetics manufactured using synthetic ingredients are highly effective over the short term, their prolonged use is known to have detrimental effects on skin and hair health. Established vendors in the global cosmetic ingredients market, such as BASF SE and Croda International Plc, are placing high emphasis on expanding their portfolio of natural ingredients.

For instance -In April 2021, BASF SE launched Sacred Patch, a new skincare active ingredient, that boosts emotional well-being and addresses sensitive skin issues. The product harnesses the potential of the valuable algal extract sacran as an active ingredient in skincare cosmetics, focusing on the inner skin.

Challenges: Stringent regulations are the key challenges hindering the cosmetic ingredients market growth. The global cosmetic ingredients market is highly regulated in countries such as the US and Australia and EU member states such as France and Germany.

For instance, the FDA regulates the cosmetic industry in the US under the regulatory authority of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). As per the FDCA, companies, and individuals that are engaged in the marketing and sales of cosmetics in the US have a legal responsibility toward the safety of their products and ingredients. The FDA regulates the production, handling, and labeling of all organic cosmetics. The labeling standards for organic cosmetics are governed primarily by the percentage of organic ingredients in a product. Additionally, the FDA mandates that all cosmetic products must not contain any prohibited ingredients and also lists safety expectations related to the storage and transportation of cosmetics. The implementation of the Personal Care Products Safety Act in March 2019 is expected to further strengthen regulations related to the cosmetic industry in the US. Overall, the imposition of stringent regulations is expected to restrict the growth of the global cosmetic ingredients market during the forecast period.

State Set To Ban Animal Tested Cosmetics — Sort Of,"Seven years after it was first proposed, New York is set to ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals.

A.5653/S.4839 is similar to laws that have taken effect recently in California, Nevada and Illinois that ban the sale or importing of animal-tested cosmetics. The legislation passed the state Senate unanimously and passed the state Assembly 143-2 with Assemblymen Andrew Goodell, R-Jamestown, and Joe Giglio, R-Gowanda, voting in favor.

If a company is found to be in violation of the law, it can face a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for a first violation and no more than $1,000 a day if the violation continues.

“With the passage of this legislation, New York state will become the ninth state in the nation to ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals,” said Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, D-New York City. “It’s often been said that beauty is painful, but that should not be the case for innocent animals. The tests conducted on small animals like mice, guinea pigs and rabbits and others for cosmetic tests are as unnecessary as they are cruel. They subject innocent animals to painful medical procedures, often cause severe physical suffering and death.”

The bill’s text spells out several exemptions that prompted many Republicans to join with Democrats and vote in favor of the bill. The ban doesn’t apply to animal testing conducted as a requirement of any federal or state regulatory agency, if the cosmetic or ingredient being tested is in wide use or can’t be replaced by another ingredient; if a specific human health problem is substantiated and animal testing is needed to evaluate the cosmetic or ingredient; and if there is no other way to test the material other than animal testing that meets state or federal guidelines.

Materials tested on animals can also still be sold in New York if the ingredient was tested on animals before the new law takes effect in January 2023, even if the cosmetic is manufactured after January.

“The bill actually addresses some of those obvious issues by saying this is not a complete ban,” Goodell said. “It’s a partial ban. And so this bill would not, for example, apply if a cosmetic is being tested on an animal as required by state or federal law for safety reasons, if that testing is widespread and there is no alternative of ensuring the product is safe. … With those qualifications I would support it because I think the qualifications are reasonable and meet the appropriate balance between ensuring that our residents can look their best using cosmetics and do so safely without risk of adverse reactions.”

Animal-tested cosmetics already are banned in Europe, India and elsewhere, which means many United States-based cosmetic companies have already stopped testing their products on animals. The real aim of the bans is China, which has a policy requiring that most cosmetics are tested on animals. China’s policy applies to all imported cosmetics, including perfume, makeup and hair care products, according to the Associated Press.",,[],[]

Colour Cosmetics Make a Bold Comeback,"This week, Half Magic, the highly-anticipated beauty brand from “Euphoria” makeup artist Doniella Davy hits the internet, where it will be sure to sell fast with fans of the influential HBO series.

But Davy is betting that the line will draw in more than just makeup enthusiasts copying looks “Euphoria” stars Hunter Schafer and Alexa Demie made famous. Davy believes Half Magic’s highly-pigmented eye shadows, long-lasting glitter gels and neon face gems bundled in cosmic-themed packaging will also appeal to the growing subset of customers experimenting with bolder beauty looks.

“I think we’re in a makeup renaissance right now,” said Davy. “People are embracing colour and glitter, and I want the brand to feel like a giant welcome, with a modern, edgy Lisa Frank vibe to … join us in this weird world.”

After shoppers focussed on skin care during the pandemic and the “no-makeup makeup” look dominated the beauty market for years, colour cosmetics are back. Shoppers are buying products like neon eyeshadows in bright orange and green hues, and trying novelty makeup looks, like eyes speckled with face gems and floating graphic eyeliners.

Makeup is now growing twice as fast as skin care, according to recent sales data from the NPD Group. In the first quarter of 2022, colour cosmetics grew 22 percent, to $1.6 billion, while skin care grew 11 percent. Makeup sales were already on the rebound last year, bringing in $7.1 billion in 2021 and NPD predicts sales in 2022 will far surpass last year’s earnings.

“What we’ve been observing is this return to makeup artistry,” said Larissa Jensen, vice president and industry advisor at NPD. “Reds, yellows, greens [eyeshadows] with bright pigments are doing triple digits and that’s what is helping to drive growth.”

At Sephora, shoppers have been flocking to products like the beauty giant’s in-house gel eyeliners in neon shades, said Brooke Banwart, vice president and general manager of Sephora Collection. At Estée Lauder, MAC Cosmetics has rebounded to perform double-digit growth last quarter, thanks to the sales of pastel eye and lip colours, graphic eyeliners and dramatic mascaras, said Philippe Pinatel, MAC’s global brand president. Sales of blush at NARS are up 30 percent since last year, said Julia Sloan, the brand’s deputy general manager of global marketing. Sales of NARS blush shades like its hot pink Coeur Battant and bright red Exhibit A are soaring.

The bold makeup boom is an opportunity for brands. But experts say that while labels can capitalise on the current appetite with new, brightly-hued product launches, they should be cautious about over-indexing on these products. Instead, they can work with more neutral colours with shimmer to appeal to shoppers who are eager to try brighter beauty looks but don’t want a full “Euphoria” face.

What’s Driving the Shift for Bold

The surge of bold makeup represents a major reversal of beauty trends. In 2019, makeup sales were crashing as consumers flocked to skin care. But now, beauty experts say shoppers snapping up statement heels and sexy dresses are applying the same idea of “dopamine dressing” to their beauty routines.

“I’m all about wearing party makeup to a mid-day lunch now because I missed that part of my style,” said Jessica Cruel, editor-in-chief of Allure. “It feels like it’s time to experiment, which is why you’re seeing high shine, lip liner everywhere.”

Beauty brands are also taking notes from TikTok. While Instagram ignited the rise of dewy, minimalist “no-makeup makeup,” the TikTok algorithm also rewards content with more colour, which has led to the platform inspiring more daring beauty trends like duo-chrome eyelids, and glitter-covered lips. Content with the hashtag #euphoriabeauty has over 2 billion views on TikTok.

“Some of my Coachella looks, where I did ombré pastel and bright orange and pink, really went viral because people are drawn to fun and colour on the app,” said Meredith Duxbury, a makeup artist and TikTok influencer.

Makeup artists and beauty influencers on TikTok gravitate towards bolder, at-times outrageous looks to please the algorithm, Duxbury added. But even if consumers don’t completely replicate a bold makeup look they see their favourite influencer share on TikTok, they’ll incorporate bits and pieces of it. In this case, that’s led to more shoppers experimenting with neon in beauty, Duxbury said.

Bold beauty looks from pop culture are also encouraging more daring looks, whether it’s personalities like Alana Haim and Emma Chamberlain sporting neon eyeshadow or haute couture runway looks from Chanel and Schiaparelli featuring exaggerated graphic eyeliner details. The endless appetite for all things Y2K has also contributed to the resurgence of colourful lipgloss and bright eyeshadows.

How to Capitalise on the Appetite

Beauty brands have responded to consumer demand with new products. Earlier this month, MAC launched Colour Excess gel pencil eyeliners in 12 vivid shades, including blues, pinks, greens and whites in both matte and shimmer. Huda Beauty’s new Colour Block Obsession eyeshadow kits, which debuted last month, come in two options, one with bright orange and purples, the other with greens and glittery blues. Ulta Beauty Collection recently debuted a collaboration with illustrator Steffi Lynn, with eyeshadows in teals, yellows and purples. About-Face, the musician Halsey’s beauty line, has leaned on neon and bright shades of “eye paint” to draw shoppers in.

“[It] is what we’re calling ‘joyful expression.’ Clients are using vibrant colours and textures as a … mood booster,” said Banwart of Sephora Collection. “This shift has caused an increase in ... graphic eyeliners in bright tones, bold lips, and sparkling lids.”

Davy’s Half Magic line is well-suited for this celebratory moment. With a number of glitter-focused products — including “glitter pills,” tubes of sparkly gel that can be worn alone as a shadow or layered onto eyeliner for additional glow, and “light trap,” a high-shimmer highlighter which Davy promises will “twinkle properly in low lighting”— it’s perfect for consumers preparing for festivals or parties.

But in a bid to be approachable to all shoppers, even those not in the neon camp, Half Magic also includes products in more muted colour shades, too. Part of the accessible feel, Davy added, was to make the label, which is selling direct-to-consumer, faceless and not rely on her celebrity coworkers.

Other beauty labels are also employing a similar strategy, selling shimmer products in more neutral colours. Bobbi Brown recently launched more shades for its cream shadow sticks and crushed oil-infused gloss. While they have more shimmer and pigment, the new colours still fit into pink and neutral palettes to appeal to shoppers who might not want too much colour, said Sandra Main, global president of La Mer and Bobbi Brown at Estée Lauder.

Lipstick’s trajectory also points to the need to balance bold with neutral. Thanks to the end of Covid-era mask mandates, lipstick is selling more than it was in 2020 and 2021 — sales are up 44 percent this year, according to NPD data. But it’s pinks, browns and nudes that are benefitting, not bright red hues, said Kate Oldham, senior vice president and general merchandise manager for beauty, jewellery and home at Saks Fifth Avenue.

“We always say [shoppers] pick a feature to stand out, and they aren’t necessarily highlighting eyes and lips at the same time,” she said.

Just as important as inviting shade offerings, Jensen said brands should be debuting makeup products that feel different and innovative enough for shoppers to buy. It’s not just about colours, but also about new textures, gels, and applicators.

“The big mega-pallets are still struggling because there were too many of them,” said Jensen. “Makeup still needs innovation. Excitement only comes from new things.”

Even as brands are already anticipating that bold colours and jewel tones will be the trending beauty looks this fall and holiday season, some say the “no-makeup makeup” look shouldn’t be written off completely.

“While current trends are moving towards colourful makeup … there will always be clients that prefer a minimalist look,” said Banwart of Sephora. “We anticipate continued popularity in products that deliver a natural, lit-from-within glow.”",,[],[]
Study: Common preservative in cosmetics and haircare has outsized cancer risk for Black women,"According to Business Insider, the most recent study on the effect these chemicals have on Black women was presented at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in Atlanta on Sunday. It was part of a study led by a community research project called the Bench to Community Initiative. The project brought together scientists, breast cancer survivors, hairstylists, and community activists to analyze the link between harmful chemicals in Black haircare products and breast cancer, Business Insider reported.

The data analyzed how parabens impacted breast cancer cells in both Black women and white women. It found that parabens not only increased the expression of genes linked to breast cancer, but increased the growth of Black breast cancer cell lines. They did not affect white breast cancer cell lines in the same way at the doses tested.

Data from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation shows that Black women have a 41% higher death rate from breast cancer than those of other races. Additionally, Black women under 50 have double the mortality rate from breast cancer when compared to white women.

Part of this disparity is that clinical studies often under-represent or entirely exclude people of color—especially people of color who can become pregnant. As a result, what appear to be long-established data points are often upended when studies diversify the standard trial demographics. This study appears to be one such case.

""Black women are more likely to buy and use hair products with these types of chemicals, but we do not have a lot of data about how parabens may increase breast cancer risk in Black women,"" Lindsey S. Treviño, the study's lead researcher, said in a press release. ""This is because Black women have not been picked to take part in most research studies looking at this link. Also, studies to test this link have only used breast cancer cell lines from white women.""

According to Afro Lovely, Black consumers spent $54.4 million on hair and beauty products in 2018, making up 85.7% of total spending in the category. The outlet noted that in 2020, the global Black hair care market was estimated at $2.5 billion.

""While this project focuses on Black women, the knowledge we gain about the link between exposure to harmful chemicals in personal care products and breast cancer risk can be used to help all women at high risk of getting breast cancer,"" Treviño said.

This isn't the first study that has linked haircare products marketed to Black women and breast cancer. Last year Boston University released a Black Women's Health Study, which followed 59,000 women. Conducted over a period of 25 years, the study focused on women who enrolled in 1995. According to PBS, the study found that Black women who used hair products containing lye at least seven times a year for 15 or more years had an approximately 30% higher risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer compared with more infrequent users.",,[],"['Daily Kos Staff', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']"
19 best makeup bags in 2022 to keep your cosmetics organized,"Real talk: A woman’s makeup bag says a lot about her. Is it tiny and compact? She’s probably a minimalist. Big and crazy-organized? She wants options but knows what she likes. Is it stuffed to the brim, overflowing with palettes? She really wants options. But finding the best makeup bag — whether it’s a travel case, a big clear one or something more chic — is a job for the experts.

“Working with different clients—or even when working with the same one — you always have to be prepared,” says makeup artist Erika La’Pearl, who works with clients like Cardi B and Ashanti. “No look is ever the same, and organization and flexibility is key. Having the right makeup bag makes it easier to find things, lessens the stress and sets up the day.”

La’Pearl says she keeps a minimum of two dozen products like primer, concealer, foundation, various palettes, as well as brushes and sponges, in her kit at all times. But even if you’re not a professional, your makeup bag might rival La’Pearl’s — and for that, it’s important to stay organized.

“I’m a bag lady and a beauty junkie, so it’s safe to say, I know some good makeup bags,” says Meeka Hossain, a beauty influencer who often travels for work. “I’m one of those people who stuffs their makeup bags into their tote bag and has multiple makeup bags for everything. One for travel, one for skin care, one for makeup, one for hair care and sometimes even one for miscellaneous items.”

Ahead, find the 19 makeup bags experts swear by — and exactly where to buy them.

K-beauty vs eco: Cosmetics industry most significantly impacted sector by post-pandemic demand for greener products,"A total of 409 consumer goods companies were surveyed, of which 19% were cosmetic companies.

More than half (51.3%) of these companies reported that the increasing consumer demand for eco-friendly products has had a large impact on their exports and sales.

In particular, 62.8% of the cosmetics companies surveyed reported that it had significantly influenced their exports and sales. This was just behind fashion (68.4%) and ahead of industries including household goods (53.7%) and food and beverages (53.3%).

More than half (52.1%) of the companies said the changes in demand for eco-friendly products increased after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out.

A majority of cosmetic companies (70.5%) felt that this post-pandemic trend had a significant impact on business, making it the most affected by the post-COVID eco-friendly product surge compared to fashion (57.9%), household goods (51.9%) and food (50%).

The survey revealed that 72% of companies observed that the export performance of eco-friendly products increased by 5% or more after the pandemic.

Responding to the green wave

According to the report, one in three companies had received enquiries about eco-friendly products or requests for greener alternatives from consumers.

Only 26.2% of respondents said they were exporting eco-friendly products. By industry, cosmetics (33.3%) had the highest percentage compared to household goods (31.5%) and fashion (29%).

It said 65.4% of cosmetics companies were responding to the demand for eco-friendly products and that they were doing so by improving on packaging (37.9%), raw materials (24.8%) and production processes (11.8%).

However, 78.4% reported that they were not responding well enough to the eco demands. This appeared to be the case for other industries including fashion (81.6%), household goods (82.4%) and food (80%).

The biggest hurdles facing companies in terms of eco-conscious product development were the high prices associated with increased costs in areas such as research and development (31.2%).

Companies also cited financial support (25.7%) as well as difficulties in obtaining relevant certifications (19.3%) as some of the difficulties.

In light of this, companies requested support from the authorities in the form of financial support (25.7%), support for acquiring eco-friendly certifications (25.2%), marketing support (22.9%), as well as R&D support (15.9%).",,[],['Amanda Lim']
​Is Cyberbullying Behind the Rise in Cosmetic Surgery?,"Image Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Matthew Kelly

""Felt cute, might delete later."" It's the perfect adage for the racked emotions that come with putting yourself out there on the internet — an anxiety that many young people have grown up with. It's no secret that combining social media with the general insecurities of adolescence creates a perfect storm for psychological stress, which has only increased in the last 10 years. Platforms continue to sprout cyberbullies and unrealistic beauty standards, and the ripple effects are now entering the offices of plastic surgeons.

According to a 2017 study published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, ""adolescent bullying may be a key driver of interest in cosmetic surgery."" In the group of almost 2,800 participants ages 11 to 16 who experienced bullying, 11 percent expressed a desire for plastic surgery — especially among girls.

Recently, TikToker Audrey Peters shared how negative comments amplified insecurities around what she called a double chin, ultimately contributing to her decision to go under the knife. ""Obviously, commentary on the internet is super f*cking brutal. And everyone would be like, 'Stop shopping and get your double chin removed,'"" Peters said in an interview with the New York Post. But Peters's choice to speak candidly about what was done and why offers both transparency and inspiration.

Millions of users have taken to TikTok to show off their liquid nose jobs and chin liposuction — creating cosmetic trends along the way. Just a quick search of the hashtag #chinlipo will yield a whopping 60 million views. Surprisingly, the social media trend cycle can be beneficial.

""The sharing and transference of knowledge and patient experiences has helped destigmatize nonsurgical and surgical procedures,"" double-board-certified facial plastic surgeon Akshay Sanan, MD, tells POPSUGAR. ""Patients are more educated than ever before coming in for their consultation.""

Still, it also has downsides. ""When procedures, surgical and nonsurgical, start trending online, they are often requested by patients,"" Dr. Sanan says. So while facial trends may fade in mere months, that bullhorn lip lift might not. Plus, not all treatments are one-size-fits-all. ""My job is to understand patients' goals and to determine whether that look is really truly what the patient desires or if they are being influenced by trends or societal pressures.""

Echoing this responsibility, board-certified dermatologic surgeon Jason Emer, MD, often refers to a lyric from Coldplay's song ""Clocks"": ""Am I a part of the cure, or am I part of the disease?"" Though Chris Martin's early-'00s sad jam probably isn't describing the moral dilemma faced by cosmetic providers, it does offer much-needed introspection.

""A patient that has a selfie that they want to look like is an issue, because it's an altered vision of themselves,"" Dr. Emer tells us. ""But if someone has severe acne scars or a recessed chin and we're changing the entire dynamic of their face, it can change their whole life,"" he adds. Ensuring that patients are making the right decision for themselves in the long term, both physically and emotionally, can be aided by bringing a therapist into the mix — a service that many providers like Dr. Emer are now opting into.

Los Angeles-based therapist Stephanie Anyakwo, LMFT, who works with aesthetic clinics, agrees. ""Providers can speak to patients about the benefits of therapy and the importance of addressing some areas of need in therapy prior to undergoing any cosmetic procedure,"" says Anyakwo, who notes that this doesn't need to put a wrench in your timeline, either. ""There is a misconception that therapy has to be a lifelong process, and that is false. Plenty of therapists provide treatment on a short-term and as-needed basis."" So even a one-off appointment before you commit to surgery can be helpful.

Anyakwo also stresses that ""cosmetic surgery alone does not heal."" If left untreated, the effects of cyberbullying and negative self-images can lead to anxiety, depression, and other stress-related conditions. ""This is where going to therapy or seeking some sort of counseling has a true benefit with healing your emotions, behaviors, and thought process.""",,[],['Hannah Cassidy']
Ashique Chemicals & Cosmetics looks beyond Dr Wash with new launches,"Kozhikode-based Ashique Chemicals & Cosmetics, manufacturers of the premium Dr Wash detergent cake, has launched a range of personal care and hygiene products, including a hand wash, hand sanitiser, dishwash liquid, dishwash gel, dishwash cake, toilet cleaner, liquid detergent and floor cleaner.

“All our existing products have been enjoying high demand without much marketing effort and this speaks volumes about our superior quality and well-established distribution network,” Ashique Thahir, Managing Director, Ashique Chemicals & Cosmetics, said.

The 40-year-old company intends to venture into more categories to meet existing and newer demands, he said.

Dr Wash, its flagship brand, enjoys more than 40 per cent market share among branded washing cakes in Kerala and nearly 10 per cent in other south Indian markets.

“We attribute our strong and increasing brand equity to our unique product features. For instance, Dr Wash is made using pure vegetable oils and enriched with coconut oil. The newly launched dishwash gel is filled with active salt and lime extracts, which cleans faster than ordinary dishwash gels,” he added.

With the new product line, the company is looking at sales of ₹350 crore in 2022-23 and beyond the ₹1,000-crore mark a year later. Besides markets in South India, West Asia and North Africa, the company plans to venture into East Asian and other African countries, Thahir said.",,[],[]
It Cosmetics focuses on women’s workplace confidence in new CSR initiative,"It Cosmetics wants to support women’s confidence at work.

On June 1, It Cosmetics announced a new ongoing corporate social responsibility partnership with The American Confidence Institute to produce video series and blog posts on the topic of confidence. In step, it revealed plans for a microloan program through microfinance company Kiva.

It Cosmetics, founded in 2008 and acquired by L’Oréal Group in 2016, began with the purpose of offering products that allow women to feel confident in their skin, said Kristen Comings, svp of consumer engagement at It Cosmetics. From there, the team wanted to expand its confidence premise and saw an opportunity to support women in the workforce.

“As a brand, [we] built ourselves on wanting our consumers to feel confident in their skin. We use real women in our [photo and video] assets and show their real skin, skin concerns and all. For us now, it’s about [focusing on] how we can take this further and tackle confidence from the inside,” said Comings.

Each month, It Cosmetics will publish two blog posts on its DTC e-commerce website on topics like “How to Be Confident in an Interview,” “The Difference Between Competence and Confidence,” and “What Comes First — Success or Confidence?” They’ll be written by Alyssa Dver, founder of The American Confidence Institute. In addition, videos on similar topics that feature Dver will be released once a month.

It Cosmetics has over 40,000 YouTube subscribers. The microloan program will lend $3 million by 2030 to female business owners, up to $100,000 each. Aside from the $3 million figure, Comings declined to share the brand’s other costs of investments into the CSR program.

“Confidence is not just a buzzword or empowered by someone else’s experience. It’s a skill anyone can learn, at any age, in any career. When someone is confident, they have real influence,” said Dver.

Next month, It Cosmetics will launch a custom Confidence at Work Self-Assessment, powered by research and insights from The American Confidence Institute. The assessment will ask questions about real at-work scenarios and provide a personalized report with confidence coaching commentary and confidence-building tips. The self-assessment will provide a custom analysis, versus a score, and is encouraged to be retaken after implementing practical tips and techniques to monitor confidence levels over time.

Criticisms have recently been made of the so-called confidence culture and whether it is injurious to women by placing the onus of a lack of confidence on individuals rather than larger societal forces at play. Critics argue that rather than loosening the pressure on women, the confidence-inducing and empowering messages increase. That’s because the requirements to look good and young are still present, but with the added pressure to feel confident. It’s a version of feminism that produces a mental discipline of positivity while also minimizing emotions like anger and critique that have propelled activism for women’s advancement. And according to the National Women’s Law Center’s analysis of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ February jobs report, men have recouped all their labor force losses since February 2020, while over 1 million fewer women were in the labor force in January 2022 as compared to February 2020.

Though It Cosmetics seeks to support women in the workforce through its current program, it is not always active in other areas relating to women’s interests or equality. For example, the brand did not post on social media on the topic of abortion access following the leaked majority opinion from the Supreme Court in April, nor did it join the relaunched “Don’t Ban Equality” coalition. Sixty-two other beauty and wellness brands did. Brands like Glow Recipe, Ole Henriksen, The Body Shop and Fenty Beauty joined the coalition or posted on social media following the news. No L’Oréal Group brand joined the coalition.

“There’s [systemic issues], and we acknowledge that. What we are trying to do is really to empower her with tools to help overcome that, so that we aren’t just waiting for society to make the change,” said Comings. “How can she empower herself day-to-day and impact her confidence? Confidence is fought day-to-day with our inner critic.”

Thus far, It Cosmetics has posted the announcements and snippets of advice to its main social channels and will continue to announce new video posts when they are published. It will also integrate confidence advice and announcements in its email marketing, said Comings. To measure the program’s impact, the team will look at how many people took and retook the confidence assessment tool, viewed and shared videos, and read and shared blog posts. After the first year, the program will expand to all international markets for It Cosmetics.",,[],[]
This Benefit Cosmetics Fan Favorite Is Back and Better Than Ever,"Benefit Cosmetics is the leader behind some of the beauty industry's most iconic makeup products. There's the Porefessional Pore Minimizing Primer ($32), the They're Real! Lengthening Mascara ($27), the Watt's Up! Champagne Cream Highlighter ($30), and of course, its Box o' Powder Blush — a product remembered for its buildable pigment and cute packaging. I mean, who can forget about those adorable little boxes that never failed to stand out in one's makeup bag? But as the popular saying goes, out with the old, in with the new, for the brand's popular blush has gotten a complete makeover.

And with blush being one of summer's most reached-for products (hello, instant mood lifter), Benefit's new Wanderful World Blush collection comes at the perfect time to make an impact. The new assortment includes 12 stunning shades to flatter all skin tones and ranges between pinks, berries, bronzes, and oranges. If you were once a fan of the previous formula, the new one is likely to make you a devotee thanks to a renewed silky-soft buttery texture and light-reflecting glow.

The weightless blush ($29) is also sweat-proof, humidity-proof, and smudge-proof — all the more reason to make it a summer makeup staple. The colors are buildable and ultra blendable, with some of our favorite shades including Terra, a golden brick red, Crystah, a strawberry pink, and Butterfly, a golden orange. Each hue helps to create a gorgeous natural-looking flush that can look soft for daytime or become a bit more exaggerated for a nighttime function.

Aside from blendable texture and long wear, highlights include the use of freshwater pearl and synthetic sapphire to give a luminous (not sparkly) glow in addition to a soft-focus, airbrushed finish.

Another element to note is the new and refreshed look of the flatter, wider box, which discards the square brush and plastic cover that once came with each blush box. The revamped product now pairs perfectly with the Multitasking Retractable Cheek Blush ($32). This tapered, dome-shaped tool is made with soft, synthetic bristles that help to create an airbrushed effect and blend powders seamlessly.

Ulta Beauty Q1 Earnings: The Queen Of Cosmetics (NASDAQ:ULTA),"Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment

In my first article covering Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), I implemented a hold recommendation on it and stated investors should wait for a pullback prior to buying the stock. Since my recommendation on April 8th, Ulta did pull back down to the $345-350 range before rebounding following some phenomenal Q1 earnings results.

Data by YCharts

Last week, Ulta gained 22.8%, and as exhibited by the chart above, skyrocketed after beating earnings and more importantly, raising guidance.

Guidance Change (Ulta Q1 Press Release)

While I was on vacation for most of last week, I wasn't able to address the SA community regarding Ulta's pullback and buying opportunity as the stock reached the $340-$350 mark prior to earnings.

Thesis Recap

To recap the thesis from my initial article, there were three key points that drove me to initially purchase ULTA stock.

Strong and loyal customer base Growing Store Count & SSS Stellar Financials & Buybacks

Strong & Resilient Business Model

Ulta's earnings proved that the cosmetics business is very strong. Ulta posted EPS of $6.30 (beat by $1.82) and revenue of $2.34B (beat by $220M), indicating strong growth in a challenging environment for many retailers. We can see through the 1-month stock price charts below comparing Ulta to both direct and indirect competitors, that the beauty retailer has been the best performer.

Data by YCharts

According to the company's 10-Q:

Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, continued pressure from inflation could have an adverse impact on consumer spending and sales.

The above quote exhibits Ulta's dominance and leadership within the cosmetics space. Furthermore, it shows that despite retail challenges, they have truly cultivated a loyal customer base, a key thesis point in my previous article that led me to buy my first share of Ulta early in 2021.

Continue to Rely on Data & Take Advantage of Trends

Through the addition of new brands and expansion of existing ones, Ulta continues to expand its product depth, driving increases in comparable sales. CEO Dave Kimbell mentioned this in the company's Q1 earnings call.

From a trend standpoint, foundation, concealers, eyeliners, and lipstick continue to deliver strong comp growth. New brands like Fenty Beauty, REM Beauty by Ariana Grande, and Treslúce, a mass cosmetics brand founded by Latin Musician, Becky G, contributed to growth during the quarter. While new product launches from a wide range of brands, including Clinique, Lancome, NARS, e.l.f. and NYX also delivered strong sales growth. In addition, this quarter, we expanded MAC into 233 additional stores and introduced CHANEL Beauty into 104 stores.

Ulta Beauty's ability to sport the best brands on its shelves is a key source of its competitive advantage. As the top dog in the beauty space, brands are somewhat reliant on Ulta's retail distribution to gain exposure to their products. The ability to sell high-profile brand names such as Ariana Grande, Becky G, and Kylie Jenner drive customer traffic and build a loyal customer base.

Author Created (SA Earnings Transcripts)

As demonstrated in the chart above, Ulta continues to drive customer loyalty through its rewards program, with north of 37 million ""Ultamate Rewards"" members.

Target Partnership Going Well

In my previous article, Ulta's partnership with Target (TGT) was a key catalyst that had the potential to further Ulta's revenue. As America's 8th largest retailer generating over $100B in annual revenue, Target generates millions in foot traffic which will benefit Ulta.

In Ulta's F'21 10-K, it mentioned that over the long-term, there was potential to have about 800 Ulta in Target locations. In the quarterly call, COO Kecia Steelman commented.

As of today, we've got 140 stores that are open as of today. We're on track to open 250 plus stores with them this year, but we like what we see. When we get a member engaged in our Ultimate Rewards Program, what we're seeing is that they're behaving very similar to our existing loyalty members. As far as brands go, Ulta Beauty works closely with the partners, with our brand partners on the assortment, etcetera, but Target really owns the sales. So, we're not at liberty to comment on the sales-specific performance by brand at this time.

While Ulta cannot comment on the sales-specific performance of the partnership, it had only 100 stores opened at the end of F'21 and plans to open 250 by year-end (30% of its long-term target). While it would be nice to gauge some quantitative performance metrics, I believe it is safe to say that the partnership is beneficial to Ulta.

Why Ulta May Be Able To Resist Inflation

The hottest topic affecting the markets post-COVID has been inflation and its impact on corporate America. However, Ulta mentioned inflation shouldn't have an adverse impact on its business. In order for a business to thrive during an inflationary period, it must have pricing power in order to pass the cost onto the consumer to maintain its margins.

When asked in Q1 earnings, Kimball said that units per transaction are actually flat on a YoY basis, indicative of customers willingness to spend more per transaction.

the units per transaction were essentially flat year-over-year. So, again, we're seeing a lot of the benefit from the continuation what I'd call a moderate promotional environment overall, coupled with the mix of brands we have that entered the assortment here over the course of the last year.

Promotional events such as the 21 Days of Beauty combined with the launch of new brands clearly keep Ulta customers coming back to stores to buy more. When asked by analyst Korinne Wolfmeyer about any noticeable shift between mass vs. prestige brands in light of inflation, Kimball said there have been no meaningful shifts in demand between the two segments.

So far, our guests are managing through it and we're not seeing huge impacts. In fact, as I mentioned in the script, prestige makeup performed a bit higher than mass makeup.... ...one of the unique things that we feel is core to our model is the breadth of our assortment, all price points, from mass to prestige, all categories, hair care and skin care, makeup and bath and fragrance. And so being able to adjust and adapt as consumers' needs evolve has been true to our model for a long time and allowed us to manage through any disruption in the marketplace. But right now, we're seeing strength across all aspects of our business

Further, while many may think cosmetics aren't a necessity despite strong sales, data shows that skincare and haircare routines are still in effect. In Q1, skincare delivered strong double-digit sales comp, similar to last year's first quarter.

Even as they increase makeup usage, beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skincare routines. As a result, skin care delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales comp on top of robust double-digit growth in the first quarter last year. Moisturizers, eye serums, and acne treatments continue to drive category growth in the quarter. We also saw strong growth in sun protection and self-tanning that consumers increased travel and social activities.

Gross & Operating Margins (Tikr)

The chart above demonstrates ULTA's ability to consistently increase its operating margin (green line in the chart) and maintain its strong 40% gross margin (blue line) in the first quarter of 2022.

Commitment to Repurchases

As the Oracle of Omaha Warren buffet emphasizes:

The companies in which we have our largest investments have all engaged in significant stock repurchases at times when wide discrepancies existed between price and value.

As depicted in the second picture of this article above, Ulta has committed $900 million to share repurchases for F'22. In the first quarter, Ulta repurchased 332,000 shares at a cost of $132.8 million, with an average cost per share of $400. While $132.8 million isn't a significant repurchase, it proves that Ulta's management believes in the stock and is focusing on reducing the outstanding share count to drive shareholder returns.

Author Created (Ulta 10-K (2012-2021))

The chart above further exemplifies Ulta's strong history of allocating excess capital, consistently reducing the diluted share count since 2014. The chart below shows Ulta's 10-year EPS, which will continue to be supercharged via buybacks.

EPS Trend (Ulta 10-K's)

The high end of Ulta's EPS guidance ($20.10) implies a strong 12% YoY increase for F'22.

Valuation

Despite Ulta's rise in price, it still trades at a very reasonable 20x earnings. While this is higher than other retailers, Ulta's industry leadership and higher than average margins justify its higher multiple relative to the peer group.

Data by YCharts

As portrayed by the chart above, Ulta's P/E ratio trades at around 20x, well below its 5-year average. While Ulta is not cheap by any means, it truly is a wonderful business at a fair price. While the current macro environment may still cause short-term headwinds, Ulta still has strong fundamentals, a high-quality business model, and a reasonable earnings multiple.

Solid Business

Overall, the first quarter proved that Ulta is in fact the queen of cosmetics and beauty as a whole. With record-breaking numbers, onboarding new brands, and continuing its commitment to repurchase shares, I will upgrade my recommendation on Ulta to a buy. Yes, I know... at $401 last month, I stated it was a ""Hold"" and investors should wait for a pullback. The pullback did in fact occur, but Ulta rebounded immediately, now sitting just north of $400 as of this writing.

Ultimately, Ulta is a wonderful business with extremely loyal customers sporting top brands in both the mass and prestige categories. With its best-in-class loyalty program and ability to adapt to customer preferences, Ulta is an exceptional addition to one's portfolio.",,[],[]
Shoppers Say This Anti-Aging Cream Is Just as Good as La Mer & It’s 40% Off Right Now,"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.

Memorial Day weekend may be over, but the holiday sales are still booming. If you spent your downtime soaking up the sun and hanging with friends instead of sifting through the countless deals, don’t fret—Sephora still has plenty of top-notch products on discount, including the customer-loved It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream. The hydrating moisturizer is a whopping 40 percent off, and considering shoppers compare its quality to that of La Mer’s luxury cream, you don’t want to miss this.

The anti-aging formula was developed with insight from plastic surgeons and dermatologists, according to the brand, and delivers numerous skincare benefits with every application, such as softening fine lines and wrinkles, boosting elasticity, brightening dull skin and shrinking large pores. It also works overtime by promising to deliver 24 hours (!!!) of hydration to the skin.

It contains four key ingredients that make this restorative appearance possible. Ceramides—a.k.a. naturally occurring lipids that make up our skin barrier— work to retain hydration in the skin, while the addition of peptides, amino acids responsible for building up the complexion’s collagen, drastically reduce age lines. Speaking of collagen, you’ll also find it listed as a main ingredient since it leaves smooth, supple skin in its wake. Last but not least, squalane minimizes inflammation and redness across stressed-out areas.

If there’s one thing we love, it’s formulas that actually live up to their claims. Therefore, it’s worth mentioning that the brand put the cream through a clinical-run instrumental study to ensure its efficacy—and the results were highly positive.

That’s not all—the age-defying formula has earned hundreds of five-star reviews from Sephora shoppers who refer to it as a “holy-grail,” “seriously impressive” and “the best face cream ever.” Not to mention, it astonished even more users for its ability to work just as well, if not better, than more expensive options on the market.

“It reminds me of La Mer’s formula and is awesome for dry, chapped skin,” raved one reviewer. “I use tretinoin for my acne and anti-aging which has made my already dry skin very dry. This product and La Mer are some of the best ones I have seen for dry skin that peels, itches, and gets chapped…I’d highly recommend this if you have extremely dry sensitive skin.”

“I’m hooked. My blotchy, cranky skin loves it,” wrote a second shopper. “Honestly, I’m getting as good of results as I do from La Mer (and that stuff, amazing as it is, is SOOOOOO expensive). This is a fraction of the cost, smells clean and my sensitive, uneven skin is looking bright, even and healthy.”

Sugar Cosmetics Closes $50 Million in Series D Round,"PARIS — India’s Sugar Cosmetics, among the country’s biggest omnichannel beauty companies, has closed a $50 million round of Series D funding, led by L Catterton’s Asia fund.

The round also drew ongoing participation from existing investors, A91 Partners, Elevation Capital and India Quotient.

The capital increase will allow Sugar to focus on its digital-first strategy in India’s rapidly developing beauty sector. The country’s beauty and personal care market is expected to reach about $21 billion in 2025, as more consumers use cosmetics and skin care daily, and online shopping is being adopted more in secondary cities.

Sugar has more than quadrupled its sales over the past three years, according to L Catterton, which in a statement attributed that to the brand’s high-quality products and “new-age, impact-focused content marketing.”

“Through a combination of fast-paced e-commerce expansion, accelerated partnerships with general and modern trade stores, as well as diligent same-store sales growth, Sugar has also established a strong omnichannel presence across India,” said L Catterton. “The company’s ability to simultaneously take advantage of the proliferation of online shopping while creating a robust local ecosystem of offline distribution partners has enabled it to attract and retain shoppers across the entire spectrum, from metros to tier two and three cities.”

“We have been impressed with how Sugar has sustained its momentum of rapid growth across online and offline channels, while maintaining healthy operating metrics,” said Anjana Sasidharan, L Catterton Asia managing director, who will join Sugar’s board of directors.

“With a product-first mind-set and deep understanding of their target consumers, Sugar’s leadership team has established a strong position in India’s cosmetics market, which is at an exciting inflection point of expansion,” she continued. “We look forward to partnering with the company to thoughtfully unlock international exposure and further drive growth, leveraging our experience of working with over 20 beauty and personal care companies in L Catterton’s portfolio across the Americas Europe and Asia.”

In the beauty and personal care space, L Catterton has already invested in the likes of Il Makiage, Intercos, The Honest Company and Elemis.

According to the abstract, the authors analyzed the skin-protecting efficacy of the product against the effects of blue light irradiation both in vivo and through the in situ quantitative and qualitative evaluation of protein carbonylation in human skin explants.

Skin explants treated with the test product showed significantly lower levels of accumulated carbonylated proteins, translating to an 82% reduction following exposure to blue light at 460 nm. In vivo studies also indicated the TDF Blu Voile Sunscreen provided significant efficacy against immediate and persistent pigmentation induced by blue light at 415 nm.

The authors concluded that TDF Blu Voile Sunscreen can protect against oxidative stress as well as the immediate and persistent pigmentation induced by blue light.

Lucrative growth in Southeast Asian Countries

The increased awareness about animal welfare and the harmful impacts of synthetic cosmetics across the southeast Asian countries are driving the demand for halal cosmetics. Further, countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia have a majority of the Muslim population which is driving the demand for halal cosmetics in such countries. Moreover, the implementation of halal product law in Indonesia has positively impacted the market. The halal product law was implemented in 2019, and it applies to cosmetics, foods, and non-food products & services. Under this set of regulations, all foreign beauty products distributed or retailed in Indonesia will be treated as non-halal cosmetic products until the products are halal certified in Indonesia or by an accredited foreign certification body. Also, the presence of established halal cosmetic brands such as Wardah has led to the increased demand for halal cosmetics in Southeast Asian countries.

Halal Cosmetics Market Size: Segment Overview

Based on product type, the market is segmented into skincare, haircare, makeup, and others. In 2021, the skincare segment held the largest halal cosmetics market share. The skincare product category includes cosmetic products such as moisturizers, hydrating and anti-aging creams, toners, serums, and lotions. The growing demand for health-promoting and self-care products worldwide has led to the growth of the skincare segment.

Based on category, the halal cosmetics market is segmented into men, women, and unisex. The women segment is expected to grow rapidly during the forecast period. The growing number of working women and the growing number of beauty clinics are aiding the halal cosmetics market.

Based on distribution channel, the market is segmented into supermarkets and hypermarkets, specialty stores, online retail, and others. The online retail segment is expected to grow rapidly during the forecast period.

Halal cosmetics are products that do not include any ingredient derived from animals. These products are progressively gaining traction worldwide, especially since customers across all industries indicate a preference for cruelty-free cosmetic products. They are made using a complex combination of ingredients in accordance with halal guidelines. Manufacturers continuously check the products to ensure that they meet the halal grade. In comparison to standard cosmetics products on the market, the safety and quality of halal cosmetic principles are difficult to assess.

This reason also adds to the increased global popularity of halal-certified cosmetics. As a result, the halal cosmetics business is expected to rise in the future. Moreover, the younger generation is more concerned about adopting environment friendly practices. Halal is the most recent addition to the sustainability category. Consumer understanding of ingredients used in cosmetics has risen dramatically in recent years. Consumers' changing behavior patterns, which have made them more concerned about animal welfare, have resulted in a shift toward more sustainable and environment friendly alternatives.

Based on distribution channel, the halal cosmetics market is segmented into supermarkets and hypermarkets, specialty stores, online retail, and others. In 2021, the specialty stores segment was the dominant segment in the market.

Thus, increased focus on customer satisfaction has led to a surge in demand for purchasing halal cosmetics from specialty stores. Online retail is expected to be the fastest-growing segment in the halal cosmetics market. Online retail is one of the fastest-growing distribution channels owing to its convenience in terms of shopping and product delivery. Online retail stores offer a wider range of products and heavy discounts; also, consumers can conveniently buy desirable products remotely.

The halal cosmetics market, based on geography, is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific (APAC), South & Central America, and the Middle East & Africa (MEA).

"'Oil-free' Cosmetics Suit vs. Target Dismissed, Mostly","""Nowhere on the oil-free product packaging does defendant inform consumers that the oil-free products contain oil,"" the complaint stated.

A proposed class action suit filed in July 2021 against Target claims the retailer misled consumers over claims of ""oil-free"" cosmetics. The suit was recently dismissed by an Illinois federal judge for 12 of the 13 products cited, Law360 reports. Further action for the 13th product was not disclosed.

According to the case summary, plaintiff Adam Sorkin alleged that Target's advertising and marketing of its Up & Up brand cosmetics as ""oil-free"" is false and misleading as they contain at least one oil. More specifically, per Law360, Sorkin claimed the facial moisturizer he bought contained two oils: Glycine soja sterols and dimethicone. The judge found the plaintiff did not purchase most of the products listed in the complaint.

""Consumers reasonably expect that the oil-free products will, in fact, be 'oil-free,'"" Sorkin's complaint stated. ""Nowhere on the oil-free product packaging does defendant inform consumers that the oil-free products contain oil. Consumers, like plaintiff, would not have been able to understand that the oil-free products contained oil absent an advanced understanding of chemistry. Defendant’s misrepresentations and/or omissions violate consumers’ reasonable expectations and, as alleged herein, Illinois’s consumer protection statutes.”

Further, Sorkin alleged the defendant ""employs professional chemists to create the chemical formulas for the oil-free products. Therefore, defendant through its employees knew or should have known that the oil-free products contained oils and that by labeling the products as 'oil-free,' it was deceiving consumers.""

Premium Cosmetics Market 2022-2026: Segmentation

Geography

37% of the market's growth will originate from APAC during the forecast period. China and Japan are the key markets for premium cosmetics in APAC. Market growth in this region will be faster than the growth of the market in other regions.

Product

The premium cosmetics market share growth by the skincare products segment will be significant during the forecast period. The skincare market is growing as both young and old women seek products to help them achieve better-looking skin.

Premium Cosmetics Market 2022-2026: Driver

One of the key factors driving growth in the premium cosmetics market is the increased demand for premium skincare products. Selected professional skincare product manufacturers provide innovative, professional treatments to their customers, followed by giving them premium products that are costlier than regular skincare products. Consumers are more aware of skincare concerns like aging spots, acne, and pigmentation and hence, are ready to pay for premium skincare products. Innovative skincare products have the right combination of superior-quality ingredients, a factor that leads to product premiumization. With rising disposable income, consumers do not mind spending more on premium products, which has led to increased demand for premium cosmetics, especially skincare products. Also, skincare brands focus on differentiating themselves from pharmaceutical companies. Therefore, they invest in innovative ingredients and technologies that would positively affect the health and appearance of customers' skin.

Premium Cosmetics Market 2022-2026: Challenge

The lack of consumer reach and premium brand penetration in major parts of developing regions, including MEA and APAC will be a major challenge for the premium cosmetics market during the forecast period. Building an effective distribution network and strategizing product distribution have always been major concerns for beauty products manufacturers. Strategic distribution involves selecting distribution channel partners, which becomes more difficult in the case of premium beauty products, such as face oils, as they are mainly available in specialty beauty retail stores and department stores and sometimes through e-retailers. The penetration of department stores and specialty beauty retail stores is the highest in developed nations and tier-1 cities. However, there are very few consumers who buy premium cosmetics in tier-2 and tier-3 cities of developing nations of MEA and APAC, which makes it unfeasible for retailers or vendors to open stores in these cities. Also, logistics forms a major concern as most retailers, whether brick and mortar or e-retailers, lack in building strong delivery channels in these cities. The lack of reach to consumers and low premium brand penetration in major parts of developing regions, including MEA and APAC, challenge the growth of the global premium cosmetics market.

Color Cosmetics Introduction

Color additives have been used for a very long time as a way of embellishing the aesthetic value of foods, beverages, as well as cosmetics and also for determining drugs and other products. The products which are naturally obtained such as paprika, turmeric, saffron and other inorganic mineral pigments have been utilized for millions of years. Similarly, color cosmetics can be understood as personal care products that assist in enhancing the appearance of the human body.

Color cosmetics infer to the cosmetic colorants and ingredients used for skincare, hair care, make-up, personal hygiene, oral care and fragrance. Color cosmetics include personal care products like eye shadows, foundations, powders, nail paints, concealers, lipsticks, bronzers and others.

Color Cosmetics Market Dynamics

In the present day and age, consumers have become more and more conscious about their personal appearance, especially the young generation, owing to the rising trend of social media platforms, which plays a primary role in boosting the growth of the global color cosmetics market.

In addition to that, people who are in their midlife or elderly are also equally concerned about their skin and hair and the overall appearance and thus, stimulate the demand of products like skin care creams, serums and lotions, which further positively fuel the demand of color cosmetics in the global markets. Owing to this, the global color cosmetics market is projected to grow substantially over the forecast period.

Moreover, with time the cosmetic products have also been through numerous innovations and constantly modified and advanced which is also an accelerating factor for the growth of the global color cosmetic market in the years to come.

Other than that, color cosmetics contain certain benefits such as the compounds present in most of the color cosmetics are also likely to bestow some considerable skincare beneficial impacts. On top of that, the color cosmetics also carry the potential to conceal certain blemishes, make certain features distinguishable, improve the entire physical appearance, and make an individual appear healthy and refreshed. Attributing to this, color cosmetics is expected to witness extensive demand in the near future, thereby propelling the growth of the global color cosmetic market.

However, the heavy cost of color cosmetics may not be affordable for everyone which may act as a restraining factor for the growth in the demand of color cosmetics across the world. Along with that, the strict government regulations regarding purity and safety of color cosmetics is another major factor that is likely to hold back the growth of the global color cosmetics market to the bounds.

Marvel’s Midnight Suns DLC will include new superheroes and cosmetics,"Marvel’s Midnight Suns’ character roster is basically complete now that Spider-Man and Scarlet Witch have been confirmed, but if you’re worried your favourite superhero hasn’t made the cut don’t worry – it’s possible they’ll make it into Firaxis’ upcoming Marvel strategy game as DLC.

“There are more characters coming post release,” confirms senior franchise producer Garth DeAngelis. “We have four heroes in the works… they’re gonna have their own story missions, they’re gonna have the full gameplay suite. So all new abilities that you’ll be able to bring into your decks as well as developing friendships with them and relationships and things like that.”

These characters will likely come as part of the season pass announced today during Summer Game Fest. DeAngelis stopped short of confirming the identities of the new heroes, but Midnight Suns already contains characters from several areas of Marvel fandom – The Avengers, X-Men, New Mutants, and heroes like Blade and Ghost Rider. DeAngelis also says that Marvel has been really easy to work with, and the implication is Firaxis has free reign to introduce any characters it feels it has the resources to do so.

“[Marvel has] been so cool to work with,” DeAngelis explains. “I’m not kidding, they were just like, ‘what do you guys want to do?’ And we told them, and they’re like, ‘Okay, here’s some information’.”

In addition to the four new characters, we also know there will be an in-game marketplace area for “premium” cosmetics. DeAngelis confirms that Firaxis has no plans on selling card packs through the marketplace, but it will sell additional cosmetics, such as iconic costumes from the wider Marvel multiverse.

“[There are] a lot of throwbacks to different comic runs, and new, unique, outfits that we’ve created with Marvel. You can equip them not just in combat, but you can have them in the Abbey.”

Depending on which edition of Midnight Suns you purchase, you may get some of these right out of the gate. The Legendary Edition, for example, includes a whopping 23 cosmetic skins, as well as the season pass itself.

The Marvel’s Midnight Suns release date is October 7, 2022, on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. It is available to pre-order now.

Kylie Jenner & Stormi Webster Shopped Kylie Cosmetics At Ulta Beauty,"Could you imagine just casually running into Kylie Jenner and her daughter Stormi Webster at Ulta Beauty? Well, that’s exactly what happened to a few lucky fans on Wednesday, June 8, when the mother-daughter duo went out for a surprise shopping trip in Calabasas. Luckily, Kylie documented the whole thing on social media.

“It's a very special day today because I am taking my daughter to see my makeup at Ulta,” Kylie said in a June 8 TikTok, before asking Stormi whether she was “excited” to go shopping. “Yeah,” the four-year-old responded while smiling sweetly at the camera. The video showed the two driving up to Ulta Beauty and walking hand-in-hand toward the store. “We’re here! I’m so happy!” Kylie said.

Kylie first launched her collections at Ulta in 2018, and this is far from the first time she’s shopped her own collection at the store; however, this trip was particularly special because Stormi accompanied her.

Once inside the store, the duo of course visited the Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin section to browse through all of the products. Kylie put their shopping cart on the floor and let Stormi pick out whatever she wanted. Her first choice turned out to be a red Kylie Lip Kit. Meanwhile, Kylie chose the Matte Lip Kit. The two also grabbed some blush and the last mauve pallet in the store before heading to the register.

Kylie also stopped to take some selfies with fans. After finishing checking out, she and Stormi went back to their car where Kylie tested out the Matte Lip Kit. “This shade is so pretty,” she said.

On Instagram, Kylie also posted two photos inside Ulta Beauty with Stormi. The 24-year-old star wore a yellow V-neck top with white jeans and pink heels for the trip, while her daughter wore a floral dress, white sneakers, and a mini pink Prada purse.

“Took my angel baby gorgeous goosey girl to see @kylieskin & @kyliecosmetics at @ultabeauty 💗,” Kylie said in the caption. “Still such a dream every time I visit. thank you to the entire ulta team always xx.”

Kylie and Stormi looked like they had the best time shopping together.",,[],[]

This comprehensive effort includes a global portfolio of water restoration projects, which will provide a range of solutions to protect ecosystems; replenish groundwater supplies; reduce the amount of water diverted from essential bodies of water; and improve water quality for the communities and wildlife that depend on them.

The significance of this effort and P&G’s commitment is highlighted by a goal to restore more water than is consumed by using P&G products in the critically water-stressed metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and Mexico City.

P&G’s strategy aims to help build a water positive future by reducing water use in manufacturing; responding to water challenges through innovation and partnerships; and supporting projects in 18 water-stressed areas. These goals and actions build on the company’s existing Ambition 2030 sustainability efforts across climate, nature, waste and water.

The company will achieve these goals through partnerships with leading environmental organizations and restoration projects that improve, manage and protect water resources.

“Water is one of the world’s most critical natural resources and something too many often take for granted,"" said Jon Moeller, P&G president and chief executive officer. ""For years we have been focused on reducing water use in our operations and innovating to help consumers use less water in the home but there is much more we can all do. Together with our partners, we are expanding our efforts that will improve, manage and protect water resources in stressed areas that will help sustain people and nature for generations to come.”",,[],[]

BASF Offers Range of LowPCF Intermediates for Reduced Carbon,"BASF will now offer five chemical intermediates as low product carbon footprint (LowPCF) after analysis revealed their PCFs were lower than those of corresponding third-party chemicals.

BASF has announced it now offers a range of chemical intermediates as LowPCF (low product carbon footprint). The company calculated the individual PCFs of a portion of its portfolio and reportedly found that those in the LowPCF range are significantly below the global average of corresponding third-party chemicals. Calculations of the latter were based on publicly available information and proprietary market survey data on the production routes and deployed raw materials of the third-party chemicals.

According to BASF, the products' low PCFs are due to its gas-fired combined heat and power plants generating significantly less greenhouse gas emissions, compared with other conventional energy generation, and the high production efficiency of BASF’s Verbund system in terms of energy and raw material consumption. The LowPCF range intermediates generally use oil, natural gas or Verbund by-products as primary raw materials, and not coal.

PCF values comprise the total greenhouse gas emissions that occur until the BASF product leaves the factory gate: from the extraction of resources through the manufacturing of precursors to the making of the final chemical product itself.

BASF’s LowPCF intermediates include:

Tert-Butylamine (tBA) LowPCF

Formic Acid (FA) LowPCF

Propionic Acid (PA) LowPCF

1,6-Hexanediol (HDO) LowPCF

Neopentyl Glycol (NPG) LowPCF

Stephan Kothrade, head of BASF's intermediates division, said, “Company CO2 emission reduction targets are playing an increasingly important role in the value chains we serve. With our LowPCF intermediates, we are supporting our customers in achieving their targets: they now have the option to consciously choose a product with a carbon footprint significantly below the global market average. By making CO2 emission data at the individual product level available to our customers, we also offer a level of transparency that is unique in the chemical industry.”",,[],[]
Skatebird Update Introduces New Cosmetics and Among Us Crossover,"Indie titles are often some of the most creative outlets in the gaming industry. Bringing together and meshing new and unique ideas are quite commonly found through indie game development spaces. These radical new games often spurn into creating their own representation of a classic video game format. For instance, Glass Bottom Games, who released Skatebird last September. Instantly recognizable as a remix of Tony Hawk Pro Skater appeal, the title drew in a large audience of players. Ranging from skating to sandbox, many fans were intrigued by the simulation title. Yet, since release, the title hasn’t received too much post-launch support. For the retail price of $20, the game certainly has quite a lot to keep many fans that like to finish objectives or tune a high score. However, it seems that Glass Bottom Games is returning to the title with a brand new free update launching today. As part of the Wholesome Direct showcasing a slew of upcoming games, the Skatebird 1.7 update launches today with new cosmetics and even an Among Us crewmate cameo.

Why Does The Skatebird 1.7 Update Include An Among Us Crewmate Cameo?

While the release is the first big update since the 1.0 launch just 8 months ago, it’s a great support update into the first year of the launch. A brand new course to skate in is a great addition to the already expansive base release that showcased the scale of space birds are more comfortable with. With that in mind, this new update also brings some secret characters. In the spirit of Tony Hawk Pro Skater that inspired the game. One revealed in the Skatebird trailer is the eponymous Among Us crewmate who slides in with their own cosmetics. Each come customizable, just like the birds with their own added flair racing down the skateparks. While other secret skaters are yet to be seen, there’s sure to be more as Glass Bottom Games continues to make more Skatebird updates.

So what do you think about the Skatebird update adding the Among Us crewmate as a character? Let us know in the comments down below!",,[],[]
Top 2 beauty stocks to benefit from increased consumer spending on cosmetics,"More recent earnings by large retail companies were not all that great, indicating that consumers might have difficulties coping with inflation. However, the most recent developments in consumer spending are considerably greater than was previously believed.

The recent conference on the “Future of the Consumer” hosted by Cowen & Co. shed light on a few important areas where consumer demand is still relatively high. As a result, Oliver Chan, a market analyst, highlighted a number of encouraging tendencies within consumer demographics.

“With customers returning to work and group events, beauty and wellness adjacent categories are seeing an acceleration. Customers are sticking with their skin care routines developed during the pandemic while also looking to refresh their color cosmetics for events.”

Meanwhile, Finbold has researched two companies that could be set to benefit from the strong consumer demand for beauty and cosmetics products.

E.l.f. Beauty Inc. (NYSE: ELF)

ELF is a beauty-centric company focusing primarily on lower-priced cosmetics for the eyes, lips, and face, having a unique selling point of ‘cruelty-free’ products. Over the years, the management has done a solid job of growing earnings, while profits and cash flow have been volatile.

Yet, in the most recent earnings release, the company increased its revenue year-on-year (YoY) by 13.5%, to $105.12 million, which beat expectations by $13.92 million.

Similarly, earnings per share (EPS) were $0.13, which beat expectations by $0.07. Besides, management gave upbeat guidance on 2022 and 2023 earnings expectations.

In essence, year-to-date (YTD) shares are down over 17%, but the shares have surged in more recent sessions on increased trading volumes. Currently, they are trading above the 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), closing in on the 200-day SMA. If shares break above, more upside could be had.

At the same time, analysts on Wall Street deem the shares a strong buy. The average next 12 months’ share price is seen at $32.50, which represents a potential increase of 19% from the current trading price of $27.31.

Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA)

Ulta is the largest beauty retailer in the U.S., with a growing store count and seemingly loyal customer base. On May 27, after the earnings report, the company received a bullish re-rating from Jeffries.

For Q1 earnings, the company posted revenue of $2.34 billion, a YoY increase of 20.6%, beating estimates by $220 million. Also, the company had EPS of $6.30, beating estimates by $1.82. Finally, ULTA offered improved guidance for the rest of the year.

Over the past six months, the shares have gained almost 10%, while more recent sessions have seen increased trading volumes after a double-bottom was noted on the daily chart. A bounce off of the $340 low propelled the shares by over 23%, where they now trade above all SMAs.

Meanwhile, analysts rate the shares a moderate buy, seeing the average price in the next 12 months reaching $467.44, a potential increase of 12.22%, from the current trading price of $416.54.

It seems that consumers are in a solid position to keep buying beauty products after the Covid lockdowns seemingly doomed us to a home-based existence.

Consumer surveys also show that companies with an online presence stand to potentially benefit more from the shifting consumer sentiment and increased spending.

The above two companies have shown steady earnings growth, as evidenced by the latest reports and could possibly offer solid returns for investors looking to play the consumer spending trend.

Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 3 Battle Pass Rewards And All Cosmetics,"A new season of Fortnite has arrived, and for some players, the best part is browsing (and eventually unlocking) the battle pass rewards and cosmetics. Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 3 is themed ""Vibin',"" which means this season's battle pass is full of characters who are slick and stylish, though not all of them abide by a good-vibes-only policy. For example, Darth Vader, this season's level 100 reward, has never been one to sit back and chill.

Thankfully, he won't need to, as this season you can unlock his Imperial March emote, which includes his intimidating walk and accompanying iconic music. Other standout emotes this season include Blowin' Up (""But first let me take a selfie"") on Page 2 of the battle pass, as well as Steady (featuring the song Own Brand Freestyle by FelixThe1st and Dreya Mac) which you can unlock on Page 7 of the battle pass.

Battle Stars are back for the fifth consecutive season, perhaps signaling Epic has finally landed on a unlock system it prefers most of all. That means you'll have some agency in deciding which items you unlock first. As you complete earlier pages, subsequent pages will unlock, often even before finishing your earlier pages, meaning you can sometimes skip ahead to items you're eager to acquire.

The battle pass ends on September 17. At 15 weeks long, this season will go on a whole month longer than Season 2, meaning diligent players unlocking their daily and weekly challenges shouldn't have an issue grabbing all 100+ items shown here. Remember, the battle pass rewards not currently on display will be revealed soon, usually two weeks after launch. This includes the season's Super Level Styles which pile on the rewards up to tier 200. For more on the new season, don't miss the new weapons in Chapter 3 Season 3, map changes, and how to unlock Indiana Jones

Here's everything you can get in the battle pass this season. The only thing not pictured is the 1,000 V-Bucks--we expect you know what those look like. Which new character is your favorite?",,[],['Mark Delaney']
Can controversial cosmetics brand Lime Crime make a comeback?,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Lime Crime’s new chief executive officer has had a lot on her plate, even by C-suite standards. Andrea Blieden, who joined from The Body Shop in 2020, has been tasked with turning around public opinion of an American brand once dubbed beauty’s “most hated” company.

The cosmetics company was founded in 2008 by Doe Deere (her legal name is Xenia Vorotova), supported by her husband, Mark Dumbleton, with a message of vegan-backed self-expression and requests to “unleash your inner unicorn”. While the brand enjoyed cult status for its eccentric and colourful products and was stocked in retailers such as Nasty Gal, Urban Outfitters and, briefly, Sephora, its achievements were overshadowed in the mid-2010s by a string of problematic incidents.

They included a class-action lawsuit over an alleged data breach that led to customer credit card details being exposed (which ended in a settlement) and a widely circulated image of the founder dressed as Adolf Hitler for Halloween. Deere addressed the photo (taken in 2006, before she started the brand) in an Instagram Live in 2018, describing it as “not my finest hour” and clarifying that she “never subscribed” to Nazi beliefs, calling them “the lowest of the low” and noting she is Jewish. Multiple social media accounts and blogs detailed the company’s missteps and images and videos of people destroying their products with the hashtag #BoycottLimeCrime. In 2018, private equity firm Tengram Capital Partners acquired the company, and in 2020, Deere and Dumbleton stepped down from the board.

Blieden is one of many new hires, with only “three or four people” from the previous staff remaining. Michael Trempus, a former L’Oréal and Estée Lauder executive, has joined as senior vice president of sales; while Emma Fahri-Hopkins, who previously worked at L’Occitane and The Perfume Shop, is chief financial officer. “As soon as I began, I had to fill roles,” says Blieden. “I had to attract and bring in the right kind of talent who had done the due diligence on the brand and were ready to commit to this fresh start.”

Reinventing the business

The new chief executive’s priority has been to return the brand to its larger-than-life, bold and inventive routes. Lime Crime is best known for bright, neon and alternative makeup from hair dyes to eyeshadows, eschewing mainstream trends in favour of subversive culture.",,[],"['Condé Nast', 'Daniela Morosini']"

The app has accumulated over 19,000 keytalks and provides real-time information recommendations based on what you’re looking for, ranging from “Moisturizers You Need This Summer” to “Dewy Glow, Plumping Skin Treatments,” said Emma Kim, CEO of Glamai.
