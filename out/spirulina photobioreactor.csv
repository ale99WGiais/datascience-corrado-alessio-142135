Women in aquaculture: Jenny Soria Nina,"Peruvian Jenny Soria Nina develops technologies to facilitate the growth of the aquaculture sector. One of her recent successes is a mobile hatchery designed to produce scallops and other aquatic species.

Can you briefly describe your aquaculture career? I studied aquaculture engineering in Lima, Peru. I started my working career in 2005, researching the reproduction and culture of red sea urchin (Loxechinus albus).

Nina with the photobioreactors produced by her company, Biomarino Nina founded Biomarino, a company dedicated to the development of innovative technological aquaculture equipment for the local and international market, in 2016

After this, I had different jobs; I worked as a hatchery manager for scallop, oyster and spirulina and at the University of Piura on the production of microalgae. In 2016, I co-founded Biomarino, a company dedicated to the development of innovative technological aquaculture equipment for the local and international market. Providing solutions to real production problems, we carry out demonstrative research and apply what we have learned to increase the productivity and profitability of our clients. What drew you to aquaculture in the first place? My older sister studied international trade and always brought home magazines about fisheries and aquaculture, which I started reading. Through these articles, I learned about the possibilities of a career in aquaculture. I liked that in aquaculture there is a large variety of jobs to choose from and specialise in. I also like that a career in aquaculture gives me the opportunity to travel a lot. What species have you been working with? I have been working with several species. The first species I worked with were grey and red tilapia. I have also worked with scallops, oysters, abalone, sea urchin, shrimp, macroalgae and microalgae. What work-related achievement are you most proud of? Last year, I won a silver medal for one of our inventions at the Korea International Women’s Invention Exposition, which was organised by the Korea Women Inventors Association (KWIA). We received the prize for a mobile laboratory for the production of molluscs and other aquaculture species such as fish and shrimp. It is a portable system that is easy to install and runs on 95 percent solar energy.



Mobile laboratory for the production of molluscs and other aquaculture species Biomarino is building mobile aquaculture laboratories with high production capacities that can be deployed anywhere that has a good supply of water

It consists of two metal containers, one with the necessary equipment for spawning and assisted reproduction, including photobioreactors which allow the accelerated production of microalgae. It also houses the solar power system and electric back-up generators to use on days with little sunlight or higher energy consumption, and a water storage tank. The second container houses the culture tanks. When using seawater, the system disinfects the intake water and treats the effluent water before water is returned to the sea. The system has been tested for the production of scallops in the bay of Sechura, Peru. We are currently building a second unit with a higher production volume in the same area. However, the mobile laboratory can be used anywhere as long as there is a good supply of water.

What does a typical day in your current role consist of? In a typical day, I move between the office, the workshop and the hatchery. I work on administration and reporting, supervise the quality control of production of the system components, and supervise the entire process of culturing scallops and microalgae.

My favourite part is to follow the farming process of scallops. When, in the metamorphosis stage, a large amount of larva adheres to the substrate, which is proof of a job well done, I feel very satisfied. Jenny Soria Nina

What is your favourite part of working in aquaculture? My favourite part is to follow the farming process of scallops. When, in the metamorphosis stage, a large amount of larva adheres to the substrate, which is proof of a job well done, I feel very satisfied. What challenges have you encountered working in the sector? During my first job, I was part of a team to create a 100 percent handmade scallop hatchery on Chuncho Island in Peru – without electricity, fresh water, microscopes or air blowers. The team was very committed and we managed to produce scallop seed up to 2-3 millimetres for stocking in the sea. We replaced water using a motorised pump and used natural light to culture microalgae in fibreglass tanks. We stirred the water manually to add oxygen and counted larvae with our naked eyes. The hatchery went on to operate for two years. Have you encountered (or heard of) any gender-related challenges in the sector? In almost all my jobs that I have had, 90 percent of the professionals were men. I am always the only woman at work. Women are given less heavy – but often meticulous and critical – work. It is good that there are women who can carry out this work. But, on the other hand, professionals should know all aspects of their work and therefore women should be involved in all tasks, if they want to be.



The [aquaculture] sector is very broad and you can specialise in culturing crops, studying diseases, environmental issues, research, innovation and much more. Jenny Soria Nina

Are there any individuals or organisations in aquaculture that you’ve found particularly inspirational? The two people that I look up to are Kiyotaka Kani, a highly skilled Japanese professional specialised in shellfish farming whom I had the chance to work with back in 2005, and Dr Luis Vinatea, who is a highly qualified Peruvian specialised in intensive fish farming in land-based systems. He is a great example for me and I hope to meet him someday. What advice would you give to women who are considering joining the aquaculture sector? I would recommend that they study aquaculture, it is a beautiful career. The sector is very broad and you can specialise in culturing crops, studying diseases, environmental issues, research, innovation and much more. Women tend to be creative, detail-oriented, perfectionist and meticulous. These qualities are very important in aquaculture – especially when working on potential new species for aquaculture or research. It is important that women are represented on every team.

What’s the most unusual experience you’ve had in aquaculture? I think it was when we changed the algae culture medium for a culture medium containing fishmeal. This was a mistake, after three days it smelled terribly and we had to go into the lab to stop the culture and clean everything, a very unpleasant job! If you could solve one issue in aquaculture what would it be? Improving the quality of water used for aquaculture. Only with high water quality can we produce healthy animals in intensive or super-intensive systems. Water management processes must be improved regardless of the species. Over the years, it has been proven that the quality of seawater and rivers is declining. This means that we must keep optimising our water treatment processes, especially if we want to increase stocking densities and volumes. At Biomarino, we have patented an industrial processor for the sterilisation of seawater, with high efficiency and low energy consumption. Water is sterilised using a magnetic induction system and rapidly cooled by thermos-electric plates.

Heated tanks in the mobile production system Nina hopes that she can help the sector adopt and transition to digital technologies over the next ten years

What species that you’ve worked with do you think is the most promising for aquaculture? I believe that to ensure food security in the world, tilapia is the most important species since it adapts very well to different environmental conditions, is very strong, grows fast and has good yields. Because farming tilapia is easy and less demanding compared to other species, it can be adopted by many people. Another promising group of species is microalgae. These can be cultured in super-intensive photobioreactors. Microalgae products is used as food, food additives, pharmaceuticals, and in the future, they could replace fishmeal and soybean meal. What would you like to be doing in 10 years’ time? I would like to be changing the entire process of traditional aquaculture to automated and digitised production systems to increase the sustainability of the products, reduce labour efforts and lower production costs.",,[],['Kyra Hoevenaars']
Could Spirulina be the next super-nutraceutical to be widely grown in indoor vertical farms?,"Image above: Algae production using a geothermal energy source. Image credit: Algaennovation, Iceland.

Who fancies some blue food? Really?

The theory of food colour confusion may originate from us being strongly aroused by foods on the red spectrum. Research published in Nature recently showed that we are more attracted to red coloured foods as they appear to signal better nutrition with higher calories in comparison to blue or green foods. Trichromatic vision evolved in humans as a response to improve foraging and may explain why we rely more on sight than scent when locating the most nutritious foods and fruits that are ripe and ready to eat. This is surprising to us as ‘leafy green’ farmers when we readily assume a green colour relates to health but the Nature study was more assigned to calorific colour arousal. Although our brains may not easily accept the blue colour as natural, our bodies will probably thank us if we do as blue-green algae also known as cyanobacteria has some of the best health benefits. Superfoods: Yogurt with blue Spirulina, Scottish Damsens, Blueberries and Sloes.

One particular cyanobacteria has been studied extensively over the years

Spirulina grows naturally in alkaline waters and was recognised and farmed by ancient civilisations for its medicinal qualities. The Aztecs of Mexico have a long historical relationship with Spirulina. They farmed Spirulina in large lakes, then harvested and air dried the algae to form a hard edible ‘cake’. This was often mixed with other foods and used as an energy source as these ancient people recognised it as an important functional food.

Massive health benefits that many people have still to discover

People who move beyond the colour tend to use blue-green algae for supercharging the immune system, controlling muscle spasms, detoxing heavy metals, eliminating candida, improving memory and increasing energy levels to improve exercise performance. It may also lower cholesterol and blood sugar, acting to prevent heart disease, heal wounds and improve digestion. Pretty impressive qualities for this single celled life form billions of years old.

There are two main species of the blue green algae Spirulina, Arthrospira platensis and Arthrospira maxima. As the image demonstrates, they are made up of single cells containing chlorophyll filled vesicles that react to light and photosynthesize like plants. Cultivation of commercial algae usually starts the life cycle in lab culture tubes, doubling quickly under controlled conditions. This helps to eliminate contaminants. Spirulina is the largest single celled blue green algae and it forms spirals visible to the human eye which bunch together to allow a quick harvest and is now cultivated worldwide as a nutritional supplement.

Spirulina is high in iron, calcium, magnesium, copper, beta-carotene and B-vitamins.

Apart from the high content of protein, Spirulina contains B vitamins, particularly B12 and provitamin A (β-carotenes), and minerals, especially iron. It is also rich in phenolic acids, tocopherols and γ-linolenic acid. Spirulina does not have a cellulose cell wall so it is more easily digested. Most people selling dried Spirulina suggest 1-8g per day to boost the immune system but be careful as too much can have negative effects so it’s best to start with the lowest dose.

Some suggest Spirulina has the power to tackle world wide problems like malnutrition. The UN and WHO recommend Spirulina for it’s extremely high nutritional value and sustainability. It has even been called the ‘world’s most sustainable food’ with the potential to end world hunger. The Pole Pole Foundation in the Congo were finalists in the Earthshot Prize recently. They are leading the way to teach communities in developing countries how to grow Spirulina as a supplement to prevent childhood malnutrition.

Could Spirulina be an alternative vegan protein source?

Would you drink blue milk? Many vegans are looking for alternative sources of protein. Spirulina might even be a protein source of the future and a substitute for cow’s milk. Spirulina platensis stands out for being one of the richest protein sources of microbial origin having similar protein levels when compared to meat and soybeans. Not to be confused with regular green Spirulina in its basic form, blue Spirulina is an extract of the active ingredient phycocyanin in its purest form. This concentrates the dried extract with higher levels of antioxidants without so much of the fishy taste of fresh Spirulina. But if you don’t mind using fresh Spirulina (it’s fishy so it’s much better to mix with stronger flavours) it will provide protein that is quickly and easily absorbed in the body compared to animal proteins which is a bonus as it contains many essential amino acids that the body cannot synthesize alone and are essential for tissue renewal.

Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory

Fresh Spirulina is high in antioxidants, especially phycocyanin, the pigment which causes the blue green colour. Phycocyanin can promote blood cell regeneration, improve lymphocyte activity and improve the lymphatic system. Studies have shown this antioxidant scavenges and fights the free radicals that cause oxidative damage.

Spirulina is known to be alkalizing to the body which boosts beneficial microflora in the gut. Liver function is improved and this greatly increases detoxification levels in the body. Fresh Spirulina contains chlorophyll and phycocyanin both of which help to remove toxins such as heavy metals and other pollutants from the blood. One remarkable study in children who lived close to Chernobyl after the nuclear disaster in 1986 found that giving them a small 5g dose of Spirulina a day could reduce radionuclide rates by half in less than two months.

Spirulina has Cancer fighting benefits

Spirulina has been hailed as an anticancer superfood, but reading further into peer reviewed literature is important as there are some extrapolated and conflicting reports from doing a simple google search. So here we only present peer reviewed data. From our research low dose Spirulina has anti-proliferation effects on stomach cancer cells, human leukaemia cells and B lymphoma cells, inhibiting carcinogenesis.

Eating Spirulina daily may lead to increased energy levels

Fresh Spirulina is particularly good for energy owing to its high nutrient density. Since the algae has no cell wall to break down, digestion of all those nutrients is fast and efficient. It can make a difference to energy levels quickly after consumption. Fresh Spirulina contains constituents such as polysaccharides (Rhamnose and Glycogen) and essential fats that are absorbed easily by cells and theoretically aid energy release. More studies are needed to be truly conclusive though but with low toxicity levels in the body, it’s well worth your own trials.

Spirulina enhances energy performance because it unlocks sugar from our cells. If you are suffering from memory loss, this bacteria added daily to your routine appears to have significant effects. It does this by protecting the brain from free-radical damage by increasing the activity of two enzymes: catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which fight free radicals and make the brain more resistant to aging.

But It’s not all good news

Spirulina may exacerbate autoimmune reactions in some people who are susceptible. As such it may worsen symptoms of multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions linked to overactive immune systems. It’s also not recommended for pregnant women or children or people on blood thinners like warfarin. Be cautious where you purchase Spirulina, as it may be contaminated if not bought from a quality source, leading to additional side effects.

Bioavailability: Should it be dried or is live culture better?

Image credit: Ecoduna, Austria If you search for Spirulina online you are mainly going to encounter powdered products. There is nothing wrong with these as most research was conducted on using powdered forms which still showed positive results. However some reports suggest fresh Spirulina has up to 95% bioavailability. This means that 95% of the nutrients including essential amino acids, all the B vitamins and antioxidants are absorbed straight into your bloodstream increasing potency by 45% compared with powder.

How difficult is it to cultivate and commercialize?

Spirulina cultivation requires sufficient aeration, agitation and proper light intensity for enhanced biomass yield, cell productivity, specific growth rate and protein content. Biomass yield has the potential to reach up to 12g/l biomass in a closed reactor system. Urea seems to be a promising alternative source of low-cost nitrogen for Spirulina cultures and addition of mechanised aeration will significantly increase yields.

But what about algal blooms? Are they the same Cyanobacteria?

Spirulina itself is non toxic but other forms of blue green algae including Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, grown and harvested in the wild, is often contaminated and leads to toxic conditions when out of control.

Blue-green algae occurs naturally in lochs, ponds, reservoirs, rivers and the sea. This summer in Scotland it became a real issue. When the conditions are right, blue green algae will create massive blooms so large they can be captured by satellite imaging from space. Blooms are accelerated by leaching of fertilisers, with nitrogen and phosphorus runoff into the water course which becomes detrimental to other life forms by blocking oxygen and releasing toxic microcystins.

So it’s a logical step to grow these in a controlled environment and if market conditions continue to accelerate consumer demand for functional foods then growing these super algae in CEA could be highly profitable for farmers.

Image credit: Earthrise The largest US producer of Spirulina is based in California and they produce on an open 108 acre site, exporting to over 20 countries worldwide. There are disadvantages of open ponds as they do not reach high biomass productivity due to the difficulty of maintaining the optimum temperature and so they are restricted to tropical and subtropical regions. This is mitigated to some extent with large paddles constantly moving the ponds.

Despite this hefty competition, CEA could be the perfect vehicle for growing a crop that has incredible health properties, sequesters CO2 and can be grown in tubing to eliminate contamination. With LED lights and agitation, enhanced yields could be harvested year round.

This could be particularly useful between the shoulder winter months to increase profits and farm skills where wholesale prices have the potential to return profits of up to $15/Kg . A rough estimate of 12g/L biomass can be achieved with a photobioreactor system incorporating PPFD 166 μmol photons m−2 s−1 with potential doubling every 2-6 days depending on the algal species chosen. Based on this, and assuming you harvest 50% at each doubling time, a microfarm running 100L tanks could harvest 0.6Kg every 2 days, giving a total annual yield of 106.2Kg and a potential maximum annual return of $1593. Scaling up production will make more economic sense. Optimizing and automating additional technology (LED lighting, CO2 enhancement and state of the art infrastructure as seen with Algaennovation) may boost production but this must be carefully managed to balance a return on investment.

Learning and applying new ideas – food, fuel & carbon trap

Image courtesy of Energy Futures living laboratory project, Lille France We like to get people talking about the future diversity of CEA. This helps drive innovation and creates wider jobs and skills. At the same time we aim to help you better understand the science and health prospects of plants that could be grown in CEA. Of all the ideas out there, maybe our favourite is the idea of an algae curtain. Glow in the dark tubes of algae obscure prying eyes from your space while producing your own superfood or fuel. Could plants literally fuel plants in a completely carbon neutral circular economy? Biodiesel produced using algae contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and highly biodegradable. This could have potential in offsetting CEA energy outputs and algae fuel cells could make home farms more economically sustainable in the future. There are so many applications for algae, some are even using it to extract CO2 from brewing. Whatever reason you have for growing Spirulina and others (chlorella) there is no doubt about this being classed as a superfood.

Closer to home we like the way CEA farmers are looking to diversify their product range and kudos to On the Grow farms in Rockwall, Texas, growing spirulina alongside their microgreens. They grow in demijohn bottles adjusting the salinity to 2 and pH 10.5-11, harvesting and topping up fresh water every day. In order to maintain high pH and avoid fluctuations, high amounts of sodium bicarbonate must always be included in the culture medium to buffer the solution. The water needs aeration and temperature needs to be tightly regulated to 80F. LED lights will speed up production and your farm will literally bloom. Image credit: On The Grow Farms, Texas

Spirulina first rose to fame as a potential space food. Maybe in space our brains are altered by gravity to be more accepting of blue food. Or maybe we will discover a whole new superfood bacterial species on Mars or deep in the ocean. So who’s got a spare shelf in their vertical farm for this blue superfood and space age protein milk shake? Janet Colston PhD is pharmacologist with an interest in growing ‘functional’ foods that have additional phytonutrients and display medicinal qualities that are beneficial to human health. She grows these using a range of techniques including plant tissue micropropagation and controlled environmental agriculture to ensure the highest quality control.

Phycocyanin Pigment from Microalgae Biofilms Cultured on Wastewater,"New research published in Frontiers in Energy Research has demonstrated a process for cultivating microalgae biofilms in photobioreactors to produce these commercially important chemicals using wastewater.

Phycocyanin pigments are vital for multiple industries, having various important commercial applications. Producing them from gas and oil wastewater presents a sustainable waste valorization process that fits the aims of the circular economy concept.

Phycocyanin

Phycocyanin, along with allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin, is a pigment-protein complex. It is a water-soluble light-harvesting phycobiliprotein with a characteristic light blue color and is an accessory pigment to chlorophyll. Phycocyanins are produced by cyanobacteria.

There are numerous commercial and scientific uses of phycocyanin. It is used as a natural food coloring, in nutritional supplements (for example, spirulina,) as a coloring in cosmetics, and as fluorescent markers in immunological assays. It is also used in animal feeds and aquaculture. Additionally, it contains anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and antiviral properties, making it an attractive target for therapeutics and drugs within the biomedical industry.

Using Petrochemical Wastewater for Microalgae Culture

The petrochemical industries produce large volumes of wastewater globally as a result of oil and gas extraction. Over 90% is re-injected into formations or disposal wells for recovery. Treatment ponds are used to store most of the remaining wastewater. If disposed of untreated into the environment, wastewater can cause significant levels of pollution, affecting vulnerable ecosystems.

Using produced wastewater for the cultivation of algae is a huge opportunity for the valorization of waste streams in the oil and gas industries. This can be used for nutrient recovery, with the biomass used for beneficial purposes. A 2017 study has found that whilst produced wastewater has high salinity and organic compounds that are detrimental for algae growth, important inorganic nutrients which microbes use for growth are present, which is advantageous. Produced wastewater can therefore be used as a culture medium.

Additionally, there are indications that using produced wastewater for microalgal cultivation can be used for biofuel production as well as microbial wastewater treatment. Another recent study has demonstrated the possibility of utilizing microalgal cultivation for nutrient removal.

The majority of current investigations into using produced wastewater as a microalgae cultivation medium have focused on using microalgal biofilms for biofuel production. Conversely, there is limited research into the production of valuable bioproducts. Integrating side streams of valuable bioproducts into processes using microalgal biorefineries could help reduce the costs associated with microalgal wastewater treatment and biofuel production.

The recovery of phycobiliproteins such as phycocyanin and their derivative products can be easily integrated into microalgae biorefinery operations, and the water solubility of phycobiliproteins means that they do not interfere with the recovery of denser liquids. Thus, integrating them into these operations can optimize operations and add value to them.

Suitable substrates for microalgae biofilm growth have been identified in the current literature, with over 15 different materials so far explored. Cotton-based materials have been identified as the best-performing options.

The Study

The main purpose of the new study published online in Frontiers in Energy Research is to evaluate the influence of growth materials and light intensity in a rotating algae biofilm reactor on phycocyanin production. LLC2, a strain of cyanobacteria, was chosen for its ability to form biofilms in different light and substrate conditions. High levels of turbidity and good solid biomass production were identified as key factors in the choice of the reactor for the study.

The team constructed a 2000-liter outdoor-produced water pond at Utah State University. The pool was operated between August and September due to favorable outdoor temperature and the pond was shaded to control light intensity. Out of the materials tested for biofilm growth substratum, the cotton rope was identified as the best option.

Amongst the experimental observations in the study, low light LLC2 biofilms produced twice the amount of phycocyanin per biomass yield compared to high light biofilms. An accompanying crude extract purity (just above the benchmark standard for food-grade phycocyanin) was observed. The authors concluded that different production goals could be achieved by adjusting the light level for biofilm culture.

Based on their experimental observations, the authors have stated that future studies should concentrate on producing other high-value products from microalgae cultures in produced wastewater. Additionally, amongst other future research directions suggested in the study, the potential value of cyanobacteria biofilms to produce valuable bioproducts such as fertilizer, feed, biofuels, and biogas should be assessed in studies.

"""The challenge is to get the consumer to see microalgae not as a supplement, but as a regular ingredient in their diet""","A visionary, sustainability-focused project by Portugal's leading cement producer Secil, which was looking into alternatives to offset its greenhouse gas emissions, resulted 14 years ago in the creation of what would become one of the largest microalgae producing companies in Europe.



Allmicroalgae facilities.

""The Allmicroalgae project was launched in 2007 with the objective of using microalgae for the capture and mitigation of the CO₂ generated in the cement production process. In 2009, after the first crops had been grown in a trial microalgae production plant, Secil decided to go a step further and built and put into operation a 1-hectare plant that today is part of our facilities. In these 12 years, Allmicroalgae's investment has reached 15 million Euro,"" says the company.



Photobioreactors.

The cultivation of macro and microscopic algae has experienced remarkable growth in recent decades, favored by their high biomass generation capacity and photosynthetic efficiency. According to FAO's global statistics on fishery and aquaculture production (FishStatJ), this sector, which is part of the European Union's so-called blue economy, key to achieving the EU's ambitious climate and environmental objectives, grew by 6,300% between 1950 and 2019, going from 0.56 million tons to 35.82 million tons in those 69 years. Its development, even today, isn't free of challenges, although the benefits of this kind of aquaculture are substantial at multiple levels.

""As regards the food industry, microalgae are rich in protein, contain all the essential amino acids, and have a high chlorophyll content and a lipid profile, with 60% polyunsaturated fatty acids. Microalgae such as Chlorella vulgaris are also rich in vitamins, such as B12, and minerals, including iron, potassium, phosphorus and calcium.""



Yellow, green and white Chlorella vulgaris, and organic Chlorella capsules.

""Regarding environmental benefits, in addition to capturing CO₂, microalgae have the capacity to accumulate heavy metals and are known to be able to clean up 'waste' and could be a potential solution within a circular economy approach. At Allmicroalgae, various food-grade eluIds/wastes are also being tested to produce microalgae biomass without interfering with the quality and certifications we have."" Specifically, Allmicroalgae has had the EU organic certification for the production of Chlorella vulgaris since 2018, making it the only European company with large-scale organic production. Later, in 2021, it obtained the EU organic certification for the production of Spirulina, and also has the GMP + FSA, GMP and Kosher certifications.



Spirulina.

Also, microalgae can be used as biofertilizers and biostimulants in agriculture, can be the basis for animal feed and are an alternative and sustainable source of energy.

How are microalgae produced?

""As far as production systems are concerned, it is common to see new reactors and other innovations in the literature. But in our opinion, the production depends more on the biology than on the production systems themselves, mainly because Asian countries are already successfully producing large quantities and the technology already exists. When it comes to processing techniques, the reality is different. This is an area that is still under development.""



Raceway.

""Our production process for industrial microalgae species is unique, very flexible and very demanding in terms of quality assurance. The strains are kept in the most suitable conditions for cell division, and when they reach high concentrations, they are transferred to a larger volume with more space to allow them continue growing,"" says the Portuguese company based in Pataias. ""Chlorella microalgae can grow autotrophically or heterotrophically. At Allmicroalgae, green Chlorella vulgaris is produced biphasically. Initially, the inoculum is produced by fermentation and later in photobioreactors (under outdoor conditions). In addition to green Chlorella vulgaris, Allmicroalgaae also produces yellow and white Chlorella vulgaris. These products are very attractive, as the final product's organoleptic characteristics (color, taste and sensory profile) are improved.""



Allmicroalgae photobioreactors.

""Allmicroalgae also produces Spirulina and markets it naturally dehydrated in the form of paste or powder.""

A growing industry in Europe and America

These high value added products can have different applications, according to Allmicroalgae. ""They can be taken as a daily supplement in capsules or used directly in smoothies, soups, bakery products, etc. Our microalgae are marketed in the B2C market under our Allma brand and in the B2B market, both in Portugal and in some export markets.""



Allmicroalgae microalgae products.

The microalgae market already has a long history in Asia, but in Europe and America it only started 2 decades ago. And the data published in FishStatJ confirm it. According to FAO statistics for 2019, Asia - with China at the head - produces 97.2% of the microalgae cultivated globally. ""However, this industry is growing everywhere,"" says Allmicroalgae, ""and the biggest growth is being recorded in the regions with the greatest momentum right now: Europe and America.""

""In fact, we expect this growth to continue and microalgae to become more present in various gastronomies. Europe and America have just started to produce microalgae and key players in the food industry are increasingly interested in this sector, given the different applications it could have in their current portfolio. Another relevant issue is the vegan trend, which is leading consumers to look for plant-based protein sources, and microalgae can become a very good alternative, given their nutritional profile.""



Allmicroalgae's microalgae products.

But there are still challenges for the industry, and one of the biggest is scaling up the production while guaranteeing a similar nutritional profile in every batch, they say. ""For the consumers, the biggest challenge will be to introduce microalgae in the regular diet, so that people won't consume them only as detox products, in weight loss diets or as purely healthy foods. The industry, with its R&D teams, is trying to find different applications with which to include microalgae in food so that price, taste or convenience won't be an issue. The challenge is to make consumers see microalgae not as a supplement, but as a regular ingredient,"" says Allmicroalgae.

Portugal, one of the pioneers in the microalgae market

Microalgae are a key component of the marine environment. Approximately 80% of the algae species in the oceans belong to this category, whose industry, as highlighted by the European Union, will help achieve the objectives of the European Green Pact. And companies like Allmicroalgae are actively involved in the transition to a sustainable blue economy on the continent.

""At AllMicroalgae, we are already expanding our production site to be able to meet our targets, and future expansions will depend on the demand. We conduct trials every year with different species because we are still in the early stages of microalgae production, so it is extremely important to focus and invest in research and development. There is still plenty of market potential.""

""Portugal has a huge coastline, and it is part of the Portuguese DNA to be close to the sea and to try finding new ways. The macroalgae industry has already been developing for a long time, so given the good weather conditions that the country has, it was only a matter of time before microalgae attracted the attention of some entrepreneur.""

New study gives algal treatment green light,"A team of Scottish researchers has discovered that green LEDs could hold the key to extracting a valuable ingredient for natural health and wellbeing supplements from microalgae.

The feasibility study, funded by the Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre (IBioIC) with support from Algae-UK, was led by the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) and Xanthella, an Oban-based company specialising in photobioreactors – a type of technology that uses light to accelerate the growth of various microorganisms, including algae.

By exposing microalgae to a range of different colours of light, the project team found that green light, in particular, could enhance the production of fucoxanthin, a pigment commonly used for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant dietary supplements.

‘While we are still at a very early stage of what could be a new Scottish supply chain for fucoxanthin, the results of this study could have significant commercial benefits. Discoveries like this show the real value of applied research projects and we now have an opportunity to share what we have discovered with the wider algae and aquaculture sector. It has also led to further collaboration between SAMS and Xanthella and we are continuing to look at the impact of LED light treatment to influence and control the growth of microalgae for different purposes,’ said Professor Michele Stanley, associate director for innovation at SAMS.

The global market for fucoxanthin is still in its infancy, but is expected to grow to more than £245 million by 2027 and, while usually harvested from wild seaweed, the results of this project could lead to the development of an entirely new supply chain.

Researchers found that the highly targeted process, largely using green light, was much more efficient than using a standard photobioreactor settings and, therefore, required less energy to deliver significant growth. Manufacturing the pigment this way, instead of extracting it from seaweed, is also much more controlled, less impacted by seasonality and offers a more reliable level of output.

The study showed that around 20% of the treated microalgae could be extracted directly as fucoxanthin, with numerous opportunities to use the remaining biomass for other valuable purposes, such as biofuels, bioplastics or high-protein animal feeds.

‘It is widely understood that blue and red wavelengths of light are important for photosynthesis in plants, but it was surprising to see that green light could also boost growth in microalgae too. Using LED light, the aim of our photoreactors is to mimic other climates and recreate the conditions that cause algae to create different pigments, but with a much greater degree of control,’ commented Douglas McKenzie, chief executive of Xanthella.

‘In terms of next steps, we need to consider how the process can be scaled up effectively, determining the optimal conditions to create the largest proportions of high-value pigment from the least amount of biomass.’

As well as fucoxanthin, products derived from microalgal pigments are commonly used in a range of household and industrial products, such as spirulina, also used in diet supplements, and astaxanthin, a red-coloured pigment used in certain animal and fish feeds. Over the years, synthetic alternatives have been developed, but targeted microalgae production could open up a much more sustainable method of manufacturing them.

‘Innovation and collaboration can help us to improve Scotland’s sustainable manufacturing capabilities. The development of bio-based alternatives, such as those derived from microalgae, will be key to reducing our reliance on petrochemical-based products,’ said Liz Fletcher, director of business engagement at IBioIC.

‘More efficient production can also reduce our reliance on imports and we look forward to seeing what this study could lead to. Our ambition is to support the growth of the bioeconomy, and a key part of that is connecting research teams with industry partners, whom can work together to create a more sustainable Scottish economy.’",,[],['Quentin Bates']
[Startup Bharat] How Thrissur-based Zaara Biotech is solving malnutrition problems with microalgae-based food products,"Najeeb Bin Haneef, Founder and CEO of ﻿Zaara Biotech﻿, found his calling in 2016 while pursuing his biotechnology engineering degree from Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology.

Speaking to YourStory, Najeeb explains that he began working on an academic project to research and develop food products using microalgae. The team collaborated with the Indian Council of Agriculture and Research's Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (ICAR CIFT) and began advanced research and development of the food products. He later incorporated this project as a separate business named Zaara Biotech in 2019.

Thrissur-based Zaara Biotech focusses on research in energy and food crises using microalgae such as Spirulina, Hematococcus, and other edible seaweeds. It has currently developed B-lite cookies using micro-algae, which is commercially available across India.

Najeeb explains that the idea is to solve problems related to malnutrition and lack of proper diet among people.

“Cookies are something that people across age groups can eat. We designed Spirulina-based B-lite cookies, which includes healthy ingredients such as oats, quinoa, and organic whole millets, among others, which is not only filling but will also ensure one gets all the nutrients,” he adds.

Spirulina, a type of non-toxic blue-green algae, is a natural source of vegan protein and includes nutrients such as vitamin B, beta-carotene, and vitamin E. Spirulina is also reportedly considered a superfood and is used in health supplement products as well.

Healthy snacks

The biotech startup, fostered under the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (IEDC) scheme of Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), is aimed at developing personalised algae-based food products to ensure people get proper nutrients.

It currently offers Spirulina-based cookies in various flavours such as masala, chocolate chips, nutmeg, and quinoa, among others, through both online and offline channels.

Najeeb explains that Zaara is aimed at developing food products that will be specific to regional tastes and needs, and will also cater to people across age groups and pregnant women so that they can get all the nutrients.

Zaara Biotech’s B-lite cookies were exhibited at the Global Goals Model United Nations (GGMUN) conference held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2019. This year, in February, the cookies were exhibited at Gulfood, the world's largest annual food and beverage trade exhibition in Dubai.

The startup also received a strategic investment of $10 million from UAE-based TCN International Commerce earlier this year. As a part of this deal, Zaara Biotech is expanding its presence in the UAE and is looking to develop other food products such as noodles and cakes, among others.

“We have developed and designed photobioreactors to cultivate micro-algae. We are now using the micro-algae to not only develop food products, but are also working to develop cosmetics such as face packs, face creams, toothpaste, and also animal feed and fertilisers,” he adds.

Business and more

Incubated at Sahrdaya Technology Business Incubator, Zaara’s B-lite Cookies are currently available on its official website and on Amazon. Apart from this, the startup also works with distributors for offline sales and is currently available in 10 stores across the country.

“We are currently clocking in about 3,000 to 6,000 online orders and about 10,000 orders from our offline channels per month. We are also providing R&D consultation services to other companies,” Najeeb says. He did not disclose the names of the clientele.

He says the startup is currently looking for investments and partnerships with Indian MNCs and companies for research and development services in food, cosmetics, feed, fertilisers, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceutical products, and also further strengthen its market in India.

According to the Allied Market Research report, the global spirulina market is expected to reach $897.61 million by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 10.5 percent from 2020 to 2027.

In India, health supplement startups such as Oziva and Kapiva Ayurveda also provide Spirulina-based supplements.

Najeeb explains that while Spirulina-based supplements in the shape of pills, powder, and medicine are already available in the market, Zaara Biotech is looking to blend them into food products, which can be consumed by all.

Speaking about future plans, the startup said it is looking to launch its short expiry cosmetics products made out of algae and seaweed by 2022.

“Apart from that, we are looking to export our food products like cookies, cakes, and noodles to 10 other countries, and we are working on the certifications for the same. All the products are being developed keeping in mind the taste preferences and health requirements of different geographies,” Najeeb adds.
