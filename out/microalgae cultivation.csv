The Benefits of Microalgal Biomass

There has been growing interest in utilizing algal biomass for the manufacture of several products. This valuable resource has been explored for use in the food industry, pharmaceutical industry, and biofuel industry.

Microalgae can be cultivated on land which would otherwise be unsuitable for food production. Moreover, microalgal biomass can be grown on non-arable land, avoiding issues with using land that is needed for food production. Furthermore, wastewater sources can be used for microalgal production. This avoids the use of water that is otherwise needed for drinking and crop irrigation.

Compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, and pigments can be produced from microalgal biomass, making it an attractive source of raw materials for many industries. Moreover, the high accumulation of biomass with the minimum of land and water use makes this resource a significant research target for industry.

Using Microalgae for Biodiesel Production

Biodiesel has been proposed as a replacement for conventional fossil fuel-derived diesel. Food crops such as sunflower and rapeseed are commonly used to produce biodiesel, and their use consumes valuable resources such as land and water. Due to high lipid contents, microalgae have been proposed as a resource for biodiesel production.

There are challenges with utilizing this valuable raw material for biodiesel synthesis, however. Issues with high energy and material costs for cultivation and processing exist, and oils produced from microalgal biomass are still unable to compete with mineral oils. Because of these issues, there has been an intense research focus in recent years on improving the efficiency and reducing the energy-intensiveness of microalgal biodiesel production.

The Study

The new study has reviewed current research into synthesizing biodiesel from microalgal biomass. A brief overview has been given on preparation, transesterification, and oil synthesis technologies. In particular, attention has been given to the parameters which influence the efficiency of transesterification processes and resultant biodiesel yield.

The economic efficiency of biodiesel synthesis has been explored in the review, as well as the environmental, physical, operational, and chemical properties of microalgal biodiesel. One hundred and seventy-two papers in the current literature have been reviewed by the authors.

Review Findings

Several findings have been presented in the review, providing perspectives on current research and technologies in the field of microalgal biodiesel synthesis.

The authors have identified that there are certain specificities that govern the production of biodiesel from microalgae. The presence of cell walls in microalgal cells requires methods that break them down before oil extraction can occur. Mechanical and non-mechanical methods have been explored, with high-efficiency methods such as microwave treatment and ultrasonication receiving significant research attention.

Methods to break down cell walls can be used in combination with methods for transesterification and oil extraction. However, due to the presence of elevated levels of saturated fatty acids and free fatty acids compared to traditional vegetable oils, direct transesterification using alcohols and alkaline catalysts is unsuitable. Free fatty esterification methods using organic and mineral acid catalysts are required.

Homogenous catalysts such as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide are commonly used for oil transesterification. Heterogenous catalysts have received attention in recent years, such as metal oxides.

Enzymatic preparations of heterogenous catalysts have shown particular promise for the synthesis of biodiesel from microalgae. These preparations provide simultaneous esterification of free fatty acids and transesterification of triglycerides. However, using enzymatic catalysts is expensive, so research has focused on regenerating and reusing them.

Recent research has demonstrated that the performance characteristics of microalgae-derived biodiesel are almost comparable to conventional biodiesel. Studies have demonstrated that an 80:20% mineral diesel/microalgae biodiesel mixture significantly reduces harmful exhaust emissions and has additional benefits such as maximum rise pressure rates.

Future Trends

The review has highlighted that currently, microalgae-derived biodiesel cannot compete with mineral oil diesel economically. Drawbacks such as higher energy and material costs hinder the widespread commercialization of this green fuel alternative.

Future strategies which can improve the competitiveness of microalgae biodiesel include co-production of valuable chemical products, simultaneous cultivation of valuable food resources such as fish and shellfish, and microalgae cultivation in other technologies. These include biogas production and upgrading and wastewater treatment. The authors have proposed these as future research focuses.

Carbon-capture to feed startup sets up pilot plant in Denmark,"The pilot unit is located at the Danish Technological Institute (DTU) in Taastrup, Denmark. That institute has secured access to laboratories, facilities, and competencies within the microalgae cultivation area.

The idea is that Algiecel’s container-based photobioreactors, using microalgae organisms, will capture CO2 for conversion into high value commodity products such as omega-3 oils and protein to be used in food and feed products.

Juan Farré, president and CEO of the DTU, said that “the opening [of the pilot facility] marks the establishment by the Danish Technological Institute of an ecosystem giving start-up companies access to an integrated platform of testing and demonstration facilities within the space of future foods and the green transition.”​

In March, we reported that Algiecel had received funding of around £400K (US$525K) from Denmark’s BioInnovation Institute (BII) for the construction and testing of the carbon capture pilot plant.

At the launch of the pilot operations, Jens Nielsen, the CEO of BII, said he was impressed by how quickly Algiecel has advanced to this stage, that it is now initiating experiments at pilot scale. “But speed is unfortunately important as we rapidly need new technologies like the ones Algiecel is providing to make sure that we can create a sustainable society.”​

Mobile solution

The photobioreactor technology is easy to install, scale and operate, said the founder of Algiecel, Henrik Busch-Larsen, in March. He is the former CEO of single cell protein pioneer, Unibio.

As the Algiecel solution has been made mobile it can thus be installed with ease at a biogas or fermentation plant where CO2 emissions, he added. The plan would be to have several such container units installed at the one site to fully capture the carbon emitted.

Revenue-sharing concept

The startup is looking to champion a new revenue-sharing business model to offer carbon capture as a service to industrial clients.

Busch-Larsen said he started Algiecel mid-2021, with the vision of making CO2 removal cost-neutral.

He and the team have designed a business model that looks to transform the cost challenge of CO2 removal and potential emission penalties into a profitable business opportunity across the entire value chain: “Carbon emitters would need to invest in the photobioreactor but, when we start producing omega-3 oils and protein, the revenue from sales of those derivative products will be shared with the clients so, over time, the process would be cost-neutral, with clients, eventually, running a small profit off the back of their CO2 problem.”​",,[],['Jane Byrne']
Algae could help fuel the future. But it's not easy being 'green',"Algae could help fuel the future. But it's not easy being 'green'

On a patch of land between Riverview Park and the Red Mountain Freeway, two silvery metal domes tower over the Mesa wastewater treatment plant. The domes are called “anaerobic digesters,” and there are several hundred of them in the U.S.

Inside each dome, tiny organisms — bacteria — break down biological waste. But this story isn’t about bacteria. Because here in Mesa, there are some new microorganisms on the block.

Three oval-shaped ponds swirl with brilliant green water in a dirt lot below the domes. Floating in the lazy river-like current, swaths of tiny life forms glisten in the sunlight.

Algae.

Scientists in Arizona have been cultivating algae for several years, but this time, ASU researchers are working on a project with the city of Mesa in hopes of turning wastewater byproducts into fuel and other products. They want to harness the way algae naturally works to coax another use out of the gases that would otherwise be emitted as a result of the necessary process of breaking down human-produced wastewater.

The algae — more specifically microalgae, which are microscopic, single-celled organisms closely related to seaweed — take in carbon dioxide (the gas that humans breathe out) much the same way plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to create their own food.

“We’re taking advantage of that. We’re using waste as food for the microalgae,” said Justin Flory, the associate director of research in the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions at Arizona State University and the manager of the algae project.

Algae-based biofuels and products have been a dream for researchers and companies for several years, including for teams at ASU and the University of Arizona. In 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act called for 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels, including microalgae-based biofuels, by 2022. Algae biofuels are not yet produced commercially, according to the EPA.

Now, as the need for energy independence and security grow more urgent in the U.S., algae still isn’t being produced at a scale large enough to power cars, planes or anything else that requires energy. Meanwhile, many scientists say we need to electrify everything, fast, to meet climate goals, with the potential for dire consequences if we don’t.

Flory and other Arizona researchers think algae will play an important role in the move to a sustainable future. In the uncertain zone between where we are now and complete decarbonization, they say algae-based biofuels offer solutions for some of the toughest problems of the energy transition. Those include, for instance, addressing the limitations of intermittent power sources like solar and wind, reducing the impact of heavy transportation like cargo ships and, of course, improving the sustainability of unavoidable emitting processes like treating wastewater.

But for algae to reach its potential, its cultivators are up against big challenges. There are biological hurdles: Much like growers of agricultural crops on dry land, algae farmers need to achieve ideal conditions to maximize yields (and some even want to use genetic modification). Then there’s the task of converting a pond of green gunk into fuel, a design problem that engineers, chemists and other scientists are still trying to perfect.

Algae projects are most sustainable when combined with other processes, like wastewater treatment, something big companies and investors aren’t always aligned with. And beyond biology or technology, there are problems of infrastructure and policy. For algae to work, leaders and companies need to care about it.

The team at ASU, working with the city of Mesa, think they have a start on a local level. But Flory acknowledged that continued efforts of science and investment, on a local and commercial scale, will be needed to make more progress.

“It’s not something you can just flip a switch and say, we’re going to get the answer, and we’re done,” Flory said. “It takes a lot of people trying, failing, learning, (and) trying again.”

Cultivation challenges

Margarita Acedo was one of those people who wanted to keep giving algae a try. When she moved to Tucson in 2010, she had two goals.

One was to learn English, a task that took her only a few months. But the other goal was much bigger. She wanted to find better ways to cultivate microalgae to create alternative forms of energy.

Acedo, who started as a volunteer and went on to earn her master’s degree and doctorate in chemical and environmental engineering at the UA, worked at Viridos (formerly Synthetic Genomics), a California-based company that recently partnered with ExxonMobil to develop algae biofuel.

Acedo thinks the hardest part of making algae biofuels a reality will be the “transition from the lab to the field.” Before researchers can do anything with algae, they have to grow it. So Acedo has worked on projects that study the effects of light, nitrogen, heat and more on algae yields, which will be critical to understand if algae is to be grown on a commercial scale.

It might grow in water instead of a field, but she sees algae as a crop. So does Everett Eustance, an assistant research scientist at ASU who has been working with Flory on the wastewater project.

“Here (on our project at ASU), they keep track of it, make sure it’s growing healthy. You have to make sure the fertilizers and everything is correctly done just like any other farm crop,” Eustance said.

And much like farmers, algae cultivators won’t be able to control the weather. That, Acedo says, is a gap that needs to be addressed between research and reality.

“All of what we (were) producing (was) at the R&D stage,” Acedo explained of her time at Viridos, “so most of the things (algae researchers are) producing is data.""

Another decision for researchers growing algae, including Arizona teams, is whether to grow algae in environments that are open or closed to the outside world. To grow the vast amounts of algae needed to produce biofuels on a large scale, cultivators need big ponds. Smaller, closed systems tend to work well, but the size is limited, and they’re more expensive. When ponds are outside, wind could contaminate the algae or introduce dust.

“You can grow them in closed reactors, but they’re a lot more capital intensive. You need a ton of landmass to be able to cultivate enough algae to make a huge dent in your biofuels,” said Kimberly Ogden, professor and department chair of chemical and environmental engineering at UA. Ogden was Acedo’s Master’s and doctoral advisor while Acedo was a student and has been focused on biofuels and bioproducts for over a decade.

One solution to the space problem? Trying to increase the amount of oil the algae produces. Acedo says that’s a project other scientists have been working on at Viridos. Just as land-based farmers might use a genetically modified crop variety that produces higher yields, algae researchers are applying similar techniques to try to get more biofuel bang for their buck.

In the meantime, bright sunny places like California and Arizona remain important for studying algae growth.

“Arizona is a great place for (algae cultivation) because of how much sunlight we have,” Ogden said. But in the desert, water usage is a big concern. “At some point we might get a water problem, because there’s a lot of evaporation off of there.""

That’s something Flory and his team hope to address by working directly with a wastewater plant. Since the process already involves reclaimed water, it’s less of a burden on water systems.

“If you’re attaching them to wastewater treatment plants, that’s a good idea,” said Ogden, who was not involved with the ASU project.

But even with the right algae strains and the growing location set up, there’s more work to be done to make microalgae fuel viable.

Scaling up: The role of infrastructure and integration

At one of the ponds at the Mesa site, Eustance dips a gloved hand into the green water. He pulls out something that looks like a woven rug, or maybe old parchment: a square mat made up of long, white fibers connected at each end with a length of metal.

This is where the magic happens.

When the microalgae “eat” the waste from the anaerobic digesters, they do two useful things. They leave behind a purer form of methane (another type of gas) that can be pumped into existing natural gas systems as “renewable natural gas.” And they also grow more of themselves, creating “biomass,” which can eventually be converted into biodiesel or other products like fish feed or even synthetic materials used to make sneakers.

But to get that waste from the metal dome into the algae ponds, scientists need a go-between.

“They’re like little hollow drinking straws, but very small. And that lets the carbon dioxide … get delivered to the microalgae,” Flory explained. “What comes out the end of those drinking straws is the methane, which you can use as natural gas.”

The natural gas you're most familiar with is probably the kind that formed deep underground, as a result of plant and animal matter decomposing under pressure over millions of years. Extracting it often involves building deep wells or fracturing rock formations at high pressure in a process commonly called fracking.

This natural gas is different. It ultimately serves the same purpose as other natural gas, and it still emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when it’s burned for fuel, but it didn’t take millennia to form. And in this particular case, because it’s attached to a wastewater plant, it’s getting two uses out of the same greenhouse gases that would be emitted no matter what as a result of the waste in wastewater breaking down.

“It’s a way of separating the carbon dioxide from the methane and using (the methane) for a productive purpose,” Flory said.

That separation is important because methane is a particularly harmful driver of climate change. Both carbon dioxide and methane are so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and drive the warming of the planet. But methane is about 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide, according to an assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

If methane gets separated out and burned as fuel before being emitted, it breaks down and releases carbon dioxide (it’s not perfect, researchers say, but it’s a lot better than releasing methane). For that to happen, Flory says he and his team are working on making those special gas-delivery fibers more efficient. Going into the fibers, there’s about 40% carbon dioxide and 60% methane. Flory estimates that right now, by the time the algae is done with it, it’s closer to 85% methane.

Flory is aiming for an even better 97% methane.

It’s all part of a plan to make their system as cheap and efficient as possible. That includes reducing the energy needed to create the current needed for the algae by using the paddle wheels attached to the ponds.

To tackle those infrastructure challenges, researchers need more investment that will allow them to fine-tune a relatively new process.

“One of the biggest challenges we have compared to corn ethanol or any other terrestrial (biofuel crop)? We don’t have the existing infrastructure,” said Eustance, noting that farmers on land already had everything in place they needed to cultivate plants like corn. “Right now, it’s tricky. There’s a lot of unknowns, too, because we’re still very much (on) the small scale.”

Acedo understands why companies like ExxonMobil might be necessary to transition from that small scale to commercial-scale projects. “We need the money of an investor,” she said.

But she isn’t necessarily convinced that oil and gas companies like Exxon will be interested in integrating algae infrastructure on a local level with projects like wastewater treatment, something that Arizona researchers, both on and separate from the ASU project, agreed would be important for the highest climate impact.

Acedo described how energy companies, similar to ExxonMobil, have been cultivating large algae ponds in Europe, with what she believes is the aim of diversifying an energy portfolio commercially rather than with a focus on sustainability.

“When you are actually integrating different processes, like wastewater treatment … that’s when you make it more sustainable,” Acedo said.

Casey Norton, a spokesperson for ExxonMobil, did not answer when asked about whether the company was working on integrating processes like wastewater treatment as part of its algae biofuel strategy. Instead, he described the work with Viridos on developing genetic tools for better cultivation, as well as other biofuel projects not using algae, which some scientists have pointed out have the potential to be land-intensive and inefficient.

“Algae is one part of our portfolio approach to researching, developing and deploying lower-emissions technologies,” he said in an email.

A mindset shift

Even though some big companies might see financial green when they look at algae, Flory says he thinks most people, if they have heard of it at all, see algae as a nuisance, something that blooms in recreational areas, kills fish and generally makes life more difficult.

That hasn’t stopped scientists like him from communicating about the allure of algae as an innovative climate solution. “It’s pretty in some ways, it’s got beautiful colors to it. I think most people don’t really know much about what it is,” Flory said.

But with that beauty comes a reality: As literally green as algae may be, it will take a bigger paradigm shift for investments in algae energy to pay off, both economically and environmentally.

John Giles, the mayor of Mesa, is optimistic about the algae project, which he touts as an investment in innovation. And he thinks that innovation will be non-negotiable if climate goals are to be achieved.

“Last year, we adopted a climate action plan that is very aspirational, but also we want it to be achievable,” said Giles, noting that he believes Mesa’s plans are on par with those of cities across the world.

“We don’t know how we’re going to do this (attain climate action goals), but we’re going to set these goals and we’re going to hope the technology evolves,” he said, adding that “the technology we need to achieve these goals doesn’t exist.”

The lag between technology and implementation is a roadblock facing the energy sector as a whole and part of the reason Flory thinks biofuels will be needed to make the transition to cleaner energy sources possible.

“The reality is today we can’t easily go to 100% (renewables) because so far, we don’t have the capacity to really do that,” he said, citing technology challenges involved in storing intermittent power sources like solar and wind.

Ogden agrees that there won’t be one solution to the energy challenges of the future, and thinks “we’re a long way off from not using any carbon to do things” She noted that algae-based biofuels are of particular interest for airplanes and cargo ships, which have not yet been electrified.

Unless there’s a carbon tax or the market changes significantly, she says fossil fuels will continue to be too much cheaper than renewable sources for there to be any economic incentive for decarbonization.

That’s why Flory hopes that integrating their project with wastewater treatment, which he says has always been a burden for society as well as for the climate, will help the technology gain traction. Though wastewater treatment only accounts for 1% of Mesa’s overall carbon footprint as outlined in their climate action plan, it’s also something that society has already agreed needs to be paid for, an idea that’s been slower to catch on for carbon emissions.

“Ultimately, it comes down to, ‘is carbon dioxide emissions enough of a problem that we think we should pay for it in some regard?’” Flory said. “I think we’re going to need those (kinds) of policies and (a) mind shift to make (algae biofuels) really scalable.”

Mukesh Ambani's RIL to make biofuel out of algae soon; check details here,"Mumbai-headquartered energy to telecom bellwether Reliance Industries (RIL) announced that it will be making fuel using algae soon. RIL confirmed the development in an Instagram post.

The company handle shared a 51-second-long video clip of the same and wrote, “Fuel from algae? You heard that right! Our scientists have developed cutting-edge innovative capabilities for algae strain development, cultivation, and harvesting. This has unlocked endless possibilities such as the production of biofuel, bio-chemicals and nutritional food and feed.”

The post further read, “RIL is innovating in green and renewable energy sources to keep pace with India’s fast-growing energy needs.” It further stated that these innovations are reflective of RIL’s commitment to meeting India’s energy requirements and doing this in a sustainable way so that India can meet its UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Reliance Industries is not the only company to talk about making biofuels. Earlier this year, energy giant ExxonMobil announced that it is committed to attain net-zero ambitions by building on its 2030 emission-reduction plans. These plans include net-zero emissions for Permian Basin operations and investments in lower-emission solutions including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuel, as per a press release dated January 18.

Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil Darren Woods said, “We believe our strategy is unique among industry and enables us to succeed across multiple scenarios. We will create shareholder value by adjusting investments between our existing low-cost portfolio and new lower-emission business opportunities to match the pace of energy transition.”

But how do scientists convert tiny plants like algae into fuel? According to Harvard Political Review, scientists usually grow microalgae in large, open ponds or enclosed photobioreactors. At scale, the microalgae need to grow in open air.

After this, scientists harvest algae, break down cell walls using chemical solvent and extract inner lipids, proteins and carbs. Inner lipids, proteins and carbs then undergo final processing which turns them into biofuel.

Meanwhile, Reliance Industries shares are 1.42 per cent down at 2,625 apiece on the BSE, as of 3:24 pm.",,[],[]
Microalgae-based animal feeds could fill protein gap,"Why the future of protein production could be green and slimy

Algae may be the king of renewable super-plants with myriad potential applications ranging from biofuels, pharmaceuticals and biofertilizer to animal feed and human food.

Algae grow faster than conventional crops and require fewer resources — only a little sun, water and CO 2 , making it one of the most sustainable raw materials on earth. In fact, 1 kg of algae biomass can store almost 2 kg of CO 2 while releasing 1.6 kgs of oxygen.

Algae’s sustainable qualities help it stand out as a frontrunner in the alternative protein game. As more restaurants, grocery retailers and food brands implement sustainability initiatives across the supply chain, algae-derived ingredients are poised to gain popularity.

“It doesn’t require arable land, which is a huge advantage over crops,” said Michael McGoldrick, market manager Industrial BioTech/Starch, GEA. “Some species also do well in brackish or salt water, which means you aren’t fighting over the same resources as the other crops.”

However, production costs are a big challenge for today’s algae producers. That’s why investment in processing technologies are ramping up while efforts are underway to expand the algae market in the future.

Filling the protein gap — with plants

By the middle of this century, we’ll need more than an additional 250 million tons of protein to feed the world’s projected population. To bridge the protein gap, researchers and processing equipment suppliers are eyeing single-cell organisms — the kind of algae that contain up to 70% protein — for solutions.

GEA is one of several partners from the EU’s scientific and business community to form the Sustainable Algae Biorefinery for Agriculture and Aquaculture (SABANA) project in 2016 to focus on refining algae to support sustainable food production.

McGoldrick identified several factors driving interest and investment in the development of plant-based alternative proteins.

“The market is looking for a functional, complete protein as customers have shown a high interest in plant-based alternatives due to environmental and health beliefs,” McGoldrick said. “There are very few complete plant proteins with the full amino acid profile that humans need, so the easiest way to get around that is to blend various plant proteins, including microalgae.”

Microalgae, or phytoplankton, can provide valuable proteins, pigments and unsaturated fatty acids, along with loads of untapped opportunity. Bühler Group is another company actively engaging with the industry and academia on novel technologies to unlock the full potential of single-celled microorganisms for food and feed production.

Bühler Group’s experts estimate 200,000 to 500,000 microalgae species exist in nature, yet only about 20 species are being commercially explored today. Commercial production of more algae species could help replace a significant amount conventional crop-based animal feed protein demand in the coming decades.

Microalgae market expansion hurdles

One of the biggest challenges microalgae production faces is cost-related – partly because the algal biomass must be processed to separate it from the water it was grown in. And accessing the nutritional benefits of some microalgae relies on opening the cell wall to allow for optimal digestibility.

Getting to the highest added value, functional ingredients from microalgae often require a cell disruption stage. Bühler offers bead milling technology as flexible, energy-efficient solution to open the microalgae wall in suspension. The design allows users to easily validate and optimize their process at lab scale and subsequently scale to industrial capacities, and may one day be key to affordably scaling microalgae production worldwide.

According to McGoldrick, centrifuges are another economical means to efficiently process microalgae due to its biological makeup. This method uses less energy than ceramic membrane filtration and is a better alternative to traditional rotary vacuum filters because cell size can cause binding or blockages.

Companies like GEA and Bühler are actively researching and supplying novel processing systems that don’t compromise the nutritional value of each microalgae cell, but still, more processing innovations are needed to bring microalgae ingredients to the mainstream.

Looking ahead 15 to 20 years, where does McGoldrick predict the research on algae processing and nutrition will take us?

“As the costs of production come down, more and more possibilities open up,” he said. “With GMO algae, there are very few limits — once the economics are figured out.”

Quick algae facts : Plant-based superfood

Size matters. There are two types of algae: macro and micro. Both are food sources that release oxygen into the atmosphere during photosynthesis, but macroalgae is larger, known as seaweed, and is an excellent marine filter. Meanwhile microalgae are microscopic (between 2-10 micrometers), single-celled organisms — commonly known as phytoplankton.

Mermade: Cultivated Scallops Made Using Low-Cost Aquaponics Technology,"Mermade Seafoods is an Israeli company developing cultivated scallops. The company claims to be the first in the world to use aquaponics technology in cellular agriculture.

Aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture (seafood farming) and hydroponics (growing crops in nutrient solutions rather than soil). Essentially, Mermade takes nutrient-rich spent growth medium — a byproduct of cultivated meat and seafood production — and places it in a bioreactor with microalgae. The resulting algae biomass can be used to feed more cells, a circular process with the potential to drastically reduce the cost of cell cultivation.

Mermade says it is focusing on scallops as their shape and texture is relatively easy to replicate. Additionally, conventional scallops are expensive, meaning the cultivated variety will not be significantly more costly.

“We’re making the same seafood that we all know and love, just without fishing,” CEO Daniel Einhorn said, speaking at OurCrowd’s online event ‘Investing in the Circular Economy: From Trash to Cash.’

Reducing the cost of growth media

Cell growth media is notoriously expensive, accounting for a huge proportion of the cost of cultivated meat. This is currently one of the key barriers to the commercial production of cultivated products. The growth medium most commonly used, fetal bovine serum, also comes with concerns about ethics and quality.

Consequently, various companies are working to develop alternatives. Collaborations are ongoing between Meatable and Royal DSM, and between Aleph Farms and WACKER. Others have successfully managed to do away with cell culture media entirely, such as Japan’s IntegriCulture.

“IntegriCulture is the first to implement cell culture by serum-free basal medium that cell-cultured meat producers around the world are working on. There is a wide range of potential industrial applications in cell cultivation such as cosmetics, leather, pharmaceuticals, and others,” the company said.",,[],[]
Microalgae is nature’s ‘green gold’: our pioneering project to feed the world more sustainably,"As a young child in the mid-1960s, my days were spent living an idyllic rural life on a dairy farm in the village of Lewdown in the heart of Devon. I recall many happy days exploring the glorious countryside, living a life in balance with nature and the environment – or at least, that’s how it felt.

But I also remember the ever-present slurry pit full of manure down at the end of our cowshed. It wasn’t fenced off, and my mum would remind me on regular occasions that to stray too close could mean death by drowning in what was, in essence, an enormous vat of smelly cow pats. As a five-year-old, I stayed well clear.

What we didn’t know then was that this pit of farm manure posed not only a hazard to me, but to our environment. Manure, which is often returned to the land as a nutrient fertiliser without consideration of its wider impacts, releases greenhouse gases including methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, and other harmful nitrogenous gases such as ammonia. It can also lead to nitrogen-rich run-off into water courses, polluting rivers, lakes and coastlines – with knock-on effects on fish mortality and tourism.

In short, what I thought was an idyllic childhood, living on a farm in balance with nature, wasn’t quite that. Subsequently, as a bioscientist, I’ve spent much of my life researching microorganisms that can help maintain a healthy planet. Nearly 60 years later, I find myself leading a pioneering Europe-wide project dedicated to transforming potentially harmful waste into something positive. In the process, we can help to build a “circular economy” that regenerates nature and keeps materials in circulation. And at the centre of this work are some remarkable microscopic organisms – our “green gold”.

Jewels of nature

We all know how important trees are in terms of sequestering carbon, yet we tend to overlook the two-thirds of our planet that is covered by water. Our seas and oceans are filled with organisms that are equally vital to the Earth’s life cycles, yet because they are individually less visible to the naked eye than land plants, we largely ignore them.

Microalgae – not to be confused with macroalgae (seaweeds) – are massively abundant in our seas, freshwater lakes and rivers. These tiny organisms are important “primary producers” on our planet, acting as biomass factories. They use sunlight through the process of photosynthesis to convert inorganic molecules (carbon dioxide, nutrients and water) into proteins, fats and carbohydrates, plus a host of other organic compounds that help them grow and survive. These tiny microorganisms support all life in our oceans and, with their high turnover rates, contribute to around 50% of the planet’s primary production.

There are literally hundreds of thousands of species of microalgae. A commonly occurring group are the diatoms, of which there are an estimated 20,000 species. With beautifully intricate, snowflake-like cell walls made of glass, diatoms are true jewels of nature. Another common group are the coccolithophores, covered in elaborate, frisbee-like calcium carbonate chalk plates. During the Cretaceous period, which ended 66 million years ago, enormous blooms of coccolithophores formed the white cliffs of Dover.

As microalgae do not have roots, leaves and stems, they can use carbon dioxide and nutrients more efficiently than land plants, enabling them to grow more rapidly. They can be relatively easily cultivated and harvested to produce biomass crops (“algaculture”) which can be used as food or for bioenergy. Algal biomass also contains a wide range of useful molecules that can be used in bioplastics, biofuel, health products, cosmetics and food ingredients.

My growing appreciation of these fascinating microorganisms, with their amazing ability to grow on waste nutrients and produce something useful, inspired me to want to help address the twin global challenges of sustainability and environmental protection. Using nature’s “green gold” to clean up waste nutrients while also producing sustainable feeds and other products seemed to me a no-brainer.

Back in the 70s, I recall my A-level biology teacher, Mr Montague, introducing us to the carbon and nitrogen cycles and explaining how important the balance of each of these cycles is to life on our planet. I even remember him talking about the greenhouse effect and temperature rise. But we didn’t realise back then just how severe the threat of carbon dioxide-related climate change was – or how nitrogen would emerge as a major contributor to the complex environmental challenges we face today.

Towards a circular economy

To have any hope of meeting our global climate change targets and achieving a sustainable equilibrium, we need to work towards a circular economy that eliminates waste and pollution, keeps materials in circulation and regenerates nature. This must replace our existing linear “use and discard” model which has led to unbalanced nutrient cycles.

In response to this, farmers, the food industry and waste-water companies are increasingly turning to anaerobic digestion (AD) to process their waste. AD is a natural process in which bacteria in large tanks called digestors feed on organic waste – sewage, food waste, farm manure and other agricultural waste – to produce a biogas, rich in carbon and hydrogen, that can be captured and used to generate renewable electricity and heat.

The nitrogen component of the organic waste is retained in a thick liquid called digestate, which can be returned to the land by farmers as a naturally produced fertiliser – preferable to synthetic fertilisers produced using energy-intensive and CO₂-emitting processes. However, as the AD industry has expanded, so the increased production and returning of digestate to the land poses a risk of nutrient pollution.

As a result, many areas in the United Kingdom and Europe are now restricted by the Nitrate Directive and nitrate vulnerable zone (NVZ) legislation, introduced to prevent pollution through excessive use of nitrogen returned to the land. Currently, 55% of land in England is designated an NVZ, while the entirety of Wales is in the process of becoming another such zone.

One way of overcoming this regulatory challenge is through the use of microalgae. And so, in 2017, our Europe-wide, circular economy project called ALG-AD was born. The ultimate goal is to convert nitrogen that poses a risk to the environment into microalgae that can be used in sustainable animal feed, replacing existing, highly resource-intensive sources of feed in the process. Using funding from the INTERREG North-West Europe programme, Swansea University partnered with ten other organisations throughout north-west Europe – a densely populated and intensely agricultural area that is particularly vulnerable to nitrate pollution of groundwater. The whole of Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark are also already designated NVZs.

By recycling unwanted nitrogen into something useful, we can prevent it escaping into the atmosphere and into waterways, thereby reducing pollution to both land and atmosphere. The microalgae naturally convert the nitrogen into protein and other nutritional molecules which can be used back in the food chain. Five years on from the project’s launch, we have already shown that such a circular economy solution is workable on an industrial scale.

A new source of protein

The projected growth of the planet’s population over the next half-century means global food production is expected to increase by at least 50%. We are also all being encouraged to reduce consumption of meat protein to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. New sources of protein are therefore a top priority, and microalgae are strong contenders. Companies such as Nestlé are already researching microalgae as an alternative source of protein, both as animal feed and food for humans.

While the microalgal production industry is still in its infancy, the ability to produce a new source of protein without the issues associated with meat and soya is very attractive. Furthermore, being able to cultivate microalgae close to where they will be used by farmers in animal feed offers another distinct advantage.

A big challenge for our European project has been to test this technology for development at full working scale. We have therefore worked directly with the AD industry as it processes food and farm waste, providing us with industrially produced nitrogen (in digestate) to cultivate our microalgae.

In the UK, just 30 miles from the Devon farm on which I lived as a child, we have built a pilot “algae-AD” facility at an AD company sited next to Langage Dairy Farm. Langage-AD has the capacity to process 20,000 tonnes of food waste a year, producing biomethane that generates heat and electricity. We were provided with a large, heated greenhouse situated right next to where the waste is processed. This was the ideal location for our “algal photobioreactor”, a series of vertical see-through tubes in which microalgae are grown in an aqueous medium containing nutrients that are exposed to both daylight and artificial light.

Two sister photobioreactor facilities have been built in Brittany in France and Ghent in Belgium. All partners have undertaken in-depth studies to determine how to best process the digestate and optimise nutrient uptake. Too much and we found that our microalgae didn’t like it; too little and not much happened.

Promisingly, we have found that microalgae grown on digestate are richer in protein compared with microalgae grown on more typically-used inorganic nutrients, with protein levels reaching up to around 80% of the total biomass produced. This is well over double the amount of protein contained in meat and soya products. In a world where there is an increasing protein shortage and alternatives to meat are sought, this is a real bonus.

Currently, around 75% of the world’s soya crop is used as a source of protein in animal feed. As with beef production, soya production has come under scrutiny for its role in deforestation, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. In addition, the transportation of soya across the globe generates a huge carbon footprint. To top it all, transporting soya to high agricultural areas disturbs the global balance of nitrogen, leading to “nutrient hotspots” and an increase in NVZs.

Our studies have confirmed the potential of microalgae as a protein source to supplement and replace soya protein. However, the scale of microalgal cultivation is currently not big enough to make a significant impact on soya markets. Therefore, our real-life feed trial experiments have so far concentrated on testing microalgae as a food supplement, to improve the health of piglets and of fish. But we know that the market for algae-based animal feed and ingredients is set to grow rapidly.

Rolling out these novel biotechnologies

To date in the UK, we have focused on two commonly occurring freshwater species of green microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus (both from the division Chlorophyta). Both species contain good levels of proteins and a host of molecules with beneficial properties for health, which we are still exploring.

But yet another amazing thing about microalgae is their diversity. There are tens of thousands of other species with a breathtaking variety of form and function, still waiting to be explored.

Now, supported by the groundwork of our research, it is up to pioneering businesses, regulators and investors to work together to enable the roll-out of these novel biotechnologies more widely. As we move to a society and economy more circular than linear, which uses its waste while preventing environmental contamination, it seems that microalgae will become more familiar to us all in one form or another.

Our project has already demonstrated that microalgae have strong potential in helping reduce food security-related issues such as land scarcity, climate change and inefficient and unsustainable fertiliser usage, as well as associated nutrient leakage and water pollution. In so doing, they can be used to raise environmental standards in Europe and throughout the world. Indeed, our work supports the recently announced European Green Deal, promoting the circular economy and protection of nature, and the new Common Agricultural Policy with its strong emphasis on environment-friendly farming practices and agro-ecology.

However, it is still relatively early days. As with any waste-related technology, legislation and regulation needs to be carefully considered. For now, the simplest way forward is to use anaerobically digested vegetable-based waste rather than animal-based waste, thereby eliminating the possibility of any animal waste or animal contamination passing back into the food chain.

We would also like to further increase the uptake of digestate into the algae and, like any new and developing technology, we need to balance up the cost and overall environmental benefits. To achieve this, we are gathering results from across the partnership and consolidating our data for use in life cycle analysis. This will also enable interested farmers, food producers and other industries to decide if the technology is for them, and what they might best achieve according to their particular needs.

Another way microalgae can be used to help in agriculture is as biostimulants – natural products that, when applied in small quantities, enhance nutrition uptake and improve stress tolerance, thus reducing the need for chemical fertilisers. We are also delving further into the many other valuable components within microalgal cells, including molecules that have benefits as human and animal immune modulators, anti-inflammatories and antivirals. The full benefits of microalgae to produce new products are just waiting to be reaped.

Ironically, throughout my working life, I didn’t exactly heed the advice of my mum all those years ago, to stay away from the dangerous mix of nutrients that was brewing in the manure pit at the end of our cowshed. But I would like to think, in not doing so, that I have been part of a revolution in the way we regard and treat waste, ensuring that the valuable nutrients in cow manure and other organic waste can increasingly be used for the benefit of us, and our planet.

Making Bioethanol with Both Fungi and Bacteria,"Bioethanol production has the potential to replace petrochemical-derived fuels for sectors such as the automotive industry. A new paper appearing in the journal Energies has explored the production of this alternative fuel from bacteria and fungi. Researchers from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Ariel University in Israel have contributed to the paper.

Bioethanol: A Green Alternative to Traditional Petrochemical Fuels

The harm that fossil fuel exploitation causes to the environment has been well documented in recent years. Along with the carbon emissions that are produced during manufacture and subsequent use, fossil fuel reserves are becoming depleted, facilitating the search for alternative fuels. Petrochemical production is struggling to keep up with demand as the world rapidly industrializes.

Bioethanol has been widely touted as a green, sustainable alternative to traditional petrochemical-derived fuels. This fuel can be produced from a multitude of natural, renewable resources such as crops and agricultural and food waste. However, producing biofuels such as bioethanol from food crops is not sustainable, as it depends on seasonal production and uses land that can be better purposed for food crops.

Two colors in the columns depicted in the scheme represent two different encapsulated organisms. Each column contains encapsulated micro-organisms for saccharification and fermentation processes. The upper column was packed with T. reesei (TR) cells and the consecutive—with encapsulated S. cerevisiae (SC) cells. The bottom column was packed with encapsulated T. reesei cells and the consecutive column with P. stipitis (PS) cells. (b) The capsule (left panel) consists of an external membrane that encases the aquatic exogenous micro-inoculum and nutrient supplemental specific growth medium.

Traditional bioethanol production also faces problems with water consumption. Many international bodies have highlighted the critical issue of water poverty in several developing nations, and the consumption of this vital resource for bioethanol production is exacerbating this key social issue.

Bioethanol produced from waste lignocellulosic materials and other non-edible resources circumvents these issues. Fuel can be produced from a wide variety of waste products such as straw, forestry residues, and sawdust. These materials have the advantages of not competing with food crops, renewability, circularity, abundance, and seasonal independence.

There are drawbacks associated with using waste materials for bioethanol production, however. Biomass typically must be pre-treated, and conversion processes are costly and complex. To address the technical issues with utilizing food crops and waste materials, research has focused on utilizing microorganism biomass in recent years.

Producing Bioethanol from Microbial Biomass

Microbial biomass has several advantages for the manufacture of bioethanol. Biomass derived from these organisms can be produced cheaply in a short period of time, producing abundant amounts of recoverable materials. One of the main sources of biomass for biorefineries is microalgae.

There are, however, some challenges still to overcome with these processes. It is still a novel field of research, is expensive, has scalability issues, and requires significant amounts of carbon dioxide to produce raw materials. Additionally, there are unresolved environmental, social, and contamination issues.

Biomass pretreatment is an essential step in bioethanol production. Physical treatment and microbial biodegradation are widely employed methods that are considered eco-friendly and can efficiently retrieve valuable products such as polysaccharides. Pretreatment of biomass can also reduce rigidity and crystallinity.

Trichoderma reesei is a widely used fungal species that secretes hemicellulose and cellulase enzymes. This commercial-scale fungus breaks down biomass and produces fermentable monosaccharides which can be metabolized by other micro-organisms such as S. cerevisiae. Using microorganisms such as these can produce high volumes of bioethanol via simple and scalable processes in biorefineries.

To improve the efficiency of bioethanol production from microbial biomass and enhance the stability of processes, several immobilization and bioencapsulation strategies have been explored. However, challenges occur with these techniques such as cell leaks, excessive costs, and limited product and substrate diffusion.

Recently, an innovative process called the Small Bioreactor Platform technology has been developed. Microbial cells are encapsulated without the need for immobilization or absorption on gelatinous matrices. Inside the capsules, the microbes are held in a free suspended state. Capsules are constructed from microfiltration membranes, which have benefits such as higher permeability rates compared to traditional polymeric beads.

The Study

The team behind the paper in Energies has developed a Small Bioreactor Platform process that uses encapsulation of T. reesei, P. stipitis, and S. cerevisiae to continuously produce bioethanol from cellobiose and xylan. Corn core was used as the raw material for xylan production.

Post-encapsulation viability, biological activity, and bioethanol production were evaluated in the paper. Moreover, the authors evaluated the longevity of the process over a period of three months. The authors evaluated two process configurations. The first configuration involved columns of all three encapsulated microorganisms. In the second configuration, separate columns of yeast and fungal cells were used in series.

Study Findings

Physical encapsulation of microorganisms in the process’s medium with abundant nutrients enhances the proliferation of micro-cultures over several weeks. Another benefit of the proposed system is the simultaneous fermentation and saccharification without the need for cell or matrix renewal. A 60-70% system efficiency was achieved, with the goal of continuous production achieved.

The process used low concentrations of substrate materials; therefore, bioethanol yields were low. The authors have stated that future experiments using higher substrate concentrations are needed. Increased residence time leads to prolonged microorganism exposure to substrates and tuning this residence time can lead to controlled process yields. Further studies are needed on other substrates.

At the end of the study, there was no significant change in the structure of the capsules. Furthermore, no changes to microbial cultures were observed. Additionally, the simultaneous nature of the process and prolonged micro-organism viability provides benefits in terms of capital costs and significant improvements in the conversion of sugars to bioethanol.

Whilst further studies are needed, the process demonstrated in the paper is highly promising for the production of sustainable, green bioethanol.

Study backs benefits of LED lighting in microalgae cultivation,"The new study by researchers at CCMAR, in collaboration with Greencolab, Necton and Allmicroalgae has looked into new methods to increase the production of microalgae, in line with rising demand.



Until recently, microalgae were produced in open production systems. However, although this method is cheaper, it also has more disadvantages, one of them being poor light distribution.

To address this problem, CCMAR studied the impact and costs of integrating LED in outdoor raceway ponds. The researchers found that the use of LEDs in cultures of the microalgae Nannochloropsis oceanica increased biomass growth, especially during the night. In addition, they found that the protein and carbohydrate content also increased in the cultures that were under LED exposure. This research presents the possibility to optimise the process of microalgae production at an industrial scale.

However, they add that the incorporation of this type of light should be mainly considered for the production of high-value algal products, since it represents an additional cost in the production of biomass.",,[],[]
Biofuel: how new microalgae technologies can hasten the end of our reliance on oil,"Microalgae have been used by the Chinese for medicinal and nutritional purposes for thousands of years in the belief they could cure almost any health condition. The idea that microalgae have extraordinary healing powers isn’t as far-fetched as some might think. Though the ancient Chinese believed the microalgae was responsible for health-improving benefits, we now know that it was in fact the biochemical compounds produced by these microscopic creatures that provided the “magic”.

There are approximately 100,000 species of microalgae, each with their own distinct set of properties. This diversity allows microalgae to flourish in almost every environment on Earth. Mostly they exist in aquatic habitats such as fresh or wastewater, but they have been found in moist soil – and even snowbanks too.

Microalgae are usually described as being green, and this is true for species such as B. braunii and C. vulgaris. But there are other species, such as C. officinalis, which is red or F. spiralis, which is brown. Each classification produces different types or quantities of biochemical compounds, making some more useful for certain applications than others.

Over the past few decades research has demonstrated the huge potential of microalgae, especially in the production of biofuel – fuel that is created from plant material or animal waste. I wanted to review this research to provide a framework to establish the most suitable microalgae species for large-scale biofuel production that can ultimately rival oil and gas giants and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

The magic of micoalgae

Microalgae have a unique ability to convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into a wide range of biochemical compounds. Despite being classed as animals, they metabolise the same way as plants, producing oxygen to replenish what we humans consume. This cycle acts as a carbon capture system, whereby harmful CO₂ in the atmosphere is converted to useful oxygen. Microalgae also produce a wide range of other compounds found inside the cells, and these are what make microalgae so good at combating the effects of global warming.

Generally, the products from microalgae can be grouped into three classes: proteins, carbohydrates and lipids (fats). But research has found that there are several other high-value biochemical compounds that have significant applications in a wide range of different industries. For example, microalgae produce compounds known as carotenoids, more commonly known as dyes or pigments. These compounds are responsible for giving salmon its pink colour, as the food they eat contains high quantities of carotenoids.

Another high-value class of compounds are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). These compounds are part of the lipid family and play a vital role in supplying the cells with energy. Microalgae have been deemed one of the richest sources of these compounds, which help treat the effects of diabetes and arthritis.

But how is it possible for these organisms to produce oil that can be used in cars? The petrol and diesel currently used is derived from crude oil that was formed millions of years ago from dead sea creatures. But modern biofuel is produced from living organisms on a real-time basis.

How biofuel is produced

Biofuel made from microalgae is currently one of the most promising fossil fuel alternatives to sustain the world’s energy demand. This is no easy task, especially having to compete with a highly profitable industry that has been established for more than a century. But unlike oil, which is non-renewable, biofuel is a renewable and sustainable source of fuel. Unfortunately, the economics of biofuel can’t yet compete with traditional fossil fuels. It all boils down to the bottom line, and currently the scale-up technology required isn’t here yet.

Microalgae don’t directly produce biofuel – they produce lipids (fats). To make biofuel these fats must be converted through a process known as transesterification. The process involves removing as much water as possible, known as dewatering, but this requires significant amounts of energy, resulting in high operating costs. As a result, the overall process becomes too expensive to compete with the oil and gas industry, despite its positive environmental impact.

Economics aside, the future for microalgae cultivation and lipid extraction is extremely promising. The development of hybrid technologies will accelerate the global shift to reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. These include cell factories that use gold nanoparticles – subatomic particles similar to atoms that form the building blocks of physical matter – to increase production rates and increase efficiencies.

Another potential solution is a process known as “milking”. Traditional cultivation methods for microalgae mean they are destroyed after the cultivation period has ended, which limits the full potential of what each cell can offer. Just like milking a cow, the process can be repeated without killing the cow, and the same goes for microalgae. By repeatedly removing high-value compounds from the same culture of microalgae, the high production cost issues can be removed, resulting in a sustainable and scalable process for the future.

This would result in biofuel becoming cost competitive with current fossil fuels, helping to accelerate the shift towards alternative energy sources. Unfortunately, the prospect of competitive biofuel production has some way to go before it can rival fossil fuel prices and quantities. But these developing technologies have the potential to speed up the transition needed to help the world reach its 2050 emissions targets.",,[],['Callum Russell']
‘Microalgae could be cultivated on Mars’: Experts detail less obvious benefits of algae production,"By 2050, it is estimated global populations will reach around 9.8bn. With so many mouths to feed, and an agri-food system that accounts for one-quarter of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, entrepreneurs are on the hunt for food sources that champion both human and planetary health.

An increasing number believe they have found it in algae. Some in macroalgae (or seaweed), and others in microalgae, which unlikely the former, is largely invisible to the eye.

Algae cultivation has some very obvious sustainability benefits, particularly concerning its reliance – or lack there for – on limited natural resources. When grown in the ocean, it does not require any fresh water and is not in competition with landbound crops. It is also cultivated without inputs such as fertiliser or pesticide.

And when microalgae are grown in tanks on land, reliance on natural resources is minimal compared to conventional livestock rearing or crop cultivation.

But there are more sustainability benefits that may be less obvious to the general consumer, suggested entrepreneurs at ProVeg Incubator and Zinitinus’ Future Food Series event last week.

Producing algae-based protein on Mars​

For one, microalgae needn’t be cultivated near the oceans at all. In fact, cultivation systems can be installed in some of the most unlikely places around the planet…and even further afield.

What VP at the European Algae Biomass Association Alexandra Mosch finds particularly ‘cool’ about microalgae production, is that it can grow in closed photobioreactors (PBRs) or open ponds in non-arable areas, such as deserts.

“This means they can also be grown in buildings or on rooftops, or be integrated like…vertical farms,” ​Mosch, who is also an advisory board member at algae supplier Allmicroalgae, told delegates. This could also prove beneficial in terms of food miles, she suggested, since that the majority of people around the world now live in cities.

Given the adaptability of microalgae production systems, it could even be conceived that microalgae-based foods be produced in some of the most desolate landscapes, suggested Eugene Wang, CEO of Singapore-based Sophie’s BioNutrients​.

The start-up, which is in the process of expanding its presence in the Netherlands, ferments microalgae in bioreactors, isolates their proteins, and transforms them into a powder for food formulation.

“It may happen that when Elon Musk wants to shoot people over to Mars, we can potentially set up our technology…system on Mars – identical to the one that we’re going to set up in Europe – and produce protein out of microalgae.​

“Why? Because where there is water, there is going to be microalgae,” ​he explained. “And we can use the microalgae on that planet to [create] food for the new settlers on that new planet.​

“This may be too extreme [a concept] for a lot of folks, but I’m just trying to point out the fact that you don’t really have to be affected by global warming or the weather, and you don’t need a lot of space. You can just use fermentation technology.” ​

How can algae address nitrification?​

Another advantage of algae production, is that when managed correctly, it has the potential to reduce the impact of challenging environmental problems.

Nitrogen and phosphorous pollution is one such issue, with human activities – including excessive fertiliser use in conventional farming – largely to blame.

As nitrogen and phosphorous in the water encourage algae to grow, water systems can quickly become overrun, resulting in algal blooms. Algal blooms can be toxic, and have been known to kill fish, mammals and birds.

But is there a way for nitrogen and phosphorous pollution to be leveraged for good? Tel Aviv University spin-off Genesea​, which is making protein isolates and other ingredients for plant-based food manufacture from offshore marine macroalgae, is investigating a solution.

“We need nitrogen for seaweed to grow,” ​explained co-founder Alex Golberg. “So one of the first things we did, a few years ago, was to create a global map of locations where there are…both natural nutrients coming up from the bottom of the ocean to the surface, and nutrification – where…fertilisers wash off from agriculture to the sea.”​

These are areas Genesea predicts could prove fertile for seaweed farming.

Golberg also stressed the relevance of ocean currents. “We knew that any type of nutrient that you put [in the sea] will immediately disperse somewhere else. So you need to locate the farm in an area where the current [transports] the nutrient supply.”​

In a similar vein, Jacob von Manteuffel, co-founder of German brands BettaF!sh and Nordic Oceanfruit​ – which both use ocean-cultivated seaweed in their food products – sees this as a ‘huge opportunity’ to close the cycle.

“A large amount of the phosphates and nitrates that we put into our agricultural systems end up in the ocean and it’s a huge waste of resources. It has some very bad impacts on our ecosystem in the ocean, and by cultivating seaweed, we have the possibility to close the cycle and gain back nutrients we really can’t afford to lose right now.”​

Do we need to make seaweed cultivation more sustainable?​

There is some concern that ocean-cultivated algae will not be the silver bullet many hope it will be. Growing seaweed can, indeed, create environmental problems in the oceans when high density cultivation causes biomass degradation and methane production.

“It can actually convert into a big swamp in the middle of the ocean. This could happen,” ​said Genesea’s Golberg.

However, there are ‘a lot’ of projects underway, by the European Union and others, to explore how seaweed can be grown in a sure-fire environmentally friendly way. “Meaning that there will be enough light available to all other organisms that live here.” ​

One solution could be to build cases that allow sufficient amounts of light into the ocean, the co-founder continued. “All these are real problems that exist, and the communities are aware of them and the solutions are coming.”​

Is seaweed farming at risk of significantly harming the environment? GettyImages/Kanawa_Studio

Is seaweed farming at risk of significantly harming the environment in this way anytime soon? BettaF!sh and Nordic Oceanfruit’s von Manteuffel is not convinced.

“We are destroying our oceans globally, taking people’s resources by massive fishing fleets…and then we calculate if seaweed farming could at some point speculatively have a negative impact. That’s hypocrisy…​

“Seaweed farming is very small still and there is huge potential. It’s far from being harmful…”​",,[],['Flora Southey']

The green seaweeds segment is projected to be the fastest growing, in terms of value, during the forecast period.

The emerging use of green seaweeds in other application areas such as biofuel production and wastewater treatment is expected to drive the market growth further. Initiatives by the UK Department of Transport to double the use of biofuel in 2020 are expected to have a positive impact on the demand for green seaweeds. Green seaweeds such as Ulva and Enteromorpha are used for the removal of toxins from industrial wastewater. It is also used as a bioremediation tool.

The food segment is projected to account for a major share in the market during the forecast period

Seaweed is used as an ingredient in food products and is consumed directly in countries such as Japan, Korea, and China since ancient times. As it is rich in nutrients such as high iodine, calcium, magnesium, iron, vitamin, antioxidant, and fiber, seaweed, is widely considered a healthy food. Moreover, seaweeds have various applications as a thickening and gelling agent in processed food products such as sausages, bread, creams, cheese, dairy drinks, and candies. In addition, the use of seaweeds for the manufacturing of low-calorie ice creams and cakes is further projected to fuel the market growth.

Asia Pacific is projected to dominate the regional seaweed cultivation market through 2025

Due to the increasing presence of tropical rainforests in the Asia Pacific, various species of seaweeds are found in this region. With a wide variety of seaweed species in this region and increasing production of the seaweed-based products, Asia Pacific remains the largest supplier of seaweeds to both domestic and export markets. In addition, the bulk of seaweeds in this region is obtained from culturing (harvested through aquaculture). The key seaweed types that are in demand in this region include nori, kombu, and wakame. They are increasingly used in food preparations in the Chinese and Japanese diets. As seaweeds are nutrition-dense and are increasingly used as an ingredient in processed food, consumers prefer spending on processed food for healthy diets. The demand for clean labels and organic products is on the rise, which is also leading to the increasing use of seaweeds as organic fertilizers in the agriculture industry. The other industrial applications of seaweeds in the region include pharmaceuticals, agriculture, cosmetics, biofuel, and feed additives. These factors are projected to fuel the growth of the seaweed cultivation market in the Asia Pacific. Of the various countries in the Asia Pacific, China and Indonesia are projected to account for a major share of the market.

"Looking to bolster the environment and the economy, farmers and scientists cultivate a viable kelp industry","On a gray morning in late April, Suzie Flores, 40, the owner of Stonington Kelp Co., hustled out of her hybrid Highlander in a Westport parking lot. She grabbed a couple of coolers of freshly harvested Connecticut sugar kelp from her SUV, then dashed to the rear entrance of a posh restaurant to deposit 60 pounds or so of seaweed. Because the weather was breaking—for the better, for once—she hoped to hightail it back to Stonington to help her husband, Jay Douglas, work his barge on the Pawcatuck River before their weather window closed.

The climate, it’s changing, and this has wreaked havoc on Connecticut’s fledgling kelp harvest this year. Waters too warm delayed finding wild kelp seed in the ocean last fall. Winter storms disrupted kelp lines at farms along the Connecticut coast. Ferocious winds postponed harvesting trips this spring.

But the half dozen or so people cultivating kelp in Connecticut are a hearty lot, determined to grow the state’s seaweed crop to a respectful place alongside farmed clams, mussels and oysters in Connecticut’s $30 million aquaculture industry, according to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture reports.

Flores, her peers and a handful of researchers, entrepreneurs, academics, scientists and chefs believe Connecticut kelp can bolster the state’s economy and might help heal the environment in the process.

In 2016, Flores and Douglas bought a small marina in Stonington and moved their young family into a fixer-upper across the street. The hyper-seasonal nature of marina work—kayak rentals, a bait and tackle shop, moving boats to and from neighboring Watch Hill—left an open window in wintertime.

Flores did some investigating. About a decade ago, lobstermen and scallop farmers in Maine began growing kelp in the winter because the growing schedule complemented their summer work, and they already had the necessary gear to harvest. While Flores was intrigued, kelp’s nutritional and environmental benefits sealed the deal, she said. Kelp is one of the most nutrient-dense foods on Earth, with an alphabet full of vitamins and minerals from A to zinc and more calcium per ounce than milk.

Like plants growing on land, kelp uses sunlight for photosynthesis, absorbing carbon in the process. Kelp also removes nitrogen and phosphorous from water, making it nature’s water purifier. A study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in February found that shellfish and seaweed farms remove about 575 pounds of nitrogen per acre. Kelp is a zero-input plant, which means it doesn’t need land, fresh water or added fertilizer to grow. Sugar kelp’s translucent amber ribbons provide a hideout for marine life, which generate all the fertilizer the kelp needs.

Flores connected with GreenWave, a Connecticut-based nonprofit committed to regenerative ocean farming, which helped her navigate the Connecticut Bureau of Aquaculture’s 18-month permit process. Farmers here say that timeline is speedy compared to other states, where permitting can drag on for years. GreenWave helped Flores set up her farm, supplied her with seeds and connected her with buyers.

Each fall, Flores sets out with a contingent of scuba divers to forage wild kelp beds in the Atlantic Ocean for sorus tissue, or reproductive tissue, for seed. Last fall, divers couldn’t find any sorus tissue in the usual spots. Due to climate change, warmer waters had chased wild kelp beds further east into the Atlantic. “We took the divers out as frequently as they needed to go. We were just trying to see if there were sources that we were missing,” Flores said. Eventually, they located spores, but the delay affected the entire growing season.

Foraged spores are sent to a nursery of sorts in New Haven. There, at GreenWave’s hatchery on the Quinnipiac River, spores are released into giant fish tanks, where they attach themselves to a special kind of kite string. After a month or so of growing in the nursery, seeds emerge—tiny kelp blades about a millimeter long. The fuzzy-looking seed strings are spooled around PVC pipes, then transported in coolers to farms throughout southern New England. At sea, farmers unfurl the kite string onto ropes suspended several feet deep between two moorings. The kelp grows downward and can reach more than 10 feet before being harvested.

Setting these lines, or outplanting, usually happens around Thanksgiving. But last year’s delays meant that Flores and Douglas spent New Year’s Eve bundled up on their boat in the Atlantic, setting the half-inch-thick roping.

“Every week that you have to wait to outplant your farm is a week’s less growth,” Flores said. “Shortening the amount of growth can mean the difference of a couple of thousand pounds.”

Last year, Flores harvested more than 13,000 pounds of Connecticut sugar kelp.

Environmental benefits

Each pound removes substances in the water that might otherwise feed dangerous microalgae, reports Charles Yarish, Ph.D., a University of Connecticut professor whose Stamford lab has one of the most significant collections of seaweeds in the world. Yarish said pollution flows into Long Island Sound from sewage treatment plants, which carry waste and fertilizer run-off, and from the atmosphere. “Seaweed aquaculture gives coastal managers another tool in their toolbox to remove [potentially dangerous] nutrients in the coastal water. These farmers provide an ecosystem service to the public.”

Yarish started studying seaweed aquaculture in the early 1980s when he realized during a sabbatical that the United States has an “exclusive economic zone,” or ocean area over which a nation has jurisdiction, of more than 11 million square miles. “An astonishing number,” he said. Why wasn’t the United States using this coastal zone to grow seaweed, which could bolster food safety and security, and generate economic and environmental value? “I basically said we have such an opportunity in the oceans to do something for the greater good of people. But nobody was interested. They basically said, ‘Let the Asians provide the product to the U.S.’”

He went to Asia to investigate. In China, he saw huge swaths of coast carpeted by fish and seaweed farms and nearby “huge areas of industrial development,” releasing waste into the same watercourses that fed those farms. He believed the U.S. could do better. At UConn, he developed the Seaweed Marine Biotechnology Laboratory and, slowly, became one of the foremost seaweed cultivation experts in the world. He received funding from Connecticut Sea Grant, which continues to support kelp aquaculture research, and established research farms at the western end of Long Island Sound, in the East River in New York, and in Fairfield off Jennings beach.

Wooed with noodles

A start-up in Maine asked the professor to help it provide U.S.-harvested frozen kelp noodles to consumers. The partners wooed him with dinner—kelp strands cut a little thicker than spaghetti, served with olive oil and butter and a heap of mussels, clams and North Atlantic shrimp. Yarish was hooked. He offered to help the company on one condition: all their resulting innovations be available to anyone who asked.

Yarish and the partners developed tools to make farming and processing less labor-intensive and published an ocean-approved kelp manual that started with how to collect sorus tissue and grow it in a nursery and ended with recipes for the food on the plate. Connecticut Sea Grant funded a similar, more scientific manual for scientists. UConn libraries hosted the work, and Google Scholar picked it up. More than 10,000 people downloaded Yarish’s how-to kelp manual.

If only he could cultivate more farmers to grow the product.

Yarish’s graduate students suggested that he spread the word through YouTube videos, which might appeal more than a manual to folks working in fishing communities. Yarish proved to be the ideal emissary, with his bushy mustache and zeal for dangling fistfuls of drippy, springy kelp in front of the camera. His videos garnered tens of thousands of views.

One of those evangelized was Bren Smith, a former Newfoundland fisherman who owns Thimble Island Oyster Farm in Branford Harbor. Smith had become wary of commercial fishing practices and was searching for more sustainable ways to make a living without destroying the very environment he relied on to ply his trade. In addition, hurricanes had walloped his shellfish business, which damaged his spirit as well as his bottom line. Seaweed seemed to be the right answer at the right time.

Yarish said he found in Smith “not only someone who listened, but someone who could communicate with people who worked on the water, and with other entrepreneurs.” Smith bought into Yarish’s open-source philosophy, in which one kelp farmer helps another. The professor brought in ocean engineers, and Smith drew up plans for long lines, harvesting and more. Smith’s kelp farm in the Thimble Islands would serve as a working laboratory, with planting and harvest documented, tested, sampled, and recorded, and results passed along to the Department of Aquaculture, which runs its own tests for heavy metals, and to Connecticut Sea Grant, which ensures seaweed safety.

Next, Smith started GreenWave to train other kelp farmers. “We thought this will be nice, helping out local folks,” he said, “but 8,000 people signed up for the farmer training program.” So GreenWave changed strategies, offering how-to videos to train whoever was interested. Last month, GreenWave launched the Regenerative Ocean Farming Hub, a “seed-to-sale” resource that provides free training, tools and community to more than 1,000 kelp farmers nationwide.

In Connecticut, 15 commercial kelp-fishing sites from Greenwich to Stonington have permits. But because of mounting challenges, only three commercial farmers, including Flores, harvested in 2022. “It’s all wind dependent. We’d get out to the farm, and there were 3-foot waves smashing on the side of the boat. You can very easily get yourself wrapped up in a line or get your boat swamped. It was too dangerous, and sometimes we’d have to turn back,” she said.

Yarish, Smith and Flores say the state’s kelp business could grow with state-supported infrastructure: hatcheries for seed and processors to blanch and freeze or dry kelp. “It’s a big challenge,” Flores said. “Kelp is a temperature-controlled food. You can’t just pull it out of the water and slop it on your deck. It’s regulated, like shellfish.”

They’re hoping Connecticut Sea Grant, an early supporter of kelp cultivation research here, can help find a path forward. Last year, the group was awarded $766,650 in federal funds to help develop, plan and manage a viable seaweed cultivation industry. In addition, the group’s aquaculture specialist, Anoushka Concepcion, who helped establish the National Seaweed Hub in 2019, was named last year to the United Nations’ Safe Seaweed Coalition.

In the meantime, farmers like Flores will continue to supply fresh sugar kelp to chefs from Greenwich to Hartford to Stonington. By Smith’s count, anywhere from 1.3 to 1.5 million pounds of kelp will be harvested and sold this year in New England. Depending on the weather, that is.",,[],[]

Phycocyanin pigments are vital for multiple industries, having various important commercial applications. Producing them from gas and oil wastewater presents a sustainable waste valorization process that fits the aims of the circular economy concept.

Phycocyanin

Phycocyanin, along with allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin, is a pigment-protein complex. It is a water-soluble light-harvesting phycobiliprotein with a characteristic light blue color and is an accessory pigment to chlorophyll. Phycocyanins are produced by cyanobacteria.

There are numerous commercial and scientific uses of phycocyanin. It is used as a natural food coloring, in nutritional supplements (for example, spirulina,) as a coloring in cosmetics, and as fluorescent markers in immunological assays. It is also used in animal feeds and aquaculture. Additionally, it contains anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and antiviral properties, making it an attractive target for therapeutics and drugs within the biomedical industry.

Using Petrochemical Wastewater for Microalgae Culture

The petrochemical industries produce large volumes of wastewater globally as a result of oil and gas extraction. Over 90% is re-injected into formations or disposal wells for recovery. Treatment ponds are used to store most of the remaining wastewater. If disposed of untreated into the environment, wastewater can cause significant levels of pollution, affecting vulnerable ecosystems.

Using produced wastewater for the cultivation of algae is a huge opportunity for the valorization of waste streams in the oil and gas industries. This can be used for nutrient recovery, with the biomass used for beneficial purposes. A 2017 study has found that whilst produced wastewater has high salinity and organic compounds that are detrimental for algae growth, important inorganic nutrients which microbes use for growth are present, which is advantageous. Produced wastewater can therefore be used as a culture medium.

Additionally, there are indications that using produced wastewater for microalgal cultivation can be used for biofuel production as well as microbial wastewater treatment. Another recent study has demonstrated the possibility of utilizing microalgal cultivation for nutrient removal.

The majority of current investigations into using produced wastewater as a microalgae cultivation medium have focused on using microalgal biofilms for biofuel production. Conversely, there is limited research into the production of valuable bioproducts. Integrating side streams of valuable bioproducts into processes using microalgal biorefineries could help reduce the costs associated with microalgal wastewater treatment and biofuel production.

The recovery of phycobiliproteins such as phycocyanin and their derivative products can be easily integrated into microalgae biorefinery operations, and the water solubility of phycobiliproteins means that they do not interfere with the recovery of denser liquids. Thus, integrating them into these operations can optimize operations and add value to them.

Suitable substrates for microalgae biofilm growth have been identified in the current literature, with over 15 different materials so far explored. Cotton-based materials have been identified as the best-performing options.

The Study

The main purpose of the new study published online in Frontiers in Energy Research is to evaluate the influence of growth materials and light intensity in a rotating algae biofilm reactor on phycocyanin production. LLC2, a strain of cyanobacteria, was chosen for its ability to form biofilms in different light and substrate conditions. High levels of turbidity and good solid biomass production were identified as key factors in the choice of the reactor for the study.

The team constructed a 2000-liter outdoor-produced water pond at Utah State University. The pool was operated between August and September due to favorable outdoor temperature and the pond was shaded to control light intensity. Out of the materials tested for biofilm growth substratum, the cotton rope was identified as the best option.

Amongst the experimental observations in the study, low light LLC2 biofilms produced twice the amount of phycocyanin per biomass yield compared to high light biofilms. An accompanying crude extract purity (just above the benchmark standard for food-grade phycocyanin) was observed. The authors concluded that different production goals could be achieved by adjusting the light level for biofilm culture.

Based on their experimental observations, the authors have stated that future studies should concentrate on producing other high-value products from microalgae cultures in produced wastewater. Additionally, amongst other future research directions suggested in the study, the potential value of cyanobacteria biofilms to produce valuable bioproducts such as fertilizer, feed, biofuels, and biogas should be assessed in studies.

Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,"Fecal Filtration

Although biofilters, a form of green stormwater infrastructure, have the capability of increasing water quality, the filtration of human pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that are found in water sourcing from stormwater runoff is not well reported. Researchers from UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science & Management — Marina Feraud, Dong Li, Patricia Holden, Laurie Van De Werfhorst and Timnit Kefela — have studied the efficiency of a breakthrough field-scale biofilter in Southern California. The researchers tested its ability to remove microbial markers and bacterial and viral pathogens from exposed water. They observed high variability in the removal of different microbial contaminants and ARGs. The biofilter significantly removed 14 of the 17 microbial markers when introduced to a 50:50 mixture of untreated sewage and stormwater. In contrast, no significant removal was documented in the other three markers: GenBAc3, Campylobacter and HF183. The results recorded in this study pose further research potential and questions about using human-associated fecal source markers as tools for pathogen removal.

Ghost Gear

Abandoned, lost and discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) have long been obstacles in the field of marine conservation and continue to pose a threat to both marine organisms and field researchers.The adverse consequences of ALDFG are vast and range from the potential transport of invasive species to the distribution of harmful microalgae. They further include the obstruction of marine vessel navigation and “ghost fishing.” Ghost fishing is a process in which discarded fishing nets and other gear continue to catch and kill organisms long after fishermen have abandoned them, and is one of the most infamous results of derelict fishing gear.

The extent of the environmental impact, however, depends on the drivers (i.e., the fisheries) which, in turn, depend on the region and scale of their work as well as the characteristics of the gear they are using, such as gear type and material. Therefore, any viable solutions must be context-specific. Six researchers, including UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management adjunct professor Jono Wilson, compiled comprehensive databases in order to help streamline the development of solutions to these problems. The databases include various ALDFG causes, potential mitigation methods and “enabling conditions” to effectively manage these problematic marine debris items. This study and the databases will allow stakeholders to identify mitigation approaches that can be matched to distinct, local situations so that solutions are fishery-specific. It is hoped that these databases will direct the allocation of resources in order to effectively combat this incredibly damaging phenomenon.

Food to Fumes

Aquaculture and mariculture are methods of food cultivation that are becoming increasingly important for food supplies across the globe. While these methods have led to greater accessibility to food sources, their expansion has resulted in an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The influx of these gases, including methane and carbon dioxide, are large contributors to climate change. With China being the leading producer of agricultural and mariculture cultivation, UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management visiting scholar Kangshun Zhao worked with researchers from the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences to conduct a study that quantified GHG emission levels that were directly from aquaculture and mariculture production in China. They analyzed the carbon footprint of the four phases of the production process (feed, energy use, nitrous oxide and fertilizers) over the course of 10 years to show the spatial distribution of the emissions. The findings showed that feed production was the greatest contributor to GHG emissions as a result of crop energy use, crop land-use changes, fertilizer production and rice methane production. The regional gross domestic product was positively correlated with emissions in every province, with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.6. These results revealed that China’s aquaculture had a lower emission intensity compared to the findings of Macleod et al (2020) due to the higher percentage of bivalve (an aquatic mollusk) production. The results suggest that China’s carbon footprint can be reduced by adjusting the relative proportion of species-group production and decreasing the amount of energy use.

ProVeg incubator targets mushroom and microalgae-based alternative-proteins,"Seven start-ups have joined the incubator to develop the next generation of sustainable foods, “without animals and without comprising on taste, texture, or functionality​”, explains Albrecht Wolfmeyer, Head of the ProVeg Incubator.

The global team have expertise in the three major approaches to alt-protein production: plant-based, fermentation, and cultivation.

This includes Colombian start-up, Fotortec, that has developed a scalable, circular system to produce mushroom-based ingredients using oyster mushrooms that grow on vegetable waste. Fotortec can upcycle vegetable waste (that would normally be discarded) using a technological process that mimics the way vegetable biomass is recycled in nature and addresses the universal problem of food waste.

Meanwhile German innovator, EatMyPlants, is developing microalgae using a fermentation process. One of the benefits of microalgae cultivation is that it does not compete with land and resources required for traditional crops and has a superior yield compared to traditional crops. It is high protein and exhibits “a huge potential to meet the dietary requirements of growing population”​, according to research supplied by ProVeg.

“The ProVeg Incubator is bringing together a powerhouse of young start-up founders,”​ Wolfmeyer comments.

“Our latest cohort leverages cutting-edge ingredients like microalgae and fungi and creates novel ingredients like heme and dairy proteins for the alt-protein industry​.”

Accelerating innovation​

ProVeg’s incubator programme harnesses innovation from global start-ups to accelerate the development of “disruptive alternatives​” to animal-based products. The eighth round began on April 4 and will run online for 12 weeks.

Since it launched in 2018, the programme has collaborated with more than 60 start-ups globally and has collectively raised more than £192m (€230m).

Participants have access to a broad network of industry contacts, exclusive events, and co-working spaces. Each company is assigned an expert mentor, with one-on-one coaching once a week, and can benefit from marketing and media support and funding of up to £209,000 (€250,000).

The current incubator group also includes companies from the US, Canada, India, Germany, and Israel, are: OceanTastes, Biofect Innovations, Rewild Solutions, Culminate Foods, and Fabumin and are developing cultured seafood, meat-like products, cultured fat, and a plant-based alternative to the protein found in egg whites, respectively.

Global change​

ProVeg International is a non-profit organisation established to transform the global food system by replacing animal-based products with plant-based and cultured alternatives. The organisation’s mission is to reduce global animal consumption by 50% to 2040.

It is made up of multiple national organisations, each of them generating revenue in a variety of ways, such as through private donations, trusts and foundations, the V-Label and membership fees.

The organisation brings together decision-makers, businesses, investors, the media, and the general public to initiate change and help society and economies transition to a more sustainable system of food production.

The 12-week accelerator programmes are led by experts and include workshops and coaching sessions, a test kitchen, industry meet and greets, and various events to provide start-ups with the skills, knowledge, funding, and support they need to succeed. Each incubator culminates in an investment-focused Start-up Demo Day.",,[],[]

UCLA Researchers Develop Novel Microscopic PicoShell Particles,"Production of high-energy fats by microalgae may provide a sustainable, renewable energy source that can help tackle climate change. However, microalgae engineered to produce lipids rapidly usually grow slowly themselves, making it difficult to increase overall yields.

UCLA bioengineers have created a new type of petri dish in the form of microscopic, permeable particles that can dramatically speed up research and development (R&D) timelines of biological products, such as fatty acids for biofuels. Dubbed PicoShells, the picoliter (trillionth of a liter), porous, hydrogel particles can enable more than one million individual cells to be compartmentalized, cultured in production-relevant environments, and selected based on growth and biomass accumulation traits using standard cell-processing equipment.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recently published a study detailing how PicoShells work and their potential applications.

PicoShells consist of a hollow inner cavity where cells are encapsulated and a porous outer shell that allows for continuous solution exchange with the external environment so that nutrients, cell-communication molecules and cytotoxic cellular byproducts can transport freely in and out of the inner cavity. The shell also keeps the small groups of growing cells penned in, allowing researchers to study and compare their behaviors — what they do, how fast they grow, what they produce — to those of other groups inside various PicoShells.

This new class of lab tool allows researchers to grow living, single-cell microorganisms — including algae, fungi and bacteria — under the same industrial-production conditions, such as in a bioreactor filled with wastewater or an outdoor cultivation pond.

“PicoShells are like very tiny mesh balloons. The growing cells inside them are effectively fenced in but not sealed off,” said study leader Dino Di Carlo, UCLA’s Armond and Elena Hairapetian Professor in Engineering and Medicine at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering. “With this new tool, we can now study the individual behaviors of millions of living cells in the relevant environment. This could shorten R&D-to-commercial production timelines for bioproducts from a few years to a few months. PicoShells could also be a valuable tool for fundamental biology studies.”

PicoShells’ permeability can bring the lab to the industrial environment, allowing testing at a sectioned-off area of a working facility. Growth can occur more quickly and cell strains that perform well can be identified and selected for further screening.

According to the researchers, another advantage of this new tool is that the analysis of millions of PicoShells is automated since they are also compatible with standard lab equipment used for high-volume cell processing.

Massive groups of cells, up to 10 million in one day, can be sorted and organized by certain characteristics. Continuous analysis could result in ideal sets of cells — ones that are already performing well in the environment with suitable temperature, nutrient composition and other properties that could be used in mass production — in just a few days rather than the several months it would take using current technologies.

The shells can be engineered to burst when the cells inside have divided and grown beyond their peak volume. Those free cells are still viable and can be recaptured for continued research or further selection. The researchers can also create shells with chemical groups that break down when exposed to biocompatible reagent, enabling a multifaceted approach to release selected cells.

“If we want to zero in on algae that are the best at producing biofuels, we can use PicoShells to organize, grow and process millions of single algal cells,” said lead author Mark van Zee, a bioengineering graduate student at UCLA Samueli. “And we can do that in machines that sort them using fluorescent tags that light up to signify fuel levels.”

Currently, cultivating and comparing such microorganisms are done mostly using traditional lab tools, such as microwell plates — cartons that hold several dozen small test tube-like volumes. However, these methods are slow and it is difficult to quantify their effectiveness because it can take weeks or months to grow large colonies for study. Other approaches, such as water-in-oil droplet emulsions, can be used to analyze cells in smaller volumes, but surrounding oils prevent the free exchange of medium into the water drops. Even cells or microorganisms that perform well in lab conditions may not do as well once they are placed in industrial environments, such as bioreactors or outdoor cultivation farms. As a result, cell strains that are developed in the lab often do not exhibit the same beneficial characteristic behavior when transferred to industrial production.

Microwell plates also are limited in the number of experiments that can be performed, resulting in a great deal of trial and error in finding cell strains that work sufficiently well for mass production.

The researchers demonstrated the new tool by growing colonies of algae and yeast, comparing their growth and viability against other colonies grown in water-in-oil emulsions. For the algae, the team found that PicoShell colonies accumulated biomass rapidly while algae did not grow at all in water-in-oil emulsions. Similar results were found in their yeast experiments. By selecting the top growing algae in PicoShells, the researchers could increase the production of chlorophyll biomass by 8% after only a single cycle.

The authors said PicoShells could offer a faster alternative to develop new algae and yeast strains, leading to improved biofuels, plastics, carbon-capture materials and even food products and alcoholic beverages. Further refinements to the technology, such as coating the shells with antibodies, could also lead to developing new types of protein-based medicines.

Duplaco Launches Golden-Coloured Chlorella to Discreetly Fortify Plant-Based Foods,"Dutch manufacturer Duplaco has developed a new variety of golden-coloured chlorella, making it possible to add nutrients to plant-based foods without the green colour associated with the regular variety.

Duplaco Gold is 40% protein (including all the essential amino acids), and rich in vitamins and minerals. This includes some that can be more challenging to obtain on a plant-based diet, such as iron and B12.

The product is already being used by Dutch alt-seafood startup Monkeys by the Sea in the coating of its plant-based fish nuggets. According to Duplaco, it would also be ideal for use in baked goods, pasta, and meat alternatives.

White chlorella

Duplaco Gold only has a slight colour, but the company is also working on an entirely colourless white chlorella that would be especially suitable for use in alt-dairy products.

“Our cultivation method avoids chemical treatment, which is used by other manufacturers to extract the chlorophyll from the Chlorella algae afterwards,” said Marcel Oogink, founder of Duplaco. “Duplaco Gold now allows producers to address the trend towards healthy foods without changing their taste, aroma or appearance.”

The market for algae protein

Globally, the algae protein market is expected to be worth $1.1 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 6.6%. This growth will be driven mainly by increased health awareness, along with environmental concerns.

Seaweed (a type of algae) is also seeing strong growth, with investment in the industry rising by 36% to reach $168 million in 2021. Seaweed is a highly sustainable crop as it requires no land, freshwater, or fertiliser.

“Seaweed is an important part of the earth’s ecosystem, and it has the potential to be a powerful tool to absorb carbon emissions and slow warming,” said Frances Wang, program manager of carbon dioxide removal for ClimateWorks Foundation.",,[],[]
Dichloromethane Used in Hydrothermal Liquefaction for Algae Cultivation,"In a recent study published in the journal Energy & Fuels, researchers analyzed the effect of the presence of dichloromethane solvent on the biocrude oil and solid biochar yield, and on the subsequent aqueous product recovery for microalgae cultivation in continuous hydrothermal liquefaction-based microalgae bio-refinement process.

Study: The Effect of Dichloromethane on Product Separation during Continuous Hydrothermal Liquefaction of Chlorella vulgaris and Aqueous Product Recycling for Algae Cultivation. Image Credit: Chokniti Khongchum/Shutterstock.com

The researchers processed Chlorella vulgaris microalgae in a continuously stirred tank reactor in a temperature range of 300-400 ℃ and at a pressure of 24 MPa for 15 minutes. The results suggested that 350 ℃ is the optimal temperature for the highest biocrude yield with an average increase of 9 weight %. Also, the optical density test indicated that the recovered aqueous product with activated carbon absorption purification treatment demonstrated better algae growth.

Hydrothermal Liquefaction for Bio-Refinement

Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a high-temperature and high-pressure thermo-chemical transformation process of moisture-containing micro-organisms into biofuels and other valuable products. Microalgae are a promising source for sustainable biofuel production owing to their fast growth rate, high lipid content, high photosynthetic efficiency, and high applicability to nonarable land environments.

In HTL, microalgae undergo various reactions including hydrolysis, decarboxylation, dehydration, depolymerization, and repolymerization in a temperature and pressure range of 200-380 ℃ and 5-28 MPa, respectively, using various types of reactors either in a continuous or semicontinuous process.

Four main products obtained in the HTL process are a high carbon and energy density biocrude oil, a solid biochar residue, gases such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, and an aqueous product (AP) with water-soluble organics and dissolved bio-essential micro-nutrients. The recovered biocrude can be used as a sustainable alternative for depleting fossil fuels, whereas the solid biochar and the AP could be used for subsequent algae cultivation. Also, the potentially toxic substances evolved from HTL such as pyrroles and phenols could inhibit algae growth.

Furthermore, dichloromethane (DCM) is used in continuous HTL as an organic solvent for separation of biocrude from AP owing to its higher yield/energy efficiency and lower energy consumption ratio, compared to other solvents such as toluene and acetone. However, these organic solvents transfer some of the organic elements from AP into biocrude, resulting in higher biocrude yields with undesired higher oxygen and nitrogen content, and a shortage of micro-nutrients in the AP for further algae cultivation.

About the Study

In this study, researchers used a dry powder form of microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (Cv) to prepare an algae slurry of 5 wt% in 3.2 liters of distilled water. The continuous HTL was performed in a continuous stirred tank (CST) reactor at a pressure of 24 MPa and targeted temperatures of 300, 325, 350, 375, and 400 ℃, progressively. A flow rate of 760 mL.h-1 was maintained to keep the continuous HTL process time for 15 minutes.

Subsequently, for the solvent separation method, they added 9 mL of DCM into the sample tube and agitated for 2 hours followed by careful removal of separated floating AP using a pipet. Further, the AP was pretreated using supercritical water gasification (SCWG) process and activated carbon absorption (ACA) treatment to decompose toxic byproducts into various gases, which can be removed in an eco-friendly manner during actual industry-scale production.

Finally, the obtained AP was diluted by a factor of 15 to increase the quantity and further used for algae cultivation in a 200 mL flask at a temperature of 25 ℃, a pH value of 7.3, a continuous light intensity of 125 µE/ m2s, and 5% CO 2 flow rate of 25 mL/min for 8 days.

Observations

The biocrude yield increased with an increase in temperature due to the degradation of proteins and conversion to the biocrude phase past the critical point of water and reached the maximum at 350 °C. For the non-DCM method and DCM method, it was about 38.9 ± 1.4 wt % and 47.5 ± 2.5 wt %, respectively; however, it decreased with further increase in temperature due to radical-induced cracking of biocrude and formation of lighter compounds.

The DCM solvent method showed a 9 wt % mean yield increase for all targeted temperatures, compared to that of the nonsolvent method. The general average biocrude yield estimated for CV algae at mentioned temperature range obeyed a relationship expressed by the equation: yield nonsolvent ≈ 0.818 × yield solvent . The elemental analysis revealed that the higher heating value (HHV) of the biocrude produced at different cHTL temperatures covered a range from 24.8 to 34 MJ kg−1, which was higher than that of the dry microalgae feedstock with an HHV value of 22.03 MJ kg−1.

Furthermore, the ACA treatment was able to effectively remove phenolic N-containing compounds, which have an inhibitory effect on algae growth. Additionally, the ACA treatment promoted algae growth owing to the high content of potassium and sodium after the treatment. A certain amount of these metals neutralized the organic anions and other compounds to stabilize the pH in the culture and provided a conducive environment for algae growth.

Conclusions

In this study, researchers used a continuous HTC process for Cv microalgae in a CST reactor to obtain biocrude, biochar, and AP and studied the effect of DCM organic solvent used for the separation of biocrude from the AP. Also, the AP was pretreated using the SCWG process and ACA treatment to decompose toxic byproducts that inhibited algae growth.

They found that 350 ℃ is the optimal temperature for the highest biocrude yield with an average increase of 9 wt%, and both the SCWG process and ACA treatment effectively promoted the algae growth.

Czech Foodtech Mewery Becomes “The First European” Cultivated Pork Startup Using Microalgae,"The Czech startup Mewery holds the claim of being the first European foodtech startup developing cultivated pork on a proprietary microalgae base. The Brno-based foodtech has now received backing from US accelerator Big Idea Ventures to develop cultivated pork.

With pork meat being the second most consumed meat worldwide and the most consumed and preferred meat in Europe, Russia, and China, among others, Mewery has set its sights on becoming the European cultivated pork leader. Mewery is reported to be developing its unique technology based on microalgae in order to decrease the cost of cultivation by 70%. The company aims to be entering the market by 2026 pending regulatory approval.

Developing cultivated pork using microalgae growth factors instead of fetal bovine serum is a key factor in Mewery’s strategy, becoming the first Czech company to make it into the prestigious Big Idea Ventures portfolio. Following this initial undisclosed investment, another and larger investment round is now being prepared open to other investors.

“These methods have been used in pharma for many years”

There are other players currently in the European cultivated pork sector, including Higher Steaks, a leading food technology company in the UK that revealed the world’s first cultivated bacon and pork belly. In China, the country’s first cultivated meat company Joes Future Food recently raised $10.9 million to build a pork production line.

“One really needs to understand that the process of cultivating meat in the lab is just another process by which cells grow. It’s not Frankenstein-meat, it’s not something completely strange – these methods have been used in pharma for many years”, Mewery Founder and CEO Roman Laus told Radio Prague.

“The way we get meat now through industrial farming to our table is not sustainable – it cannot survive. So this is one of the options – not the only one, but one – for how to make our world more sustainable and to also get protein to an ever-growing population.”",,[],[]
The Use of Algae to Reduce CO2 Emissions,"The high emission of greenhouse gases has been one of the foremost global threats with far-reaching consequences. Algae are photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms that are categorized as microalgae (unicellular) and macroalgae (multicellular) based on their size. Scientists have indicated that algae are extremely important to reach the global aim of zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Image Credit: Chokniti Khongchum/Shutterstock.com

Since the industrial revolution, global carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions have escalated from 9.34 billion metric tons in 1960 to 36.44 billion metric tons in 2019. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has pointed out that some of the major contributors to atmospheric carbon dioxide are electricity and heat production, agriculture, forestry, industry, and transportation.

The United Nations Environment Programme stated that to prevent global warming to reach more than 1.5 ⁰C, the world would need to lower carbon emissions by roughly 7.6% annually for the upcoming decades.

Some of the recent strategies used to reduce the level of CO 2 from the atmosphere involve bio capturing of CO 2 and bioconversion to valuable products and renewable energy.

Capturing carbon is also known as sequestration, which involves taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, decarbonizing industries, and promoting clean fossil energy production. These strategies could effectively mitigate rapid climate change and global warming.

Strategies to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emission

Algae are fast-growing aquatic organisms that are commonly found as seaweed, pond scum, and giant kelp. Scientists stated that one of the most sustainable strategies to capture and store CO 2 from the atmosphere is photosynthesis.

Several studies have indicated that microalgae have exhibited maximum carbon-fixing capabilities. These studies have shown that microalgae can capture around 100 Gt of CO 2 into biomass annually.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies have been indispensable in both fossil fuels- and biofuels-based power plants. This is because these technologies help to lower CO 2 emissions from power generation by capturing carbon during pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion. Although extensive research is being conducted to develop advanced conventional CCS technologies, public acceptance of this technology is still low.

As transportation and logistics sectors have been key contributors to CO 2 emission, scientists believe that this emission can be significantly reduced via capturing and storing of CO 2 onboard. Importantly, this system of recycling captured CO 2 is similar to conventional fuel production from renewable energy sources. In addition, it can capture 90% of the emitted CO 2 without any energy penalty.

Some of the drawbacks of the conventional CCS technologies involve high energy consumption, difficulties associated with transportation, immediate utilization of captured CO 2 , and a high possibility of leakage into the atmosphere during storage. The key advantages of microalgae-based CCS technologies are that they eliminate the above-mentioned limitation of conventional CCS technologies. Another advantage of this system is that compared to conventional CCS technologies, its operational cost is significantly low and is an eco-friendly strategy.

Microalgae and Lowering of Carbon Dioxide Emission

Blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), green algae, red algae, and diatoms are commonly referred to as microalgae. These organisms have been used for capturing carbon dioxide and sequestration.

At present, scientists have been involved in bio-capturing carbon dioxide using algae, and conversion of microalgae biomass containing CO 2 into energy (biofuel) or other value-added products. This field of science, involving carbon dioxide mitigation, bioconversion, and circular carbon economy, is fast evolving.

Microalgae-based carbon capture technology is dependent on the species of microalgae, cultivation systems, and growth conditions (e.g., temperature, culture medium, pH, salinity, turbidity, light intensity, etc.). Optimization of algal growth also impacts the concentration of CO 2 captured, for example, an increase of pH from 7.9 to 9.5 has led to a reduction of CO 2 by two orders of magnitude.

Scientists have reported that Chlorella exhibited promising CO 2 capturing capacity. This algal species can grow in an atmosphere containing 40% (v/v) CO 2 with a fixation rate of 0.77 to 2.22 g/L/day.

Oscillatoria, a freshwater alga, also possesses the capacity to reduce carbon dioxide. Some of the advantages of using this alga in integrated biorefineries include its tolerance to high temperatures, toxic gases, and the possibility to produce high-value products.

Researchers reported that at an optimal temperature of 25-30°C and pH between 7 and 9, Oscillatoria exhibited significantly higher CO 2 capture capacity. Several studies have shown Scenedesmus sp and Chlorococcum sp can be used to capture CO 2 present in effluents and those emitted from industrial activities.

Conversion of Captured CO 2 by the Microalgae

The CO 2 captured from the atmosphere by microalgae via photosynthesis is stored in its biomass. It is converted to value-added products, such as bioenergy (e.g., biogas), bio-oil, biochar, and syngas.

Although the potential of microalgae to capture carbon is significantly high, other low-value bulk products, such as proteins for food application and fatty acids for nutraceuticals, are not feasible. However, recently, researchers have developed a concept of integrated bio-refinery using a microalgae-based biological carbon-capture approach that enables enhancement in the availability of biomass feedstock as well as extraction of high value-added products.

Various high-value and low-value marketable products are obtained from integrated biorefinery systems that include biofuel, i.e., biodiesel, biogas, bioethanol, and butanol. Additionally, algal pigments, such as chlorophyll a and b, phycobilins, lutein, astaxanthin, β-carotene, and C- phycocyanin, are widely applied in dyes, cosmetics, food and feed additives, pharmaceutical and nutraceuticals. Microalgae are also considered to be a rich source of amino acids, vitamins, fatty acids, and carbohydrates.

Challenges Associated with Capturing Carbon by Microalgae

Microalgae need to be cultivated outdoor and, thereby, the varying environmental conditions influence their growth.

Most of the research and development associated with carbon capture using microalgae is still in the laboratory phase, but researchers are optimistic about developing large-scale outdoor devices for optimal algal cultivation.

More research is required to understand the CO 2 absorption process around the cell membrane of microalgae. During algal cultivation, there is a risk of contamination by certain bacterial and fungal species.

Microscopic algae are responsible for half of the global atmospheric carbon fixed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, and may be used as a sustainable bioenergy source.

The water immediately outside their cells, called the ""phycosphere,"" is rich with algal-excreted organic carbon, and is an ideal ecosystem for bacterial growth. However, detecting and measuring bacterial cell activity and population growth in the phycosphere has been difficult, because it has not been possible to track single bacteria and their locations in relation to algal cells over the course of an algal population growth cycle.

But scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and collaborators have created a new co-culture device, dubbed a ""porous microplate,"" to figure out how the phycosphere structures bacterial communities. The nanoporous copolymer allows cell metabolite exchange while blocking physical contact between adjacent culture wells.

""This design enabled the stretching out of the phycosphere in both space and time, which made it possible to quantify bacterial growth and community structure changes at different distances from the algal cells,"" said Xavier Mayali, LLNL scientist and co-author of a paper appearing in the International Society of Microbial Ecology Journal (ISME Journal).

The team showed that algal-associated bacteria grew faster when placed closer to the algal culture well, as might be expected in the real phycosphere environment.

After sequencing the algal microbiome DNA cultured in the microplate, the team revealed that certain bacteria responded to the algal production of organic carbon in a spatially dependent manner, with some bacteria adapted to living close to the algal cells and others adapted to living further away. This is analogous to buying an expensive house close to the supermarket so getting food is easier, versus buying a cheaper house further away. This concept has important implications to understanding how microbes process organic carbon in aquatic environments, which controls whether carbon is sequestered or respired back into the atmosphere as CO 2 .

An additional and unexpected result is that cultivation of the diatom Phaeodactylum in the microplate led to yields 20 times greater than batch cultures due to continuous supplementation of nutrients through the hydrogel. This finding may have a fundamental impact on efforts for increased and more efficient algal biomass production at large scales.

""The system shows that the algal phycosphere is a complex ecosystem, which allows multiple microbial groups to thrive in different locations within this microscale environment,"" Mayali said.

Other LLNL contributors include Jeffrey Kimbrel and Jessica Wollard as well as researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Growing algae outside of wastewater,"Credit: CC0 Public Domain

Growing algae in wastewater has been a hot topic in research for years. News reports for decades have touted the latest research as bringing us within reach of new sources of fertilizer or environmentally friendlier biofuel.

So far, however, these promises have not been fulfilled. One reason is that the algae grown in wastewater tends to be contaminated. But even if it wasn't, it's not clear that the applications for the algae that have been dreamed up in the lab would be the most realistic applications outside the lab.

Inside one lab, however, at the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, researchers had applications in mind when they developed a new method to use nutrients recovered from wastewater to grow algae that is more than twice as pure as algae grown directly in conventional wastewater.

The research was published online late last year in the journal Water Research.

Zhen (Jason) He, professor of energy, environmental and chemical engineering, said the problem starts with the quality of algae we currently get from wastewater.

""Gas prices may seem expensive, but it's still relatively inexpensive in the United States,"" He said. Pricewise, biofuels from algae grown in wastewater simply can't compete.

One of the reasons growing algae this way is so expensive is quality control.

Algae can grow in wastewater because of the nutrients found therein; one person's waste is another algae's food. Nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon—these byproducts of our waste are the nutrients algae need to grow.

Unsurprisingly, however, when you are trying to grow algae in wastewater, ""what you get is messy,"" He said. ""It's wastewater. Yes, you get algae. You get bacteria also. Anything will grow there. So, algae biomass grown in wastewater has low value, which reduces the overall economic profit.""

Turning the process on its head

He and his team developed a way to turn the process on its head, bringing the nutrients from the wastewater to the algae, rather than putting algae into the wastewater. The process hinges on a microbial electrochemical system developed in He's lab.

Using this system, He and his team were able to use bioelectricity to extract nutrients and then take them to the algae, feeding them more efficiently and leading to purer algal biomass.

To test its purity, He's team took wastewater from Washington University's food services; in half of the sample, they added algae. In the other half, they used He's wastewater treatment system to extract the nutrients from the wastewater, which they then used to feed algae.

Then they measured the purity of the resulting algal biomass.

The algae fed on extracted nutrients was more than 90% algae. When the algae were grown in the wastewater, the resulting biomass was just 32% algae. ""It was almost 70% bacteria,"" He said.

Being able to produce such pure algae opens the door for applications that He already knows are in demand. For instance, certain algae can synthesize secondary chemicals, some of which are used in dietary supplements—such as antioxidants—or certain pigments, or even bioactive compounds used in pharmaceuticals. Fuzhong Zhang, also a professor of energy, environmental and chemical engineering, who was a part of the research team, specializes in genetically engineering microorganisms that produce certain compounds.

Ultimately, these algae could be used to synthesize certain compounds in a biorefinery—like an oil refinery where petroleum (crude oil) is transformed into gasoline and other useful products—but without the same environmentally hazardous repercussions.

First, however, He is set on increasing the purity of the algal biomass he can produce. ""I want 95% or 98% algae,"" he said. Then he will go on to investigate what conditions are most conducive to particular algae to determine what might be the most economically viable compound to produce.

Importantly, any technology developed will be applicable not just to Washington University wastewater, but to municipal wastewater nearly anywhere in the world.

""Municipal wastewater is similar everywhere,"" He said. ""Wastewater in Europe is the same as wastewater in Los Angeles. And you want to develop something where people in other places can say, 'That can work here.'""

"""The challenge is to get the consumer to see microalgae not as a supplement, but as a regular ingredient in their diet""","A visionary, sustainability-focused project by Portugal's leading cement producer Secil, which was looking into alternatives to offset its greenhouse gas emissions, resulted 14 years ago in the creation of what would become one of the largest microalgae producing companies in Europe.



Allmicroalgae facilities.

""The Allmicroalgae project was launched in 2007 with the objective of using microalgae for the capture and mitigation of the CO₂ generated in the cement production process. In 2009, after the first crops had been grown in a trial microalgae production plant, Secil decided to go a step further and built and put into operation a 1-hectare plant that today is part of our facilities. In these 12 years, Allmicroalgae's investment has reached 15 million Euro,"" says the company.



Photobioreactors.

The cultivation of macro and microscopic algae has experienced remarkable growth in recent decades, favored by their high biomass generation capacity and photosynthetic efficiency. According to FAO's global statistics on fishery and aquaculture production (FishStatJ), this sector, which is part of the European Union's so-called blue economy, key to achieving the EU's ambitious climate and environmental objectives, grew by 6,300% between 1950 and 2019, going from 0.56 million tons to 35.82 million tons in those 69 years. Its development, even today, isn't free of challenges, although the benefits of this kind of aquaculture are substantial at multiple levels.

""As regards the food industry, microalgae are rich in protein, contain all the essential amino acids, and have a high chlorophyll content and a lipid profile, with 60% polyunsaturated fatty acids. Microalgae such as Chlorella vulgaris are also rich in vitamins, such as B12, and minerals, including iron, potassium, phosphorus and calcium.""



Yellow, green and white Chlorella vulgaris, and organic Chlorella capsules.

""Regarding environmental benefits, in addition to capturing CO₂, microalgae have the capacity to accumulate heavy metals and are known to be able to clean up 'waste' and could be a potential solution within a circular economy approach. At Allmicroalgae, various food-grade eluIds/wastes are also being tested to produce microalgae biomass without interfering with the quality and certifications we have."" Specifically, Allmicroalgae has had the EU organic certification for the production of Chlorella vulgaris since 2018, making it the only European company with large-scale organic production. Later, in 2021, it obtained the EU organic certification for the production of Spirulina, and also has the GMP + FSA, GMP and Kosher certifications.



Spirulina.

Also, microalgae can be used as biofertilizers and biostimulants in agriculture, can be the basis for animal feed and are an alternative and sustainable source of energy.

How are microalgae produced?

""As far as production systems are concerned, it is common to see new reactors and other innovations in the literature. But in our opinion, the production depends more on the biology than on the production systems themselves, mainly because Asian countries are already successfully producing large quantities and the technology already exists. When it comes to processing techniques, the reality is different. This is an area that is still under development.""



Raceway.

""Our production process for industrial microalgae species is unique, very flexible and very demanding in terms of quality assurance. The strains are kept in the most suitable conditions for cell division, and when they reach high concentrations, they are transferred to a larger volume with more space to allow them continue growing,"" says the Portuguese company based in Pataias. ""Chlorella microalgae can grow autotrophically or heterotrophically. At Allmicroalgae, green Chlorella vulgaris is produced biphasically. Initially, the inoculum is produced by fermentation and later in photobioreactors (under outdoor conditions). In addition to green Chlorella vulgaris, Allmicroalgaae also produces yellow and white Chlorella vulgaris. These products are very attractive, as the final product's organoleptic characteristics (color, taste and sensory profile) are improved.""



Allmicroalgae photobioreactors.

""Allmicroalgae also produces Spirulina and markets it naturally dehydrated in the form of paste or powder.""

A growing industry in Europe and America

These high value added products can have different applications, according to Allmicroalgae. ""They can be taken as a daily supplement in capsules or used directly in smoothies, soups, bakery products, etc. Our microalgae are marketed in the B2C market under our Allma brand and in the B2B market, both in Portugal and in some export markets.""



Allmicroalgae microalgae products.

The microalgae market already has a long history in Asia, but in Europe and America it only started 2 decades ago. And the data published in FishStatJ confirm it. According to FAO statistics for 2019, Asia - with China at the head - produces 97.2% of the microalgae cultivated globally. ""However, this industry is growing everywhere,"" says Allmicroalgae, ""and the biggest growth is being recorded in the regions with the greatest momentum right now: Europe and America.""

""In fact, we expect this growth to continue and microalgae to become more present in various gastronomies. Europe and America have just started to produce microalgae and key players in the food industry are increasingly interested in this sector, given the different applications it could have in their current portfolio. Another relevant issue is the vegan trend, which is leading consumers to look for plant-based protein sources, and microalgae can become a very good alternative, given their nutritional profile.""



Allmicroalgae's microalgae products.

But there are still challenges for the industry, and one of the biggest is scaling up the production while guaranteeing a similar nutritional profile in every batch, they say. ""For the consumers, the biggest challenge will be to introduce microalgae in the regular diet, so that people won't consume them only as detox products, in weight loss diets or as purely healthy foods. The industry, with its R&D teams, is trying to find different applications with which to include microalgae in food so that price, taste or convenience won't be an issue. The challenge is to make consumers see microalgae not as a supplement, but as a regular ingredient,"" says Allmicroalgae.

Portugal, one of the pioneers in the microalgae market

Microalgae are a key component of the marine environment. Approximately 80% of the algae species in the oceans belong to this category, whose industry, as highlighted by the European Union, will help achieve the objectives of the European Green Pact. And companies like Allmicroalgae are actively involved in the transition to a sustainable blue economy on the continent.

""At AllMicroalgae, we are already expanding our production site to be able to meet our targets, and future expansions will depend on the demand. We conduct trials every year with different species because we are still in the early stages of microalgae production, so it is extremely important to focus and invest in research and development. There is still plenty of market potential.""

""Portugal has a huge coastline, and it is part of the Portuguese DNA to be close to the sea and to try finding new ways. The macroalgae industry has already been developing for a long time, so given the good weather conditions that the country has, it was only a matter of time before microalgae attracted the attention of some entrepreneur.""

Speaking Algae: Tapping the Ancient Power of Microalgae Using Synthetic Biology,"Albert Einstein famously said, “the only source of knowledge is experience.”



What if we take this principle to an extreme—say, millions or even billions of years of experience living on Earth? What knowledge might be available?



We don’t need to guess. We can look to microalgae, some of the oldest and “most experienced” organisms on our planet.



But, this begs the question, how do humans tap into microalgae’s “life experience” to acquire valuable knowledge? To do so, we must learn to speak their “language” and translate that information into useful applications for society and its industries. Amazingly, recent strides in microalgae biotechnology, synthetic biology, and biomanufacturing are making that possible.

During their time on the planet, microalgae have been busy. Given hundreds of millions of years of experimentation, microalgae evolved the genetic and biochemical skill sets needed to survive and colonize nearly every type of ecosystem on Earth, including some of the most inhospitable, 1 like the highly saline environment of the Dead Sea. 2 The continuous evolution needed to master the planet’s many ecosystems drove the creation of an impressive diversity of microalgae species, with conservative estimates landing around 70,000 3 species and others reaching 200,000 to several million.Through natural selection, each species became fine-tuned to their specific light conditions and available resources. Each species also ultimately developed unique natural product profiles and metabolic characteristics, turning light and CO2 into specific organic materials needed for their survival.While microalgae have been used in food and nutrition worldwide for centuries,it wasn’t until the middle of the 20th century that scientists began exploring the application of microalgae in biotechnology. Researchers realized that microalgae could be used as a sustainable, photosynthesis-powered expression chassis.The first successful example occurred in the 1980s when commercial groups culturedto produce β-carotene,a nutraceutical supplement that the body converts to vitamin A. We now know that microalgae species can produce a variety of high-value materials, like pigments, flavors, fragrances, growth factors, fatty acids, antioxidants, oligosaccharides, proteins, terpenes, amino acids, peptides, and many more materials desired by key industries. Until recently, the vast majority of algae biotechnology attention and funding focused on biofuel production, with limited commercial success. 7 By the 2000s and early 2010s, biofuel researchers were captivated by microalgae’s ability to produce biomass enriched with a diverse collection of high energy molecules, such as long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.However, specific technological challenges precluded commercial success. Biofuel producers struggled to increase microalgae cultivation to commercial scales while maintaining rapid growth rates, photosynthetic efficiency, ideal metabolic profiles, and algae stability. 9 While exploring untapped microalgae diversity to find a more fit-to-purpose expression chassis could resolve some of these challenges, the data mining, characterization, selection, and development of new species was often too time and labor-intensive. As a result, biofuel producers largely focused on a small subset of known microalgae species, which narrowed the collective vision of microalgae applications.Furthermore, microalgae cultivated in large-scale, open-air pond systems were prone to contamination and inconsistent production. Unfortunately, more tightly-controlled production processes using photo-bioreactors were also not viable at that time, particularly when it came to their light source. 9 While microalgae biofuels still have potential, these challenges indicate that it is time to consider microalgae as an expression chassis for a wider range of materials, particularly those required at smaller scales than biofuels. Propelled by findings from biofuel research, organizations are now realizing the rich opportunities of using microalgae to produce high value low volume products. 10 Discoveries of commercial relevance will grow exponentially as more microalgae species are characterized, since only a small number (~15) are grown at meaningful commercial scales today.In just the past few years, advanced synthetic biology approaches have made the discovery and mapping of microalgae species and their industry- and molecule-specific potential much more efficient and purpose-driven.In addition to improved recombinant gene transfer and genome editing techniques, 12 the exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have made large dataset management and analysis much faster and less labor-intensive.In turn, this enables better metabolic profile modeling, providing more accurate predictions of each species’ ability to produce a specific material. Now, individuals seeking biomanufactured alternatives to specific chemically synthesized materials can more readily seek out a species naturally primed to produce it or a related precursor.These advancements have also enabled better characterization of these species and their specific cultivation requirements. Thus, researchers can more quickly identify the optimal conditions that enable specific microalgae to grow rapidly and produce their target molecules.Tapping into the bioproduction capabilities of microalgae species also requires new advanced manufacturing technology to solve microalgae’s historic scale-up challenges.Most importantly, the past decade of algae research has cemented that light conditions massively impact algae growth, gene expression, and biomaterial production on a species-specific basis. Light is the primary medium by which microalgae interact with their environment. So, to tap into the natural diversity of microalgae, we must speak algae using light as our language.All microalgae maintain intricate light-sensing systems, made up of a network of photoreceptors and associated signaling pathways. 14 These photoreceptors control different biological functions and regulate specific gene expression to help algae respond to changing environmental conditions. Having evolved in very different ecosystems, these photosystems vary significantly between species, as do their photoreceptors and thefunctions they control. 15 Thus, biomanufacturers must understand how this complex network of photoreceptors functions for each species. With the ability to carefully tune photosynthesis, biomanufacturers can control microalgae growth, development, and biomaterial expression to suit their needs. Importantly, AI and synthetic biology approaches also help researchers determine and augment both ideal light conditions as well as conditions that impact the production of valuable organic materials and recombinant gene expression across species.To make use of algae's special relationship with light, biomanufacturers needed photo-bioreactors capable of providing high-intensity light across a variety of specific wavelengths and illumination periods. Up until a few years ago, this was virtually impossible at commercial scales. However, recent advances in LED technology now enable more advanced photo-bioreactor approaches, 16 solving their past challenges. While once restricted to specific wavelengths, LEDs can now produce light across a much wider spectrum.Additionally, LEDs are now also much more efficient, smaller, and cheaper, 18 which drastically increases their commercial viability in bioreactors. Together, these LED advancements make it possible to construct ideal light conditions for specific algae species without limitations regarding photo-bioreactor design and operation expenses.While improved lighting is the most important technological advancement, sufficiently protecting the fragile structures of microalgae remained another persistent scale-up challenge. 19 New bioreactor approaches and culture strategies have also helped to increase microalgae stability during biomanufacturing. Furthermore, the advancement of computational fluid dynamics has increased our ability to predict and understand light penetration in water, gas transfer efficiency, and fluid flow to better protect fragile algae species which historically have been difficult to grow. 20 In combination with LED advancements, this means commercially viable photo-bioreactors are now possible and available, opening up greater scale opportunities.The massive untapped diversity of microalgae species represents an outstanding opportunity to produce important materials by building on evolutionary experience. Though relatively few microalgae species have been fully explored and characterized, several efforts are underway to bring more species online. Having a greater understanding of these species is already yielding dividends, especially when paired with end-to-end biomanufacturing approaches.The microalgae biotechnology community has learned from the challenges of the past and is now ready to make microalgae bioproduction commonplace across many industries, including pharma, biopharma, animal health, agriculture, food and beverage, energy, and beyond. Despite having only a measly 200,000 years under our belt, human experience has its merits too. With this cumulative knowledge, the future of microalgae is at least LED-bright.

Australian microalgae manufacturer secures $11.4 million from Hitachi Ventures,"Provectus Algae (Provectus), an Australian synthetic biology and biomanufacturing company, has raised $11.4 million in a pre-series A funding round. The funding comes from Hitachi Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of Hitachi, and Vectr Ventures of Hong Kong.

Provectus Algae will use the finance to develop their biomanufacturing platform, support R&D for early-stage product development, increase commercial production capacity, and commercialise market-ready products.

The company develops, scales, and markets bio-based products for a range of applications in agriculture, food and beverage, and medicine. Their end-to-end system improves ensures rapid development and commercialisation of new algae-based product ideas. Many products are already in the pipeline, including recombinant proteins developed by Provectus. It has also secured a commercial agreement with a global good and beverage ingredients supplier.

Their biomanufacturing system deploys sophisticated technology for scaled microalgae cultivation. Their Precision Photosynthesis photobioreactor controls lighting conditions around the microalgae culture, offering a better growing technique than raceway ponds in places where sunlight is intermittent. Computational modelling also helps scale the production of compounds economically by optimising growth conditions.

“We are excited to have Hitachi Ventures join this round, their mandate has high alignment with our vision for Provectus and we look forward to developing a close working relationship with the Hitachi team to expedite the scale of our technology during this next phase of growth and beyond,” said Nusqe Spanton, CEO. “To have the Vectr Ventures team step up again and co-Lead this round alongside Hitachi Ventures means a lot to our team. The support they have provided to date has been invaluable and we are pleased to have their continued backing.”

Hitachi Ventures has been targeting early-stage companies working on environmental and social solutions through decarbonising technologies. They established a second fund dedicated to this earlier in 2021. Provectus has been its first cornerstone beneficiary.

“Provectus perfectly fits the profile of innovative, early-stage companies that we envisioned when we created Hitachi Ventures’ second fund,” said Pete Bastien, Partner at Hitachi Ventures. “Through this investment and more to come, Hitachi is working to solve the global environmental and social issues in collaboration with like-minded, visionary entrepreneurs. Together, we are working towards the realization of a decarbonized, sustainable society.”",,[],[]
Making cultivated meat ‘bleed’ with red algae: ‘Even cell-based meat looks pale; it will need our solution’,"The marine ingredient start-up has coined its red microalgae extract Ounje, meaning ‘food’ in the Yoruba language spoken in West Africa.

The ‘clean label’ formulation (appearing as ‘red algae extract’ on ingredients lists) mimics the red juices of real meat, without the need for artificial colour additives.

Algae discovery​

The product was discovered when Yemoja combined the new marine ingredient with other derivatives from the same Porphyridium ​strain of algae.

“While working on a new formulation for cosmetics applications, we serendipitously discovered that this specific composition yields a substance that resembled blood in appearance and texture,” ​recalled Amikam Bar-Gil, co-founder and CTO of Yemoja.

“Encouraged by the first test results, we decided to push the boundaries further and take it to the next level, trying it out in test products. The results were an immediate proof of concept.” ​

Yemoja also uses its ‘super intensive’ growing platform to standardise microalgae bio compounds for the nutraceutical and cosmetics B2B sectors. The platform system allows the manipulation of light, temperature, and pH to yield high concentrations of desired bioactive compounds with minimal ecologic footprint and without contaminants. The closed cultivation system allows for multiple species to be grown simultaneously.

Plant-based heme substitute​

The start-up claims its deep red algae-based product has the potential to serve as a 100% plant-sourced heme substitute for the cultured meat and plant-based meat analogue sectors.

“When it comes to creating plant-based meats and hybrids, there is a strong demand for a convincing blood substitute to award the growing pool of ethically conscious diners the full experience of biting into a juicy beef burger,” ​noted the firm.

However, current offerings are largely made from beetroot juice or other colour additives, which Yemoja said are suitable in the products’ raw stage – but ‘still cannot’ change colour the way meat does when cooked. “This often necessitates adding various sugars that caramelize when heated to attain the desired effect.”​

The patented microalgal heme substitute also congeals like real meat juices. “We found the polysaccharides within this particular algae species express a viscosity similar to gelatin when cooked. Its natural fibre also awards an appealing crunchiness and emits an appetising meaty aroma,” ​said Bar-Gil.

In being suitable to both cultured meat and plant-based products, Ounje is tasteless, the CTO told this publication. “One of our potential customers, whom we teamed up with for testing, said that he found it actually strengthened the tastes and seasonings of the final product.” ​

Focus on cell-based​

While simultaneously targeting the plant-based meat market, Yemoji sees strong potential for Ounji within the cultivated meat sector.

As Bar-Gil explained, ‘even cell-based meat looks pale’. “Because [cultivated meat makers] will probably not use real blood in their products (otherwise it would not be considered vegan), they will need our solution.” ​

The company produces its algae heme substitute via a cold process in its GMP-certified facility without using any organic solvents. “We believe our algae can imbue cultured meat cells with a nutrient-rich media to feed on,” ​said Bar-Gil.

“We are currently assessing its potential to act as a suitable biomaterial scaffold on which the cells can grow. This structure will allow it to mimic the behaviour of meat, especially when it hits the skillet.” ​The ingredient can make up 10% of the final product, he added.

Within either plant-based or cell-based matrices, the algae add a nutrient boost. Microalgae contains 20-30% protein and boasts a complete amino acid profile. Algae are also a source of essential fatty acids, polyphenols, as well as minerals and vitamins.

Next steps​

Yemoja is currently piloting its microalgae ingredient with one plant-based start-up and another cultured meat producer, and reports ‘promising’ results.

However, as the heme alternative is considered a novel food, it is not yet approved for commercialisation. “Although it is completely natural and made from microalgae, this specific strain is not yet approved for human consumption,” ​Bar-Gil explained. “Regulation procedures are already underway, and we expect to finalise regulatory approval by the end of the development.” ​

Yemoja is planning for a global roll-out, revealing the product will be available within 18 months or ‘sooner’. “This largely depends on how soon our clients will want to roll out their algae-infused alternative meat products and how soon we gain GRAS approval.” ​",,[],['Flora Southey']
Hydroponic Farming: Microalgae Could Be An Added Advantage For Your Hydroponic System,"Several studies have suggested the ecological and environmental benefits of Microalgae. Have You ever heard of using Microalgae in Hydroponic System? If not keep reading the article to know its use and benefits in Hydroponics.

Hydroponic systems are effective vegetable production techniques in which plants grow 30-50 percent quicker than in soil. Microalgae thrive in hydroponic systems, particularly those with a re-circulating nutrient solution, due to the abundance of nutrients, heat, and light.

Microalgae have an impact on water quality characteristics such as pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrient intake in water, and can compete with the target vegetable. Microalgae can even function as buffers, preventing chemical disinfection from being effective. As a result, they are often regarded as a ""weed"" in hydroponic systems, and significant efforts are undertaken to reduce algal populations in hydroponic systems.

Microalgae can be favorable to plant growth

Microalgae, on the other hand, can be favorable to plant growth. The oxygen generated by microalgae photosynthesis inhibits anaerobiosis in plant root systems, hence protecting plant roots. Microalgae release a variety of chemicals (including phytohormones and protein hydrolysates) that can function as plant growth promoters and biofertilizers, particularly during the early phases of plant growth, germination, and root formation. The addition of microalgae can boost the rate of removal of dissolved solids, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus from hydroponic wastewater significantly.

Some studies have also indicated that using living microalgae in the nutrient solution might minimize the need for mineral fertilizers in hydroponic production while increasing the qualitative attributes of the crops, such as total soluble solids (Brix) and vitamin C. With the co-cultivation of microalgae, hydroponic vegetable production might be transformed to an ecologically friendly and economically viable production method.

Water2REturn project

Microalgae and residual water after harvesting microalgae were examined in hydroponic farming of lettuce and tomatoes at the University of Ljubljana as part of the Water2REturn project. The microalgae flourished in the hydroponic systems, and the crops grew well in all treatments, with or without microalgae. There was no statistical difference in the fresh weight of the lettuce heads at the end of the experiment, but the introduction of treated - autoclaved - microalgae and the use of leftover water after harvesting had a substantial favorable effect on the growth of the lettuce roots.

In the tomato experiment, the control treatment used 50% more mineral fertilizer than the addition of microalgae residual water (supernatant), yet tomato output remained equivalent, demonstrating that algae increased the nutrient utilization of the hydroponic system. The introduction of microalgae or supernatant (residual) water to the hydroponic system dramatically boosted root system growth.",,[],[]
China: Geb Impact Technology Joins Dao Foods Incubator & Receives Government Grant For Microalgae Cultivation,"Geb Impact Technology Company Limited, a Hong Kong biotechnology company cultivating selected microalgae, has received a grant from the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) under the Enterprise Support Scheme (ESS) for a project entitled “All-in-One Euglena by Advanced Fermentation as Main Plant-based Replacement of Meat” with a project budget of $2 million HKD.

Following years of research, the company chose to cultivate Euglena microalgae because it combines the benefits of protein, beta-glucan, EPA, and DHA, making it an all-in-one solution to human nutrition needs and a promising ingredient for plant-based meat, seafood, and other alternative protein products.

Geb Impact has successfully achieved the production of axenic Euglena dry biomass with protein content over 50% by weight in their R&D facility, while also demonstrated a high productivity gain of 55g/L in biomass production, with no contamination. Euglena is a natural dietary fiber (polysaccharide), which can activate immune cells and enhance the body’s ability to resist viral and bacterial infections. It is not genetically modified and does not contain any major allergens.

“Dao Foods believes that microalgae and other microbial fermentation technologies will play a significant role in providing consumers with exciting food choices that are significantly more sustainable than traditional animal protein sources. As such, we are excited to work with the Geb Impact Technology team to help them further develop their microalgae cultivation and extend their product reach in China, where we believe the demand for alternative proteins will increase dramatically in coming years,” said Albert Tseng, Co-Founder of Dao Foods.

Geb Impact was founded by two experienced founders with years of experience in Silicon Valley. They are now applying their experience in precision engineering, manufacturing technology and marketing to the production of microalgae. James Chang with a degree in Numerical Analysis and an MBA has garnered decades of experience in global marketing and promotion of innovative products in the semiconductor industry. As CEO, James will actively deploy his technical skills and know-how in guiding the product and market development of the company.

Dr. Wang Zhonghui (Alex), who worked in Silicon Valley for 15 years is the CTO of Geb Impact Technology and holds a PhD in materials technology and chemical engineering as well as an MBA degree. Both founders are passionate about sustainable development and believe that microalgae can provide consumers healthier and more environmentally friendly products that improve food security and human wellbeing.",,[],[]
Protein made from microalgae fed with food waste comes to Europe,"Sophie’s BioNutrients is developing a range of microalgae-based protein flours for plant-based meat and alt dairy categories.

Aside from being high in protein, microalgae are a source of carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fatty acids, iron and B vitamins.

However, at this year’s Food Ingredients Europe (FiE) event in Frankfurt, Sophie’s BioNutrients CEO and co-founder Eugene Wang did not play up its health benefits. “We all know microalgae is nutritious,” ​he told delegates.

Rather, the start-up is setting itself apart in terms of sustainability and functionality: it embraces the circular economy and according to Wang, its first protein powder product is ‘good enough for any kind of plant-based dairy application’.

Protein with ‘wonderful colour and flavour’​

Sophie’s BioNutrients was established in 2017 by co-founders Wang and CTO Kirin Tsuei, after Wang learnt of his daughter Sophie’s allergy to shellfish. Their mission was to create a high-quality, nutritious, and importantly, non-allergenic, protein alternative.

Observing the meat-free trend, the founders noted it was being dominated by plant-based alternatives. Wang takes issue with many of these products, stressing some are allergenic, lacking in nutrients and variety, challenging to scale and expensive.

“The question is: Is the plant-based protein we’re promoting to the world really the silver bullet we’re looking for? We do not think so.”​

Sophie’s BioNutrients’ solution lies in microalgae, which it ferments in bioreactors before isolating its proteins and transforming it into a powder for food formulation.

To kickstart production, the team underwent a thorough strain selection process. “We’ve been through, by now, over 1,200 different species of microalgae,” ​said Wang. “We finally found about four strains that we can grow, in the dark, in fermentation…that are sturdy enough to be fed with all kinds of industrial waste.” ​

The CEO continued: “After our protein isolation process, it has a wonderful colour, a wonderful flavour…a protein flour that in the future can be priced competitively.”​

Circular economy​

An undoubtedly attractive quality of microalgae for Sophie’s BioNutrients is its sustainability profile compared to animal- or even some plant-based alternatives.

At FiE, Wang described the production process as ‘maximum protein with minimum footprint’.

“The beauty of [leveraging] fermentation, is that everything is a lot less,” ​he explained, comparing land-use, time, water, and energy-use with animal protein production, as well as pea and soy, on a per-unit basis. Indeed, its microalgae-based protein powder can be produced in just three days, and producing one ton uses just 0.02 hectares of space.

“But more importantly, with fermentation, you don’t have …harmful herbicides, fertilisers, antibiotics or hormones.” ​

The other strong sustainability angle is Sophie BioNutrients’ commitment to the circular economy. The start-up is feeding its microalgae strains with side streams from the food and beverage industry.

Three primary side streams are being upcycled for this purpose: brewer’s spent grains, okara (soybean pulp), and molasses from sugar refineries.

Partaking in the circular economy also yields financial benefits, the CEO explained. “It turns out it’s a wonderful idea, not only does it create a circular economy, but it also helps reduce our production costs.”​

Commercialisation strategy​

Sophie’s BioNutrients is targeting manufacturers of plant-based meat and dairy alternatives with a range of protein flours.

Founded in Singapore, the start-up is making plans to move ‘a lot’ of its operations to Europe, revealed the CEO: “My guys are planning to relocate from Singapore to Amsterdam at the moment.”​

Wang continued: “Quite frankly, we see the future of alternative protein, especially microalgae protein, right here in Europe.​

“So we want to make Europe our main customer base for the sale of our protein flour.”​

The start-up achieved its first Proof of Concept (POC) in a 10L bioreactor in 2018. Last year, it successfully upscaled to 10,000L.

It expects its first protein flour, which can be used for solubility, viscosity and foaming in milk, cheese and protein drink products, to reach the market in 2021-22. Its second protein flour has a similar timeline but has emulsification properties for meat alternatives.

Sophie BioNutrients plans to market at least another three protein flour products within the next three years.

Wang said he was convinced of the market opportunity within the protein alternatives space. “The market opportunity is very real,” ​he told delegates.

According to a 2021 study by BCG and Blue Horizon Corporation, the market for alternative meat, eggs, dairy, and seafood products is set to reach at least $290m by 2035.

However, even more relevant for Sophie’s BioNutrients, the same study predicts alternative proteins made from microorganisms like fungi, yeasts, and single-celled algae to reach taste, texture and price parity with conventional animal proteins by 2025.

“[The research] basically says that by the year 2035, people are going to consume a lot of tonnage of microorganism-based protein. And that translates into a huge among of dollars that in the future we can go after,” ​said Wang.",,[],['Flora Southey']
Cyanotech Stock: The ESG Future Of Food Protein Production (NASDAQ:CYAN),"pilipphoto/iStock via Getty Images

My momentum trading formulas have discovered an interesting upturn in the business fortunes of Cyanotech (NASDAQ:CYAN), one of the leading microalgae growers for health foods and supplements in the world (including pill bottling unit Nutrex Hawaii). The company is U.S. FDA reviewed and has one of the more innovative, patented designs for growing astaxanthin and spirulina completely in-house at one location in Hawaii.

The company is quite small, but there’s plenty to get excited about. Having perhaps the longest roots in successful aquaculture in the U.S., Cyanotech’s co-founder and CEO Gerald Cysewski has positioned the organization for a path to faster growth in the coming years. And, outside/independent Chairman Michael Davis has become a big believer, continually upping his ownership over the years to roughly 20% of common shares outstanding today (vs. 2% for the CEO).

CYAN’s upfront valuation in early 2022 is nearly the lowest in a decade, with the share price trading below tangible book value and at bargain extremes on other basic fundamental ratios. The bullish thesis is rising sales and income trends have gone largely unnoticed by Wall Street over the last six months. With the odds favoring major demand growth for the algae farming industry over the next decade and Cyanotech likely increasing its market share over the next couple of years with intelligent decision-making and extensive operating experience, why not dig deeper into the investment proposition.

Using Q3 sales results ending in December and calendar 2021 margins as a proxy for four quarters, the company is now selling for less than 0.5x annualized sales, 6x earnings per share, and 5x free cash flow (adjusting for the initial increase in inventory and accounts receivable to service rising sales) on a forward estimated basis. Here’s why I view the current $3.12 stock quote as an interesting buy opportunity for long-term investors.

The Business

You may have heard of or used its retail Nutrex-Hawaii brand BioAstin Hawaiian Astaxanthin dry powder or pill supplements, a powerful dietary antioxidant shown to support and maintain the body's natural inflammatory response, to enhance skin, and to support eye, joint and immune health. It has expanding applications as a human dietary supplement and ingredient. A second product is Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica, a nutrient-rich dietary supplement used for extra energy, a strengthened immune system, cardiovascular benefits and as a source of antioxidant carotenoids.

Cyanotech Website Cyanotech Website Cyanotech Website Nutrex-Hawaii Website Cyanotech Website Cyanotech Website

The company’s website does a better job of explaining exactly how they mass produce microalgae for human (and potentially animal) consumption:

Our production of these products at the 96-acre facility on the Kailua-Kona Coast of the island of Hawaii provides several benefits. We selected the Keahole Point location in order to take advantage of relatively consistent warm temperatures, sunshine and low levels of rainfall needed for optimal cultivation of microalgae. This location also offers us access to cold deep ocean water, drawn from an offshore depth of 2,000 feet, which we use in our Ocean-Chill Drying system to eliminate the oxidative damage caused by standard drying techniques and as a source of trace nutrients for microalgal cultures. The area is also designated a Biosecure Zone, with tight control of organisms allowed into the area and free of genetically modified organisms (GMO’s). We believe that our technology, systems, processes and favorable growing location generally permit year-round harvest of our microalgal products in a cost-effective manner. Microalgae are a diverse group of microscopic plants that have a wide range of physiological and biochemical characteristics and contain, among other things, high levels of natural protein, amino acids, vitamins, pigments and enzymes. Microalgae have the following properties that make commercial production attractive: (1) microalgae grow much faster than land grown plants, often up to 100 times faster; (2) microalgae have uniform cell structures with no bark, stems, branches or leaves, permitting easier extraction of products and higher utilization of the microalgae cells; and (3) the cellular uniformity of microalgae makes it practical to control the growing environment in order to optimize a particular cell characteristic. Efficient and effective cultivation of microalgae requires consistent light, warm temperatures, low rainfall and proper chemical balance in a very nutrient-rich environment, free of environmental contaminants and unwanted organisms. This is a challenge that has motivated us to design, develop and implement proprietary production and harvesting technologies, systems and processes in order to commercially produce human nutritional products derived from microalgae.

The Bright Future for Aquaculture Algae as Climate-Change Concerns Escalate

With the growing popularity/focus by consumers on plant-based meat substitutes, vegan diets, and healthier eating habits, prospects for Cyanotech's business long term are quite bright. And while I cannot guarantee a big jump in demand for algae-based food items is at hand, the siren call urgency worldwide to slow climate-change gas emissions could be a blockbuster opportunity in the years ahead for those already established in the aquaculture field.

You may have heard of the methane problem (a far more potent greenhouse emission issue than carbon dioxide) being created by ever larger herds of cows on the planet. The University of California, Davis and others have been studying ways to shrink methane gas emissions in livestock for years, suggesting the addition of 1% or less in a specific red algae to cow diets could sharply reduce methane belched and farted from our favorite protein consumption item – the leading red meat and milk source for mankind on planet earth.

According to researchers, a staggering 14.5% of all greenhouse emissions come from livestock generally on the planet. What if simply changing livestock diets with government mandated sea-based additives could help save the planet? Cutting the amount of methane gas cows expel won’t take much algae. Researchers at Penn State University found that replacing 0.5% of cattle’s feed with an Asparagopsis taxiformis supplement could reduce up to 80% of emissions.

Source: GLEAM – Via UCDavis Clear Center Newsletter June 2020

Although Cyanotech is not involved in seaweed algae production for animals today, it is definitely something that could be added into the operating business mix. Specifically, Asparagopsis taxiformis is a red seaweed (algae) grown by nature in temperate waters, in parts of Asia, Australia, plus a few places the U.S. including Southern California, the Florida Keys, and Hawaii. The climate-saving idea is land-based aquaculture can scale up production of this red algae in ponds, so it can be sustainably and profitably sold to farmers/ranchers worldwide.

While the company’s present algae species could be other smart substitutes to consider feeding cattle and livestock (with further research effort), they are already a great form of protein consumption competition to red meat and milk.

One way Cyanotech can help the environment immediately is by selling its protein-laden products directly to health food manufacturers as a wholesale ingredient and dietary supplement. Company grown and dried algae could be used as a source of protein in popular plant-based meat substitutes, for example, cutting demand for meat. And, such a change in demand dynamics may have started in calendar 2021. Unusual company revenue gains the last two quarters are largely a function of a big jump in “bulk” sales to third parties. The good news for shareholders is a decent +21% rise in total sales during the last nine months of 2021 has supported the best operating income since 2013.

Rapidly Improving Financials

The primary support for shares reversing out of a downtrend early in 2022 into a rising price (lower overhead supply) backdrop appears to be the solid Q3 results for December reported in February. The company was experiencing steady, albeit slower growth early in 2021, but sales of “bulk” algae to third parties exploded higher between October and December. I have this revenue data surge boxed in red below.

10-Q December 2021 Q3 10-Q December 2021 Q3

The incremental increase in sales has also pushed gross margins (boxed in blue below) and net operating income (boxed in green) dramatically higher. For the 9-month period measured from March, operating income margins move to roughly 8% from an almost flat showing last year.

10-Q December 2021 Q3

Extrapolating the Q3 numbers into a full year, I come up with a $40+ million revenue estimate for fiscal 2023 starting in April, alongside the potential for $3+ million in net after-tax profits and between $3.5 and $4 million in free cash flow. To build a higher sales rate, Cyanotech has initially expanded its inventory holdings, while foregone some immediate cash flow to allow higher accounts receivable. Both are boxed in red below.

10-Q December 2021 Q3

Reviewing other information in the December 10-Q filing, it looks like two customers are accounting for the solid uptick in bulk sales and accounts receivable. An extra $2.5 million in cash flow was initially absorbed in late 2021 to support the higher accounts receivable level. Using a $10 million quarterly sales assumption going forward, cash flow of $5 million annually and free cash flow of $4 million are entirely possible.

10-Q December 2021 Q3

Again, the reason for my optimism vs. past false starts and zigzags in sales for the company is bulk sales as a wholesale item continue to ramp. Over the next year, wholesale ingredient sales may overtake sales of in-house bottled product. Representing a minor 11% of total revenue in fiscal 2019, bulk sales in the December quarter reached 42% of the topline. In addition, sales outside of the United States have been on a steady upward trajectory for years. Assuming both trends continue, revenue and income growth could be quite stellar in calendar 2022-23.

Ultra-Low Valuation

On the risk-control front for new buyers of the stock, a lagging price for years means the current valuation of the business is absurdly low. Below is a 5-year total return performance comparison vs. the best peer group I can come up with. Truthfully, Cyanotech runs a unique business model, with few if any direct comps. The group includes Corbion (OTCPK:CSNVF), Mannatech (MTEX), LifeVantage (LFVN), ZIVO Bioscience (ZIVO), Nature's Sunshine (NATR), and Medifast (MED). I have also included the small-cap index iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) to compare performance stats, the most correlated index for CYAN's market capitalization size.

YCharts

When we combine rising business growth with a stock quote lower than many years ago, you get an interesting valuation worthy of consideration for your portfolio. Below is a 10-year graph of price to trailing sales, cash flow, and book value. Notice, Cyanotech is nearing its cheapest setup in a decade, trading just above the pandemic selling lows of early 2020 on its basic fundamental ratios.

YCharts

It’s also quite cheap vs. the peer group on the same metrics today, pictured below on 5-year graphs. My read of the situation is Cyanotech is quickly becoming a hidden gem on Wall Street, especially if sales, cash flow and book value continue to expand nicely in 2022-23.

YCharts YCharts YCharts

Including limited debt/leverage at Cyanotech, the enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization calculation is extremely inexpensive, especially if business fortunes are turning up. CYAN’s EV to EBITDA number of 5x is far away from the equivalent S&P 500 ratio around 16x. In reality, the whole natural food, health supplement, and vitamin group looks to be rather cheap today. I mentioned Mannatech in a bullish article during January here.

YCharts

Perhaps the strongest buy argument in CYAN shares outside of a low valuation is business sales, cash flow and profitability (including margins) are trending in the right direction into calendar 2022. Below are charts of growth in all the important operating business metrics, each moving to multi-year highs.

Trading Chart

One of my favorite proprietary momentum screens has been highlighting the company as a terrific buy candidate all week. It looks at 12 different momentum indicators, searching for a lack of overhead share supply, on top of a clear reversal in trading trends.

Some of the positive developments since February are drawn on the 9-month chart below. Despite the bearish action on Wall Street generally in early 2022, CYAN’s price has recaptured both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Price has outperformed the S&P 500 index by +8.4% over this span, and the Russell 2000 index by +15% (not pictured).

The Negative Volume Index (marked with a red arrow) has been performing far better of late vs. the middle of 2021. Plus, On Balance Volume has been quite positive throughout the whole period. The two indicators are telling us regular buying interest has existed on both low and high-volume trading sessions.

My formula rates the technical momentum backdrop, by itself, as a Strong Buy idea vs. thousands of U.S. equities. That’s before digging deeper into the fundamental story and increasing odds of material growth in the business.

StockCharts.com

Final Thoughts

Considering the present $19 million equity market capitalization, with limited debts/lease obligations around $7 million ($500,000 in trailing annual interest expense) and working capital of $11 million, the stock quote is nowhere close to what I would call a fair value calculation, if sales, cash flow, and income climb even faster in 2022-23. Given a conservative forecast of 10% annual revenue growth in the next few years and margins similar to calendar 2021, a market cap of $30-40 million seems more appropriate using historical fundamental ratio averages in CYAN, equal to a stock quote range of $5 to $7.

Cyanotech may represent a potential high-reward, below-normal risk investment in the stock market around $3 per share, selling for tangible book value. It may be the best-positioned standalone algae growing concern available to retail investors. The company has the expertise and experience to continue ramping its operations if demand expands in the next year. Plus, if management deems the idea an income generating winner, Cyanotech could enter the seaweed algae growing business to source additives for livestock farmers/ranchers.

What’s the downside? That’s a reasonable question. If the stock were selling for $10 a share, I would not be interested honestly. But, the valuation story and long-term total return potential at $3 appear to be quite extraordinary. With a business model growing algae and selling both natural and refined products through a similar balance sheet over the decades, while its ponds/supplies are largely under management control in-house located in Hawaii, the biggest operating risk might be supply-chain related.

Adding new delivery complexities and costs, shipping necessary parts/inputs and finished product on and off a remote island in the Pacific Ocean during the pandemic boat/plane shortage was likely a headwind. Today's obstacle, quickly rising oil/gas prices will again increase shipping expense. Nevertheless, I cannot find a material impact on operations from this variable between 2020-21, as selling prices were raised and other costs controlled to keep margins in a normal zone. Absent wartime shortages of delivery ships and planes, or the closure of a nearby airport, shipping schedules and costs should not be a huge issue this year either.

Outlier risks for its single pond and packaging location include weather changes or a catastrophic hurricane, earthquakes, labor shortages, and fresh-water access from the local utility.

I have been buying shares over the last week and may add to my position in the coming weeks. Investor downside for the whole fundamental and technical setup may be limited to a share price of $2.50 or $2.75 the rest of the year, using a minimum of breakeven profitability and a tangible book value around $3.00 per share like the recent past. The upside argument is not difficult to understand. If the company gets to $50 million in annualized revenues in 12 months, with $5 million in after-tax GAAP operating income and $6 million in free cash flow, an equity market capitalization of $50-60 million may be in order. That would equal a target price zone of $8-10 per share by early 2023.

If the organization is about to embark on an extended high-growth path as an additive business for other health foods, or perhaps move into seaweed production for livestock globally, the investment upside is huge and hard to quantify currently for shareholders.

Remember: Cyanotech is a micro-cap, not just a small capitalization pick. It should remain a very minor part of portfolio construction, because a major health-related lawsuit by product users or a government order to halt sales could theoretically torpedo its stock without warning. The good news is its longevity in business without running into unforeseen, catastrophic road-bumps should mean such an outcome is a low-probability event.

In terms of trading strategy, I would avoid at-the-market price orders. The stock is somewhat illiquid, so you could get stuck with an execution 5 cents, 10 cents or more above the latest trade quote. I suggest breaking up your intended position into 3 or 4 buy lots, with limit orders around current trade executions.

Energy crisis lifeline: ‘Green diesel’ produced from microalgae could replace fossil fuels,"E10 biofuel: Department for Transport explains why it’s ‘better'

Biofuel is the name given to any liquid fuel derived from biomass — that is, material like plant matter, algae, or animal waste. Unlike fossil fuels, which took millions of years to form, biofuels are produced rapidly and can therefore be easily replenished, meaning that they are categorised as renewable. This does not mean, however, that biofuels are always inherently good for the environment. While their production can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere — and many burn cleaner than fossil fuels — some still result in a net increase of greenhouse gases.

In their study, engineer Professor José Coelho Vargas of the Federal University of Paraná, Brazil, and his colleagues worked with the microalgae species Tetradesmus obliquus. This particular tiny aquatic organism has elongated, spineless cells and can commonly be found in freshwater environments — and can biosynthesise hydrocarbons, which would be used to produce fuel. The team said: “Microalgae are autotrophic organisms that can fix carbon dioxide as a primary carbon source. “Therefore, due to the combination of high biomass productivity and great efficiency in synthesising and accumulating fatty acids, they emerge as ideal hydrocarbon production beings.”

Fossil fuels could be replaced by ‘green diesel’ produced by the cultivation of microalgae

An advantage of microalgae is how they can be grown in compact photobioreactors, pictured

A particular advantage of producing biofuel from microalgae — over crops like corn or sugarcane — is that it can be grown in so-called photobioreactors. Because these can be built up vertically, they have a much more compact footprint, making industrial-scale production easier to realise. The researchers grew T. obliquus in large-scale photobioreactors. Each comprised more than 12,000 feet of clear PVC tubing, giving the algae access to sunlight for photosynthesis.

This chromatogram allows the identification of the hydrocarbons in the fuel — such as undecane (1)

For a cultivation medium, the team used bio-digested swine manure, a substance that is rich in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. After 15 days, the team removed the dry biomass from the reactors. From this, they extracted oil — via the addition of a mixture of hexane and ethanol — for subsequent distillation. In tests of the resulting fuel, the team found that the so-called “lower heating value” of their distilled oil was comparable to that of low-sulphur diesels, at 41,952 compared with 42,093 kilojoules per kilogram. The team reported: “A lower heating value approximately equal to fossil low-sulphur diesel and high ignition quality qualify microalgae-derived ‘green’ diesel for diesel engines utilisation.” In future, they said, green diesel could be used as an advanced motor fuel to replace fossil fuels “without engine performance loss”.

"Reduction of environmental chemicals, toxicity and particulate matter in wet scrubber device to achieve zero emissions","A model of wet scrubber, flue gas passage and water pipe connections was created using the CATIA 3D software package. A test was conducted to know the effective particle filtration percentage in the wet scrubber. Step by step procedure was followed to implement the test method. A filtration tank was attached to the wet scrubber in the proposed model to make necessary improvements in the design of the wet scrubber, as shown in Fig. 1a. Skilful and compact test equipment or analytical and simulation software called computational fluid dynamics fluidity, using the commercially available ANSYS software would be imparting to know the dynamic motion of the flow and particles in scrubber its effective flow visible results could be seen theoretically test could manage on the existing model of wet scrubber35,36,37 as well as on the proposed design with boundary conditions. Introducing polluted water processing filtration tank by selecting three types of sand filters for more effective filtering technology, in the form of fine particles, the flue gases were filtered in the wet scrubber.

Figure 1 (a) Wet scrubber and sand flirtation setup, (b) multi filtration zones (porosity and zone height). Full size image

The input of mass entering into the scrubber unit method is 0.6 kg/s. Generally, the wet scrubber is a pollution control device that reduces the power of the harmful gases coming out from the furnace38,39,40. The treated gas is passed into the chimney, and it is exhausted into the atmosphere. During the wet scrubber process, the air is drained through a mist of water which is created by the nozzle spray; by using separators, water droplets with dust and particles can be removed. Industrial scrubbers are mainly used for removing the potentially harmful pollutants and polluting gas emitted from the various industrial processes. Gases which have the most potent side effects and removal is essential, which include sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) gases from combustion by utilities and industries and a wide variety of by-products and waste gases such as chlorine (Cl 2 ), hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S)41. Initially, in the existing method, the flue gases coming out from the furnace are passed through a duct line. The blower sucks the gases and delivers them into the wet scrubber unit.

The harmful gases coming out of the furnace are most dangerous to exhaust into the atmosphere. Hence, it needs to be treated for exhaust in the atmosphere. There is a barrel of water placed under the wet scrubber unit. The water is pumped into the wet scrubber in two stages. The water was sprayed into the wet scrubber unit. The flue gases were washed by the water on the scrubber unit. The water collects the heavy particles, ashes, and the same barrel.

The same water is recalculated continuously to the wet scrubber unit. The water gets polluted. Secondary pollution was formed in the water. The secondary pollution affects the proposed method. The solar evaporation tank is replaced by a sand filter. Additionally, a polluted water filtration tank was introduced42,43,44,45. This unit is placed under the wet scrubber unit. Here the polluted water was purified. The sand filters are placed inside the barrel at three different heights. First of all, the sands used in this method are washed thoroughly.

The dirty particle in the sand is removed by this washing. The sand gets purified. Crusher sand is filled in the sand filter at the first stage. Natural river sand is filled in the sand filter at the second stage. The white sand is filled in the sand filters at the third stage, as shown in Fig. 1b. The heavy particles of water and dust that comes out from the wet scrubber unit are passed into the new barrel tank shown in Fig. 1a.

The sludge was stabled on the sand particles in the first stage. The minute particles escaping from the first stage are captured in the second and third stages. So, the water collected at the bottom of the tank was purified. Thus, the secondary pollution was eliminated from the water, and the pure water passed into the wet scrubber unit. The resulting performance of the wet scrubber unit gets improved.

Boundary condition

Table 1 shows the flow medium of the wet scrubber boundary condition in the inlet and outlet. Models Used for wet scrubber CFD analysis has Multiphase (mixture) of flue gas, dust (granular) and water, as shown in Fig. 2a.

Models Used for sand filtration CFD analysis has a Discrete Phase for Dust Particles, as shown in Fig. 2b. a computation was done with flow parameters, as shown in Table 1.

Governing equations and computational technique

In this simulation, the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) was applied to solve the complex flow behaviour. The transient state condition was applied for simulation. The discretization scheme such as SIMPLEC method was established in pressure–velocity pairing. The second-order upwind method was executed for kinetic energy, dissipation rate and momentum for obtaining the exactness in convergence. The time step size was given as 0.001 s. The total number of time steps was given as 1200. The total flow time of this simulation is 1.2 s. The maximum number of iterations per time step was set as 20. In addition, the convergence criterion such as 10–3 and 10–4 values are set for normalized residuals and scaled residuals for obtaining the accuracy in convergence47.

Model validation

The dust particles present in the flue gas were toxic, and it also has carcinogenic components46. Hence secondary filtration is carried out by spraying the water with a velocity of 5 m/s through the water processing system. Flue gas velocity is considered as 1.2 m/s. Springing action trapped the fine particles and fall down due to gravity and collected in the filtration tank through the outlet pipe set up in the wet scrubber, for which a processing tank for better trapping is introduced in the wet scrubber system, and the input is the same as in the existing method and output has been set up after at the processing tank, collected waste without a slurry. The fine particles enter into the wet scrubber, particles are partially trapped inside the wall, and the remaining filtering is done at the filtration tank while particles are passing through it. An automatic unstructured mesh was generated using the ANSYS workbench for the wet scrubber and sand filter mixed element type, as listed in Table 2.

Table 2 Building a mesh for the wet scrubber and sand filter model. Full size table

Meshing is the process of splitting the computational domain. Figure 2c shows the meshed model of the wet scrubber; the wet scrubber model was split into 46,150 elements with mixed element types, i.e. with both Hexa and tri elements. Figure 2d shows the meshed model of the filtration tank; the filtration tank model was split into 77,260 elements with mixed element type, i.e. with both Hexa and tri elements.

The gird independence study (GIS) was executed to validate the mesh quality. In GIS, five types of mesh, such as 44,150, 44,650, 45,150, 45,650 and 46,150, were generated for the wet scrubber to validate the mesh quality. For the sand filter, five types of the mesh, such as 75,260, 75,760, 76,260, 76,760 and 77,260, were generated to validate the quality of the grid. One of the output parameters, such as maximum pressure, was considered for validating the mesh size. It was found that the maximum error percentage obtained between each mesh size is less than 1%. It indicates that the generated mesh is in excellent condition. However, for avoiding the computational uncertainty largest mesh size was selected for simulation.",,[],"['Ramaswamy', 'Mechanical Engineering Department', 'College Of Engineering', 'Technology', 'Dambi Dollo University', 'Dambi Dollo', 'Centre For Excellence In Indigenous Knowledge', 'Innovative Technology Transfer', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Jule']"
Zero waste water,"ASU researchers see potential in wastewater

When you think about wastewater — if you do at all — you probably think of reeking, worthless sewage that you flush down the toilet or sink and never think about again. When Bruce Rittmann thinks about wastewater, he sees potential.

Rittmann is a researcher at Arizona State University who is leading a project using the greenhouse gases produced through wastewater treatment to generate electricity, create biofuel and possibly even make ice cream — all thanks to microalgae.

The three-year project, funded by the Department of Energy, is culminating in a six-week trial with the city of Mesa’s Northwest Water Reclamation Plant in Sloan Park near the Salt River.

“The city of Mesa has anaerobic digesters, is located close to ASU, is always eager to try out advanced technologies, and has been a great research and development partner with our center for some years,” says Rittmann, a Regents Professor in the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment and director of the Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology at the Biodesign Institute.

Rittmann has been involved in research using gas-transfer membranes — the basis for this project — for 20 years and has been using this technology with microalgae for over a decade. By pairing up with the city and getting access to their anaerobic digesters, which treat wastewater, his team has been able to scale the project up massively.

Not only does wastewater smell bad, it’s also a major problem for the environment. Wastewater treatment produces biogas made up of methane and carbon dioxide (CO2), the biggest contributors to climate change.

Typically, wastewater treatment facilities burn the biogases they produce. This eliminates the methane, which converts to carbon dioxide in the burning process.

“So now you're just emitting CO2. Of course, I think we're all familiar now with CO2 being a problem,” says Justin Flory, an associate director of research in ASU’s Center for Negative Carbon Emissions and project manager of the trial. “It's less of a problem than methane, but it's still a problem.”

People are not going to stop producing wastewater. In fact, as the population grows, we’re probably only going to produce more of it. But the very problem that wastewater treatment creates could provide value instead.

This project proposes a better solution with no burning required. The researchersThe ASU team also includes Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown, Yen-Jung Lai, Michelle Young, Zoe Frias, John McGowen, Robert Stirling and Jason Quinn, with the added support of Carole Flores. Several city of Mesa team members were instrumental in making this possible, including Tom Sheber, Roy Van Leeuwen and Jesus Mendez. take the carbon dioxide produced by treating wastewater and feed it to microalgae, which can then be turned into a variety of products. The process also takes the methane produced and generates purer biomethane, which is a high-value product.

“It’s a great opportunity to partner with ASU to develop technologies that will help us meet our sustainability goals while ASU meets their goals of continuing to lead the world in innovation,” says Scott Bouchie, the city of Mesa’s director of environmental management and sustainability.

Capturing greenhouse gases with green goo

If the heart of this project is to convert greenhouse gases into useful products, microalgae is the stomach.

Wastewater treatment at Northwest Water Reclamation Plant involves anaerobic digestors. These are large, dome-shaped reactors filled with microorganisms — like bacteria — that break down organic material in the biosolids produced as part of wastewater treatment. One output of anaerobic digestion is biogas, which is a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide.

The water reclamation facility captures and compresses those gases for storage in tanks. Normally it is burned to generate heat, which emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. For the ASU project, they deliver some of that biogas to three, 270-square-foot algae ponds located near the digesters.

The ponds were designed by staff at ASU’s Arizona Center for Algae Technology and Innovation and fabricated by students with the assistance of Everett Eustance, an assistant research scientist in the Swette Center who is also the lead researcher running the cultivation trial.

The biogas is delivered directly through thin, hollow fibers placed directly in the ponds. The carbon dioxide diffuses through the membranes of the fibers into the water, where the microalgae consume it for their photosynthetic growth.

The process can deliver carbon dioxide to the microalgae with nearly 100% transfer efficiency — this means that nearly all of the carbon dioxide present in the biogas is used instead of being released into the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide delivery also increases the microalgae’s growth rate and lowers the cost of its production.

“The CO2 content of the atmosphere is too low to support high productivity, which means that delivering concentrated CO2 is one key aspect of increasing microalgae productivity and lowering the costs of the products derived from the microalgae,” Eustance says.

What happens to the methane? Most of it goes out the end of the fibers, where it is captured for later use. Because almost all the carbon dioxide has been removed, the exiting gas is a purer form of biomethane.

“The city of Mesa just passed a council-approved Climate Action Plan that has aspirational goals of carbon neutrality, 100% renewable energy and waste diversion of 90% by 2050,” Bouchie says. “The project we’re working on today will help us take a step towards those goals.”

Turning waste into valuable commodities

The whole process keeps the biogases out of the atmosphere. But what can be done with the end products?

“That enriched methane can be used to make electricity or it can run your gas stove in your house or fuel those natural gas buses that run around town,” Flory says.

The microalgae grown from the CO2 can be used in a wide variety of products.

“We can convert that biomass into many different things,” Flory says. “Some microalgae are high in protein and omega three fatty acids and can be used to feed animals or fish. There are even compounds in microalgae that we use today in ice cream.”

Microalgae can also be converted into biofuels.

“Think about how fossil fuels are created — heat and pressure underground over time converts old organic material, like plants, into fossil fuels. That takes millions or thousands of years, but there is technology being developed that can do it in minutes,” Flory says.

The microalgae can be mashed down into a slurry and be pressured cooked until it becomes a crude biofuel. Biofuels are non-toxic and a renewable source of energy. They also create a closed cycle — the biofuel will still release some carbon dioxide, but it can be eaten by new microalgae grown to make more biofuel.

The city of Mesa is enthusiastic about the positive financial effects this project could have on their water reclamation facilities.

“We are grateful to have ASU’s involvement in this research project,” said Mesa City Councilmember Mark Freeman. “The possibility of reducing the plant’s operating costs by using biogas to generate electricity is an exciting prospect.”

Going from a lab to the real world

The researchers know that all these things are possible in theory, but can they work in practice? Scaling up from a lab using synthetic gases to a working treatment plant presents a less consistent — but more realistic — environment. Partnering with the city of Mesa is monumentally important to the scientific process, helping to identify real-world challenges and how to overcome them.

Since this process relies on the effective growth of microalgae, the team needs to keep the same things in mind that the average plant-parent does at home. Plants need sun, water and the right climate. Algae are no different, and inconsistencies and other issues with these three things can affect how well the algae grows.

In general, Arizona is a good location because of how much sunlight is available year-round. Even so, sunlight brings its own problems.

“Sunlight needs to reach the bottom of the pond to be effective. If you have a very dense culture, that sunlight can’t penetrate it,” Flory says.

This puts a limit on the amount of microalgae that can be grown in each pond. To get around this, the team has determined the optimal density for the microalgae that will still allow a sufficient amount of it to be grown.

“Water is a rare resource in the desert, so that’s another challenge we face,” Flory says.

Fortunately, at a wastewater reclamation plant, water is openly available, and that water can’t be used for drinking.

Weather could further affect the microalgae’s growth. In a lab, it’s relatively easy to have a consistent environment, but outdoor weather naturally changes.

“Algae do well in warm climates. As it starts to cool down here, the microalgae will grow slower and won’t take up as much CO2,” Flory says.

As we edge into wintertime, the impact of the project and the products generated may slow down. Although cold weather could mean less carbon dioxide is consumed, there is still an overall decrease from what would normally be released.

To address this concern, the team has run the trial through the end of November, utilizing strains of algae that can thrive in cooler weather.

Looking toward the future ​​​​​​​

After this project ends, the team is hoping to conduct another trial with the city of Mesa early next year.

The next time around, the team plans to include another waste stream that the wastewater treatment process generates. This waste stream contains leftover liquid from the anaerobic digestors that would provide necessary nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus for the microalgae to grow — and it can be pumped directly into the microalgae ponds.

“It would be the whole shebang. We’d be getting our nutrients from the wastewater and the CO2​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ to feed the microalgae,” Flory says.

This would mean the project would truly be a closed cycle. Essentially every waste produced by the treatment process would be used up.

“Innovative programs like this one could create new opportunities to improve Mesa operations on behalf of our residents,” says Mesa Mayor John Giles. “We’re really proud to be working with them on this research project, which is also another positive step toward our climate action plan goals.”

This trial is a good jumping off point to show other cities that there’s a solution for cutting back on greenhouse gas emissions by wastewater treatment facilities.

“Residents of Arizona see a need to really change the way we operate today,” Bouchie says. “It seems like there’s a lot of things we call waste that truly are not waste — they're resources.”

Why algae can be our next secret weapon to combat plastic pollution - Canadian Plastics,"Microalgae are the most promising nature-based candidate capable of destroying microplastics.

Plastic pollution has become an alarming problem worldwide. A 2015 study published in Science Magazine projected that by 2025, around 100-250 million metric tons of plastic waste could enter our oceans every year.

The problem also triggered the United Nations (UN) to issue a global resolution to end plastic waste, adopted by representatives from 173 countries.

However, even if all drastic measures were put in place to stop plastic production tomorrow, we would still have around 5 billion tonnes of plastic waste in landfills and the environment.

Research has shown that plastic can disintegrate into microplastic – particles ranging from 1 nanometer (nm) to less than 5 micrometres (mm) – with various shapes, densities, and mechanical and chemical properties.

Advertisement

Due to their small volume and high surface area, microplastics can absorb pollutants, causing chronic toxicity when consumed and accumulated within organisms.

For decades, scientists have been looking to nature for our fight against the plastic problem. Combined with global strategic action to slow down plastic production, we could prevent future plastic disasters.

Microalgae, for instance, are the most promising nature-based candidate capable of destroying microplastics. It is a unicellular species that exists individually or in chains or groups. Depending on the species, their size can range from a few millimetres to hundreds of micrometres.

Cultivating microalgae is simple because it does not require fertile land, large quantities of freshwater, and pesticides compared to other aquaculture crops.

Microalgae are also capable of growing rapidly. Open pond cultivation has been one of the oldest and simplest ways to cultivate microalgae on a large scale. Some people also use photobioreactors – bioreactors used in an enclosed system to increase microalgae cultivation.

How microalgae works

Interaction between microalgae and plastic can significantly change the properties of plastic, including its biodegradation, the alteration of plastic density, and sinking behaviour. Moreover, microalgae may take control, gather, and stick to microplastics on their surface, regardless of their size.

There are four stages of plastic biodegradation. First is the attachment of microalgae to plastic surfaces. This starts the biodegradation process and alters surface properties.

The second is biodeterioration. Microalgae will secrete specific enzymes, which are pivotal for plastic biodegradation.

The third is the biofragmentation process. In this stage, the plastic material loses its mechanical stability and becomes fragile.

The last stage is the assimilation process, where microbial filaments and water start to penetrate plastics, which results in the decomposition and utilisation of plastic by microorganisms.

Studies have reported success stories of algae-based plastic biodegradation, particularly for polyethylene (commonly used in fibres for clothing or bottle), low-density polyethylene or LDPE (used in plastic bags) and bisphenol A or BPA (chemicals to harden plastic). One of those studies calculated a 58.9% decrease of carbon composition in their LDPE sample.

More action is needed

As the biggest archipelagic country, Indonesia has a maritime area of over 6.4 million square kilometres and extensive freshwater lakes which have immense potential for microalgae cultivation.

Microalgae could be a viable solution to tackle the plastic problem in Indonesia – the world’s second-largest ocean plastic polluter, according to a 2015 study.

More research is vital to deepen analyses of microalgae and microplastics’ interactions and their effects to support this initiative. So far, studies on microalgae in Indonesia only focus on its potential as a green energy resource or its capacity to become a substitute material for plastic.

To prevent plastic disasters, we also need improvements in plastic recycling and reusing strategies. Regulation and policies should be in line with the 2018-2015 National Action Plan on Marine Debris which highlights Indonesia’s waste management, reduction or substitution of plastic usage, redesign of plastic products and packaging, doubling plastic waste collection rates, and expansion of waste disposal facilities.

Playing the long game: ExxonMobil gambles on algae biofuel,"Algae biofuel initially looked promising, but a few key problems have thwarted major research efforts, including development of a strain of algae able to produce plentiful cheap fuel, and scaling up to meet global energy demand.

Other alternative energy solutions, including wind and solar power, are outpacing algae biofuel advances.

Much more investment in money and time is needed for algae biofuel to become viable, even on an extended timeline out to mid-century. While big players like Shell and Chevron have abandoned the effort, ExxonMobil continues work.

In 2017, ExxonMobil, with Synthetic Genomics, announced they had used CRISPR gene-editing technology to make an algal strain that could pave the way to a low-carbon fuel and a sustainable future. But many environmentalists met the claim with skepticism, suspecting greenwashing.

Algae biofuel research had an early surge in the 1970s-90s. Then, during a brief window of time, from roughly 2009 to around 2017, this alternative fuel technology became the darling of the renewable alternative energy industry. It was hailed as a solution to many of the world’s climate woes due to algae’s ability to capture carbon without significantly raising food prices, as was potentially the case with other biomass fuels sourced from corn, soy and sugarcane.

Predicted to be a big winner, algae biofuel was fast-tracked into research and development by biotech companies in league with major corporations, including Shell, Chevron and Exxon.

But, after numerous setbacks, failed tests and enormous unanticipated production costs, algae biofuel today is no longer a firm favorite, with many companies dropping out of the race, including both Chevron and Shell.

Still, even with its initial shine dulled, it remains today a tantalizing nature-based climate change solution, with some companies — including ExxonMobil — still actively pursuing it.

What are algae and algae biofuels?

“What are algae?” proves to be a surprisingly complex question. They are among the simplest organic producers in the world, using light and carbon dioxide to make biomass. Green algae, for example, use photosynthesis to grow. But algae aren’t only classed as plants. Rather, they’re a highly varied and genetically diverse group of organisms hailing from across four biological kingdoms: Bacteria, Chromista, Plantae, and Protozoa.

Latest research estimates that there are anywhere between 30,000 and 1 million algae species on Earth, with diversity that astounds, ranging from microscopic diatoms (single-celled marine organisms that produce more than 20% of the world’s oxygen), to giant sea kelp (reaching heights of 100 feet, or 30 meters). Algae contain the building blocks of all organic life: proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids — with lipids especially and potentially useful in energy production

Making algae into biofuel starts in a lab, where each strain is tested and then modified genetically to grow faster and be richer in lipids, the non-water-soluble fatty acids that produce algae oil, the essential ingredient of the hoped-for liquid biofuel. According to recent research by the Indian Institute of Technology, microalgae can contain 15 to 77% oil, making it an attractive candidate for biodiesel.

Finding, testing and finessing algae strains to grow stronger and faster — turning them into biofuel superstars — is what’s called bioprospecting. And doing so is both expensive and time-consuming.

Over the years, achieving a revolutionary algae biofuel technology breakthrough (rapidly growing and developing lipid-rich algae in the lab) was seen by the industry as the equivalent of being dealt a royal straight flush in poker: something to be worked and hoped for, but very hard to achieve in the alternative fuels game, and always a long shot.

But creating the perfect microalgae would be just the first step. Then researchers needed to harvest the algae, break down the cell walls with chemical solvents, then extract the inner lipids, proteins and carbs, which undergo a final processing step to convert them into biofuel. Then, of course, there was the need to scale up the entire process, growing the microalgae at an industrial scale in vast outdoor pools requiring huge amounts of land and tremendous quantities of fresh or salt water.

This daunting complexity explains why the algae biofuel industry today continues to be a specialized and very expensive game, only played by those who can afford and tolerate high risk. Whether it’s scientists playing against time; venture capitalists betting for big short-term gains over distant long-term profits; or biotech firms trying to make a fast buck, without spending two, to achieve a viable product — most are ultimately losing against the house.

Some major players stymied by the science

Most innovation in algae biofuel technology is funded and pursued by private companies such as Algenol in Florida, or Synthetic Genomics in Southern California. However, the U.S. government has also played a major part in funding projects and partnering with private organizations in the quest to find the ultimate algae strain (or several together) that will compete successfully on a cost-effective level with fossil fuels.

Historically, for most companies, that winning hand never came, or may be still decades away. Companies including Algenol and TerraVia Holdings (formerly Solazyme) that initially invested heavily in algae biofuel in the first decade of the aughts pivoted away from the search several years ago, instead producing algae-based consumer goods. Some, like Sapphire Energy, despite the pivot, folded. As already noted, both Shell and Chevron, which originally invested heavily in the technology, have abandoned the effort.

Why the frenzy, then decline? What has been learned across companies and organizations, in labs and government offices, is that the science is a lot tougher than initially thought.

While other renewable energy alternatives, namely solar, wind and geothermal, have made big strides over the last 15 years in terms of innovation, cost reduction and implementation, algae biofuel still languishes in the research and development phase.

Even with advancements in gene editing such as CRISPR technology, it will likely take a lot more investment — many millions of dollars — to make the algae biofuel science work, say experts. And most companies, initially backed by venture capitalists, don’t have the second- and third-round funding needed to stay in the game.

Government support critical

In the early Wild West days of alternative energy investment, algae biotechnology looked so promising that the U.S. government ponied up in a major way.

Biotech firm Solazyme, for example, was awarded approximately $22 million to construct an algae biorefinery project by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). During its meteoric rise, Solazyme also received a Department of Defense contract to provide the U.S. Navy with algae-based fuel, while also collecting numerous national renewable energy accolades. Then, in 2017, TerraVia Holdings, formerly Solazyme, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Today, after the pullout of many private companies, and a number of costly failed attempts at producing a working liquid fuel out of algae at scale, it’s a lot harder to create lasting partnerships, or to acquire federal funds.

U.S. government officials, such as Daniel Fishman, the technology manager at the DOE’s Bioenergy Technology Office (BETO), remain pensive but hopeful for algae’s future. “We are really excited about the decarbonizing products coming into the economy and are driving our efforts,” he says, referring to U.S. President Joe Biden’s goal to greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions via a massive overhaul in climate change policy.

In fact, the administration is turning again to biofuels to help answer some of the nation’s more head-scratching energy problems. “Alternatives that might make sense for cars don’t really work with the aviation industry,” notes Fishman.

As recently as April, the DOE had committed $61.4 million to new biofuel research, and is currently taking proposals. “Biofuels are one of our most promising paths to zero-carbon aviation and shipping,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm.

Still, Fishman says he is hesitant to make any precise algae biofuel forecasts, but says the DOE and its partners are on track to meet a commitment to demonstrate significant algae growth on a specified amount of land, and to scaling up production in outdoor ponds by 2025.

A 2050 goal, reached via public and private partnerships, is to discover, finesse and produce an algae strain that proves itself to be cost-competitive with fossil fuels on the energy market.

How the science works

Amanda Barry is the research and development manager at Sandia National Labs in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She is also the primary investigator of LEAF (Leveraging Algae Traits for Fuel) projects under DOE’s BETO program.

For her, a good day in the lab is when the algae stay green, because many, she explains, die while in the genetic-testing phase.

Once a well-growing strain is found in one lab, it can be shared, tested and integrated nationally with the DOE BETO-funded Development of Integrated Screening, Cultivar Optimization, and Verification Research (DISCOVR) project, a consortium of national laboratories (of which Sandia National Laboratories is one) that are dedicated to testing algae strains for productivity potential in the research pipeline.

Along with tailoring algae cultivation systems, researchers at Sandia are also trying out methods to make algae grow faster, and capable of being grown outdoors in large raceway ponds, where a paddle keeps the water in constant motion.

The royal straight flush Sandia Labs is seeking is a strain of algae capable of growing quickly and robustly with minimal nutrients outdoors — one perhaps with precisely the right lipid chain to one day be used as a jet fuel.

Synthetic Genomics teams up with ExxonMobil

Synthetic Genomics, a biotech company founded 15 years ago, is headquartered in La Jolla, California, a locale rich in both sun and saltwater, making it ideal for algae research.

The company has another big biofuel industry edge, however. Synthetic Genomics is one of the last major biotech labs to have an invaluable partnership with a large corporation that can throw millions of dollars into research and development. That partner is ExxonMobil, the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company.

In 2017, ExxonMobil announced that it, along with Synthetic Genomics, had used CRISPR gene-editing technology to produce an algal strain that the oil company said could pave the way to a low-carbon fuel and a sustainable future that would “reduce the risk of climate change.”

But after years of research, and so many other high-tech industry failures, some environmentalists question the motives of ExxonMobil’s ongoing funding of research to find the Holy Grail: the ultimate energy-producing microalgae strain.

Critics particularly wonder whether the fossil fuel giant (known for its long-running climate disinformation campaigns) may be more interested in the PR and greenwashing opportunities offered by being associated with the alternative biofuel technology.

Ever since the 2017 CRISPR announcement, ExxonMobil has used social media — including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter — to share its “Miniature Science” campaign, claiming that microalgae could “fuel the trucks, ships and planes of tomorrow,” while taking CO 2 out of the environment, according to a critique by Joseph Winters, published in the Harvard Political Review.

Analysts point out that algae biomass, whether used as fuel, a food or drink supplement — all algae, everywhere, in fact — will indeed take CO 2 out of the environment. But critically, everything depends on scale. Current algae biofuel cultivation capabilities cannot even remotely offset the massive amounts of carbon that ExxonMobil’s nonrenewable fuels pump into the atmosphere annually — the company’s net greenhouse gas releases totaled approximately 120 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2019.

Regardless of ExxonMobil’s motives, Synthetic Genomics seems secure in its partnership, and even continued its research during the pandemic. Michele Rubino, a Synthetic Genomics representative, said the company has doubled down on its algae research in the last three or four years, divesting from other programs to commit solely to finding a solution to the algae problem.

However, he is straightforward and realistic about algae’s potential to replace nonrenewable fuel. “We don’t think it will ever compete, it’s just not going to happen,” Rubino says. “Oil and petroleum have a 150 years head start.”

So why keep at it? Rubino explains that while the work is slow and steady, progress is being made. The company went outdoors two years ago, and its pond-grown strains are showing promise of keeping the company’s and ExxonMobil’s goal of producing 10,000 barrels per day of algae fuel by 2025. According to its latest report, ExxonMobil’s current daily output includes 4 million barrels of oil and natural gas.

The long road ahead

Whatever happens with the ExxonMobil-Synthetic Genomics collaboration, their path to fruition is fraught with troublesome stumbling blocks.

Contamination is one concern: What happens, ask environmentalists, if and when gene-altered algae find their way into the natural world? Could a robust microalgae, genetically modified to grow super-fast, disrupt ecosystems, wreaking havoc on native algae and other aquatic organisms?

Rubino assured Mongabay that the algae developed in the Synthetic Genomics labs are more threatened by the natural world than the opposite. “Because they are grown in a lab, it makes them remarkably disadvantaged in the real world,” he says.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency seems to agree with that assessment. It recently approved one of Synthetic Genomics’ strains for outdoor use. To obtain that approval, the algae needed to be tested in air, soil and water.

Other questions: water, land, fertilizer and energy consumption. When biotech companies began experimenting with large outdoor algae ponds, freshwater usage was a major concern, though most research today, including that by Synthetic Genomics, is using plentiful saltwater to grow algae. The use of large amounts of synthetic nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer for cultivation is another worry, as global overuse has already drastically destabilized Earth’s biogeochemical natural cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus, causing vast ocean dead zones. Another large issue is the amount of energy and land area needed to bring algae biofuel production up to scale.

That question of scale may be the ultimate sticking point: even if ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics achieve their 10,000 barrels per day production goal by 2025, that is just a drop in the bucket compared to the 97,103,871 barrels of oil used planetwide every day. Upscaling algae biofuel to compete against the oil produced worldwide is clearly a long time away.

Which begs the question again: why keep investing? Why continue down this long, hard road, when payout may be minimal, falling far short of the grand dream of a world-saving renewable fuel empowered by human ingenuity — a royal straight flush for the ages?

Just like algae’s potential, the end game remains to be seen.

Design and fabrication of box-type passive solar dryer (BTPSD) with thermal insulation material for valorizing biomass and neutral lipids of marine Chlorella vulgaris for biodiesel application,"The significant steps in microalgal biodiesel production entail feedstock selection, cultivation, harvesting, drying/dewatering, oil extraction, and transesterification16. Among the steps, biomass drying is one of the imperative processes to remove the water content or moisture content present in the wet biomass. Though various modes of biomass drying have been proposed till now, a cost-effective and energy-efficient protocol is still under exploration. From this perspective, the present study has proposed box- type passive solar dryer for biomass and lipid drying in a cost-effective way. At the outset of the experimental work, the solar dryer with pertinent configurations needs to be chosen for efficient removal of moisture from algal biomass and also evaporating solvent from extracted lipids. Therefore, solar dryer with better thermal storage using different TIM thicknesses such as 2 cm and 4 cm were optimized initially using ANSYS software. The entire simulation was done with the ambient condition for three models; solar dryer with 2 cm TIM thickness, solar dryer with 4 cm TIM thickness and solar dryer without any TIM. For all three models, a similar temperature of 50 °C is fed as input to the top layer of the dryer. The simulation output of solar dryer with 2 and 4 cm TIM thickness and without TIM is shown in Fig. 1a–c. In the solar dryer with 4 cm TIM thickness, at 50 °C heat input, the absorber plate temperature varied from 74 to 77 °C, which is 4 °C higher than the solar dryer with 2 cm TIM thickness. For the solar dryer with 2 cm TIM thickness, the absorber plate temperature has varied only from 68 to 70 °C; because most of the heat flux is dissipated to the side and top wall of the dryer due to less thermal storage capability. Similarly, in the solar dryer with no TIM storage, the maximum absorber plate temperature was observed to be 65 °C. From the simulation results, it is ascertained that the optimum thickness of 4 cm TIM is efficient to valorize the algal biomass and lipids at higher temperature due to its better thermal storage. Generally, the performance of the solar dryer depends on the collector temperature, absorber temperature, air temperature, and TIM. The solar dryer without TIM can dissipate its absorber plate temperature to the environment during poor weather, and night time and thus, it may affect the drying of biological samples by taking a long time. To overcome this challenge, the solar dryer was fabricated with cost-effective glass wool (TIM) as thermal storage medium and tested for valorizing biomass and lipids of the microalga C. vulgaris. The biomass of the C. vulgaris strain dried under BTPSD with respect to drying time (h) was presented in Fig. 2. The initial wet weight of the sample was taken as 1.0 g. The biomass weight was reduced gradually with an increase in drying time due to the evaporation of the water. It is apparent that at 3 and 4 h drying time, the wet algal biomass has been completely dried in BTPSD and the final dry weight of the sample was estimated to be 0.18 g, whereas partial drying was noticed at 2 h drying time. From the results, it is known that 3 h drying time is sufficient to valorize/evaporate the maximum moisture content in the microalgal wet biomass using BTPSD.

Figure 2 The biomass of the C. vulgaris strain dried under BTPSD with respect to drying time (h). Full size image

On the other hand, the conventional hot air oven based drying of algal biomass was presented in Fig. 3. Like BTPSD, the same weight of wet biomass (1.0 g) was taken to study the weight loss with respect to drying time using Hot air oven. Unlike BTPSD, hot air oven has taken less time to dry the algal biomass, i.e., 2 h. The complete drying or complete removal of moisture was noticed at 2 h, and extending the drying up to 4 h did not reveal any remarkable change in the biomass weight due to no additional moisture removal and the final dry cell weight (DCW) of the taken sample was 0.18 g. Comparing both drying systems, the time taken for drying the algal sample by BTPSD and hot air oven is quite different. Though BTPSD requires an additionally 1 h for drying the sample compared to a hot air oven, the energy consumption and cost intensiveness are low in BTPSD.

Figure 3 The conventional hot air oven based drying of algal biomass with respect to time (h). Full size image

Further, it is interesting to note that the final weight of the dried sample from both methods was found to be the same at about 0.181 g DCW. This is attributed to the fact that 4 cm TIM is able to increase the absorber plate temperature above 65 °C in BTPSD, which will evaporate the water content in the biomass. Though the drying time taken by BTPSD is high compared to hot air oven, low energy usage and less capital investment made the BTPSD a frontline drying system than a hot air oven. The dried biomasses from BTPSD and hot air oven were subjected to neutral lipid extraction using hexane. The hexane layer containing neutral lipids was kept in both drying systems for evaporating solvent (hexane) from neutral lipids. The BTPSD based drying of hexane-containing neutral lipids extracted from C. vulgaris strain was given in Fig. 4, with respect to drying time (h). The initial weight of the hexane containing non-polar lipid/neutral lipid was 25.13 g. The evaporation of solvent from the lipids were noted at 0.5 h time interval from 0 to 4.5 h; results indicated that hexane in the neutral lipids were completely evaporated at 4 h drying time and extending the duration up to 4.5 h, no further reduction in lipid weight/ no further evaporation of hexane was observed. Therefore, 4 h drying time is adequate to evaporate the hexane from the neutral lipids in BTPSD. Meanwhile, the neutral lipid percentage of C. vulgaris dried under BTPSD was calculated and it was 11.5%. As a comparison, a similar weight of hexane containing neutral lipids extracted from C. vulgaris was also taken in Hot air oven to evaluate the drying time difference between BTPSD and hot air oven. Figure 5 illustrates the hot air oven-based drying of hexane containing neutral lipids extracted from C. vulgaris. Unlike BTPSD, hot air oven has evaporated the solvent in less time at 3.5 h, i.e., 0.5 h earlier than BTPSD. In hot air oven, evaporation of solvent from the neutral lipids was occurred gradually from 0th h to 3.5 h and extending the drying duration beyond 3.5 h did not result any variation in the neutral lipid content i.e., neutral lipid percentage of 3.5 h, 4 h and 4.5 h drying time was 11.80, 11.81 and 11.81%, respectively. Based on the results, it is observed that both in BTPSD and hot air oven drying, the percentage of neutral lipids did not vary concerning the drying time and drying methods. Though the drying time is somewhat lesser in a hot air oven than in BTPSD, the energy consumption or expensiveness of the hot air oven process is very high. Notably, the 0.5 h drying time difference between BTPSD and hot air oven is not remarkably big. Hot air oven-based drying is a mechanical method in which hot air is supplied to remove the moisture at set temperature and velocity and it is considered to be aseptic method and yields the dried product with enhanced uniformity7. But, BTPSD based valorization of biomass and lipid is advantageous in terms of energy consumption and cost intensiveness than hot air oven. Further, BTPSD fabricated in this study is cost-effective, aseptic, eco-friendly as the entire setup was made with transparent glass materials without electrical power supply. Glass plate has low convective and radiant heat loss from the absorber plate and also it transmits the incident solar radiation to the receiver plate with less heat dissipation with the environment. Different types of solar dryers are designed and fabricated by various researchers to remove the moisture content from different foods and agricultural products. Various studies used solar dryers for drying fruits and agricultural products such as mango, banana, pineapple, cherry and potato, etc.10. In direct/open solar dryer, the quality of end product may not be maintained for human consumption and also, slow drying time may cause degradation of biomass and subsequent increase in bacterial population due to low temperature15. That is why, in this study, a closed box-type solar dryer was fabricated to avoid the contamination of sample from air-borne microbes and also to attain high temperature by reducing much heat dissipation. A closed type dryer increases the rate of drying and it results in high quality dried biomass, and also, the cost of drying algal biomass is relatively very less when compared to other drying methods15. Solar dryer are basically classified into active and passive solar dryer according to the nature of air flow and mode of incident solar radiation. In an active/forced air drying system, forced air is supplied to the dryer through external collector channel. But, in this study, passive type solar dryer was fabricated, in which, the solar radiation is collected by the transparent glass plate and then absorbed by the receiver plate without any external air supply. Solar dryers have many advantages like inexpensiveness, emission free, lesser spoilage, hygienic and eco-friendly12. One significant limitation is that this system can be used only during day-time (Sunshine hours) and in this case, a thermal backup is necessary to operate the dryer during night time17. Many thermal storage materials are being used, including natural sources like wood, stones, concrete, sandstone, bricks, etc. However, they can be suited for sensible heat of energy storage with low and high heat storage application18. For better thermal backup, some advance phase change materials are preferred as thermal insulations, namely water, salt hydrates, paraffins, selected hydrocarbons, polymers and metal alloys. PCMs maintain the inside heat of the dryer according to their specific heat capacity of the thermal insulation19. Phase change material is used to absorb excess energy during sunshine hours and then discharge the same at night/evening hours to enhance the drying20,21. In this study, glass wool was used as thermal insulation material (TIM) in the BTPSD. The performance of the BTPSD and hot air oven was given in the Table 1. The moisture content and moisture removal percentage of both systems were similar, i.e., 82 and 81.8%, respectively. The total energy required and total electricity consumed by hot air oven to remove the moisture content from the algal biomass was 138 J/g and 0.0385 Wh, respectively while the electricity consumption and total energy required by solar dryer was zero. Interestingly, capital investment/manufacturing cost of the BTPSD system is also meager when compared to the hot air oven. In solar dryer, removing the moisture or solvents from the samples requires hot air, which will be supported in two ways; (i) natural convection- does not require any other subsystem and energy consumption is very less, (ii) forced convection- requires a specific air compressor to supply the air to the drying chamber and it increases the system complexity and results in higher energy consumption22. Further, entire design of solar dyer was classified into three types (a) direct solar dryer (b) DC heating Dryer (c) PV/T based solar dryer23. Of all the models described above, direct, box-type solar dryer was simple in fabrication and was found to have economic feasibility24. The neutral lipids dried under hot air oven and BTPSD was converted into biodiesel (FAME) through acid-catalyzed transesterification. The FAME content obtained from the neutral lipids dried under BTPSD and hot air oven was presented in Fig. 6. FAME yield under BTPSD and hot air oven methods were 94.5 and 94.2%, respectively. As the percentage of neutral lipids content in both conditions was similar, FAME percentage was also found to be tantamount. Further, the fatty acid profile of C. vulgaris lipids dried under BTPSD and hot air oven was presented in Table 2. Additionally, the heat map plotting of the fold change ratio of fatty acids under BTPSD and the hot air oven system was given in Fig. 7. The key fatty acids present in the C. vulgaris strain are palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidic acid (C20:0), cis-11, 14-Eicosadienoic acid (C20:2) and cis-8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3). The fatty acid composition/pattern was almost similar in both drying methods. Adding to that, the percentage of each fatty acid was virtually identical in both BTPSD and hot oven dried lipid samples. Among the fatty acids identified, palmitic acid is a predominant fatty acid in the concentration of 23.4% and then, oleic acid (14.3%), linolenic acid (11.42%), palmitoleic acid (9.22%) in BTPSD. Similarly, hot air oven dried lipid sample showed 23.9, 13.9, 11.98 and 9.13% palmitic acid, oleic acid, linolenic acid and stearic acid content, respectively. The significant fatty acids identified by the present study in the C. vulgaris are well consistent with various hitherto reports. A recent study reported that Chlorella vulgaris yields C16:0, C18:1, C18:2 as major fatty acids in its total FAME composition25. Photoautotrophically cultivated unialgal cultures of Chlorella vulgaris contain 16 to 18 carbon long-chain fatty acids; notably palmitic acid and oleic acid26. Another study has reported C. vulgaris (strain UMT-M1) yields C16:0 and C18:1 fatty acids in the concentration of 36.9 and 31.3% (of total oil content), respectively27. Palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid are the key fatty acids in the laboratory grown Chlorella sp., at about 33.42, 15.42, 20.3, 10.96 and 12.01%, respectively28. To utilize the microalgal strain for biodiesel application, fatty acid composition and contents have to be evaluated since the chemical features of each fatty acid govern the fuel quality based on its chain length and saturation29. It is reported that the fatty acid composition and its structure decide cetane number, viscosity and heat of combustion, and these fuel properties are linearly correlated with fatty acid chain length30. In this study, cetane number might be in the desirable range since both methods SFAs contents such as palmitic and stearic acid contents are high. Generally, the cetane number of palmitic acid and stearic acid is 74.5 and 86.926. Favourable cetane number range minimizes the white smoke formation and compression ignition delay31. In this study, fatty acid pool contains mixture of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). As shown in Table 2, percentage of SFAs, MUFAs and PUFAs in BTPSD method was 35.82, 23.52 and 31.18%, respectively while it was 36.69, 23.03 and 31.68%, respectively in hot air oven dried lipid sample. The presence of saturated fatty acids provides favorable cetane number for better oxidative stability of the biodiesel32,33, while higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids provides good cold flow properties to the biodiesel at low temperature since they have more than two double bonds34,35. Fuel properties of biodiesel is determined by the SFAs and UFAs ratio since SFAs will increase the longevity of biodiesel, while UFAs augments cold flow properties of biodiesel36. Interestingly, long chain MUFAs such as palmitoleic acid and oleic acid in this study are favorable since they impart both better cold flow characteristics and oxidative stability as they do not have bis-allylic carbon37,38. It is reported that the presence of monounsaturated oleic acid in biodiesel has become a compromise between cold flow properties and oxidative stability26. By and large, fatty acid composition and percentage of the neutral lipids dried under BTPSD is favorable for high quality biodiesel production.

Engineer Innovates Algae-Based Biofuel That’s Cheaper Than Petrol by Rs 27/Litre,"Editor’s Note: The article originally featured an image captioned as “Cultivation of microalgae in a pond at More Mileage’s manufacturing plant, Ranchi. (Source: Vishal Prasad Gupta)”. We regret to inform our readers that this caption was in error. The image reflected the work of Dr Sandhya Mishra and the team at the CSMCRI premises, in Bhavnagar. Dr Sandhya is a pioneer for microalgal biodiesel and mass cultivation. We apologise for the oversight.

In 2020, engineer Vishal Prasad Gupta received approval from the Union Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to set up ‘More Mileage’, his own petrol pump, in Ranchi, Jharkhand.

The 42-year-old has been credited with innovating a biofuel manufactured from a species of microalgae native to Jharkhand’s ponds, which he says is not only more environmentally friendly than petrol and diesel, but also easy on the pocket.

The biofuel, which can be used in all vehicles with EM590 diesel engines, costs Rs 78 per litre, a cheaper alternative to diesel, which is currently priced at Rs 92 in Ranchi. Meanwhile, bioethanol costs Rs 72, which Vishal says can replace petrol currently priced at Rs 99 per litre.

“I come from a petroleum family and always wanted to develop a carbon-neutral and cost-efficient fuel for the common man. My grandfather worked for Burma-Shell in 1932 (now Bharat Petroleum), and my father started working for Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) as a dealer in 1969 as well,” Vishal tells The Better India.

Vishal is in talks with civic officials to pursue a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ranchi Municipal Corporation, following which he would be able to make use of city dams for the cultivation of algae and manufacture biofuel on a larger scale.

Research and development

After graduating from the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Vishal worked as a marketing specialist with TotalEnergies SE (then Total France), a multinational oil and gas company that had an active MoU with IOC. He also worked with several other PSU (Public Sector Undertaking) units for 15 years before undertaking research work on third-generation fuels in 2018, when the Union Cabinet had also approved the Current National Policy on Biofuels.

Vishal partnered with Dr Kumar Bhupati, a professor at Birsa Krishi Vishwavidyalaya in Ranchi, who was researching microalgae as feed for livestock owing to its rich content of proteins, amino acids, minerals, and other nutrients. It was then that Vishal realised the algae had chemical components similar to those in crude oil, and that it could be used to develop biofuel.

It took about two months for him to receive approval for his creation by the Petroleum Conservation Research Association, Government of India. Vishal says that owing to the goodwill he enjoys in his hometown and a strong network in the industry, he was easily able to market his product. He claims to sell as much as 2,000-2,500 kls (kilolitres) of biofuel daily, and has sold around 2,50,000 kls of biofuel till date. He has also made commercial sales to Tata Motors (250 kls) and Damla Bharat Cement (500 kls).

Vishal owns a manufacturing plant alongside Namkum — one he bought from a friend who formerly sold karanja oil and mahua oil — with a daily production capacity of 70,000 kls. With a team of 35 employees, the plant has been operational since December 2020.

How does it work?

Explaining the process, Vishal said that a species of algae called Azolla pinnata, which contains a considerable quantity of oil, is taken out of the pond and put in a chemical compound called hexene. After being treated in the plant, it becomes a lipid in liquid form, following which it achieves the final form of biodiesel or bioethanol.

As much as 7,000 kls of biofuel is produced per batch of production, he says. While a little over 13 hours of sunlight over the plant’s 13 ponds is deemed integral to the process, the plant’s premises also have ultraviolet lamps to aid microalgae cultivation at night. Members of a local NGO help with harvesting the algae and aid the ponds’ upkeep. Vishal has also obtained permission from the civic authorities to make use of public ponds in the city.

“Algae grown on one acre of land can decrease the air quality index (AQI) of the area by 60 per cent. Besides being used as a biofuel source and livestock feed, it helps in creating antioxidants for beauty products and may be used for anti-cancer medicines,” claims Vishal.

Algae is also known for drastically reducing carbon dioxide emissions by converting them into oxygen (and biomass) via photosynthesis. “Removing algae from water bodies also helps clean them and reduce their pH levels, which are about 8-9 with the algae. Water used in the biofuel manufacturing process can also be treated into mineral water,” says Vishal.

Vishal, who lives with his mother and wife, said an algae-based “super fuel”, which would be fit for use in both petrol and diesel-run vehicles, is also in the works. He hopes the country can move past exporting crude oil and achieve self-reliance in terms of acquiring indigenous raw material to produce sustainable fuel.",,[],['Tulika Chaturvedi']
"Marine Cultivation Startup Yemoja Is Bringing Anti-Aging, Sustainable Microalgae to Cosmetics Companies","3 Mins Read

Marine cultivation start-up Yemoja recently launched microalgae-derived external polysaccharide sulphate (EPS), a bioactive component derived from Porphyridium cruentum species of microalgae. This component is in high demand in the cosmetics industry for its naturally tendering antiaging, anti-inflammatory, and rejuvenating properties.

Israeli firm Yemoja’s EPS-Revive is the first red algae sulphate for use in cosmetics produced in a controlled lab environment by employing high-precision and fast-track photobioreactor technology.



With the cosmetics market predicted to reach US$430B in global sales by 2022, there has been an increasing demand for natural cosmetics driving innovation.

The purity of algae



CEO of Yemoja, Erez Ashkenazi, said that all-natural cosmetic brands demand a consistent supply of superior quality algae. “More and more companies are working to create an ‘all-natural’ brand by using plant-based or algae-based substances, with emphasis on ‘green’ processes and chemical-free end products. While the demand for the product is high, Yemoja is a rare player in that we can provide a steady supply of valuable and standardized raw material. We cultivate only natural wild-strain algae through an automated, fully controlled and contaminant-free downstream process. We use no chemicals or solvents, and we do not exploit any natural resources from the environment and we are exploring possibilities for integrating our aqueous solution into food supplements and branching out to the beauty-from-within sector.”

This closed-cultivation system used by the company ensures that there is no reliance on external environmental components or effects from climate fluctuations, meaning that all year round, it can produce the EPS in gel form or as pure powder. Additionally, the company can choose to increase the quantity of sulphate bound to the EPS during the algae cultivation process.

While the demand for the product is high, Yemoja is a rare player in that we can provide a steady supply of valuable and standardized raw material. We cultivate only natural wild-strain algae through an automated, fully controlled and contaminant-free downstream process. We use no chemicals or solvents, and we do not exploit any natural resources from the environment Erez Ashkenazi, CEO of Yemoja

Creating clean cosmetics

CTO of Yemoja, Dr. Amikam Bar-Gill, said: “EPS molecules are synthesized within the red Porphyridium cruentum microalgae under high-stress conditions. This exerts a protective mechanism that safeguards the algae’s cells from dehydration, pH shifts, and bacterial infections. During cultivation, the EPS is secreted by the algae and dissolved within the growth media – seawater – which is later separated from the biomass for ultra-filtration in order to concentrate the EPS into its final gel form.”

An ex-vivo trial vouched for the benefits of EPS-Revive and showed that it helps protect the connective tissue between the dermal layers, with its sulfate content and structure, acting as a reactive oxygen species scavenger protecting the skin from aging and inhibited various inflammatory markers like TNF-a and IL6 cytokines.



With clinical trials conducted in Gdansk, Poland, the EPS-Revive can be incorporated into creams, lotions, and other topical applications. Going ahead, the company will conduct more trials over the next year and assess all the effects that can be used to maintain skin health for all skin types.

Yemoja further works to repurpose waste by using the biomass to produce intercellular polysaccharide sulphated (IPS) that can also be used in cosmetics. It is similar to the benefits of EPS and includes the algae’s red pigment, phycoerythrin, with the pigment having an immune-modulation activity. It is presently under research and can be used in natural cosmetics formulations as a colorant or an active ingredient.

“Porphyridium polysaccharide is a potent antioxidant and effective anti-inflammatory agent that bears a high affinity to skin support and already is in use in nearly 300 cosmetic formulations worldwide. We also plan to investigate its possible capacity for alleviating medical dermal issues, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis in the near future”, concludes Bar-Gil.

Algae-based products are having a moment around the world several companies innovating in this field, especially in the food sector, for instance, Sophie’s Bionutrients, a Singapore-based firm launched its 100% plant-based burger patty developed from single-cell microalgae with more protein than beef or fish.

A new eco-friendly and sustainable algae-based way to fight water pollution,"Using a new strain of algae, scientists have developed an eco-friendly way to purify wastewater. Credit: Shoolini University

Our ever-growing demand for freshwater has caused its sources to diminish rapidly and scientists have been attempting to find strategies to purify wastewater for reuse to meet future demands. At present, the most common wastewater treatment techniques involve the use of chemicals or ultraviolet radiation to kill microorganisms or remove pollutants. But these conventional techniques have several drawbacks, such as the toxic effects of chemical substances on our health or the high energy requirements to run treatment facilities. To create a sustainable system of wastewater treatment, the focus has shifted to eco-friendly and cost-effective technologies.

One such technology under exploration involves using aquatic microorganisms, such as algae, which are known to be able to degrade complex molecules. Recently, a team of scientists from India (Algae Research and Bioenergy Lab, Uttaranchal University; Faculty of Applied Sciences and Biotechnology, Shoolini University; and Department of Biotechnology, Dolphin (P.G.) Institute of Biomedical and Natural Sciences), Korea (Department of Environmental Engineering, The University of Seoul), and Russia (Joint Institute for High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Department of Environmental Monitoring and Forecasting, RUDN University), led by Dr. Pankaj Kumar Chauhan from Shoolini University, India, have developed wastewater treatment technology based on algal bioremediation. Their study is published in Science of the Total Environment.

Algae rapidly cover water bodies with a green film or cause red tides, using the nitrogen, carbon, phosphorous, or heavy metals present in water as nutrition. A high algal load in the water then creates competition for nutrients and sunlight with other microorganisms, causing a reduction in the number of bacteria present in the water. These are some of the properties that make algae promising wastewater purification agents. Added to these, is the fact that they're are eco-friendly, self-sustaining, and cost-effective as a wastewater treatment agent.

Dr. Chauhan explains the basis of the technology developed by his team: ""We selected a novel microalgal strain Pseudochlorella pringsheimii because it can tolerate high pollutant load and can grow over a wide range of temperatures. Moreover, under conditions of stress, Pseudochlorella is known to accumulate high amounts of lipids in their cells, opening up the possibility of using this algal biomass for biofuel synthesis.''

For their experiments, the researchers collected the Pseudochlorella pringsheimii microalgae strain from a natural pond and cultivated it in artificial tanks of raw urban wastewater which contained various heavy metal pollutants and antibiotic resistant bacteria. After 14 days of cultivation, they measured three parameters in these tanks: the water quality, and growth and biochemical composition of P. pringsheimii. They also assessed the possibility of using the microalgae-treated water for fish farming.

The findings of this pilot-scale study were extremely encouraging. P. pringsheimii cultivation significantly improved the water quality by removing heavy metals and harmful microorganisms. Dr. Chauhan explains enthusiastically that ""after the treatment, we observed that the levels of water pollution indicators such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), alkalinity, and hardness reduced by 83.2%, 66.7%, and 69.6%, respectively. Moreover, the algal growth naturally nearly eliminated the total bacteria and coliform in the water. We also saw a significant increase in the lipid content in wastewater-grown algal biomass in comparison to the algae grown in the control medium. This means, that this algae can be recycled for biofuel synthesis.''.

In addition, while no sucker fish survived in raw wastewater, in treated wastewater, 84% of them not only survived but over ten days, their bodyweight also increased by 47%.

This new technology is, thus, a remarkable success in eco-friendly wastewater treatment research and highlights the suitability of using treated water for low-cost fish cultivation. Dr. Chauhan is hopeful that their microalgae-based bioremediation technique will pave the way for a greener and more sustainable future.

Algae’s carbon reduction abilities get additional confirmation,"A new study from Argonne National Laboratory in the US shows that carbon emissions stemming from ethanol production can be used to cultivate algae – which can then be used to create biofuel.

Algae have the potential to produce 10 to 100 times more fuel per acre of land compared to other crops

When most Americans hear the word “biofuel”, corn is likely the first thing that comes to mind. But algae is another viable alternative — if it can be mass produced. Algae species like seaweed and pond scum are capable of photosynthesis, and this process can be harnessed by researchers and used for different applications. As a whole, algae have the potential to produce 10 to 100 times more fuel per acre of land compared to other crops but this requires huge water and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) inputs. These resources are limited in many US regions, making it hard to sustain production. However, the Midwest — which is abundant in high purity CO 2 thanks to corn ethanol production — is an area where algae generation has the potential to bloom.

Fermenting corn yields concentrated CO 2 along with ethanol. Researchers at the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) recently published a study detailing the challenges and opportunities associated with leveraging this CO 2 to grow algae in the Midwest.



This work ultimately shows the potential for growing algae in the Midwest while mitigating emissions from ethanol production. Troy Hawkins, Argonne senior scientist

“This work ultimately shows the potential for growing algae in the Midwest while mitigating emissions from ethanol production. It is a region to consider moving forward for those seeking to commercialise algal carbon capture and utilisation technologies,” Argonne senior scientist Troy Hawkins, a study co-author. Hawkins and his team’s findings reveal that Midwest conditions can support algae growth and that year-round fuel production can be maintained by using other materials, such as wood residue, to generate fuel in the seasons when algae doesn’t grow well. They also found that cultivating algae in this manner can in turn reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from ethanol production by eliminating the need for ethanol producers to capture the carbon made along the way. “Warmer regions like the southern states are usually considered better for growing algae, but many locations have limited access to the water and carbon dioxide needed for algae cultivation,” Hawkins said. “One of the questions we tried to answer in this study is whether the benefit of abundant, high-purity CO 2 and freshwater in the Midwest would offset the less favourable growth conditions in the region.”

Benefits of Midwest production Midwestern states are not generally considered favourable for algae production due to their cold winters. However researchers found that, in warmer months, a Midwest algae pond could cultivate as much algae as southern states but with less water stress. And when concentrated CO 2 from corn ethanol production — versus dilute CO 2 from coal power plants — is used, the process becomes more energy efficient. “Using the concentrated CO 2 from corn fermentation to grow algae has the potential to reduce the carbon intensity of ethanol while producing additional algal biofuel,” Hawkins said. “This is important, as corn fermentation generates a significant amount of CO 2 — very roughly, one-third of the carbon in corn goes into the ethanol, one-third is left in the distiller’s grain, which is used as animal feed, and one-third goes to the atmosphere.” Life cycle analysis detailed impact Researchers arrived at their results after doing a full life cycle analysis of the process for making algae-based biofuel. They relied on Argonne’s Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model, a one-of-a-kind analytical tool that simulates the energy use and emission outputs of various fuel and vehicle combinations.



Researchers arrived at their results after doing a full life cycle analysis

“We used GREET to calculate all of the emissions generated in each step of the biofuel production process,” said Argonne energy systems analyst Longwen Ou, study lead author. “This included working through the details of the emissions from the supply chain and from the electricity used for production.” Argonne and PNNL collaborated on this effort, leveraging modelling capabilities developed at the two laboratories to provide new insights to industry looking to commercialise algae production for biofuels and bioproducts as well as to government agencies involved in setting policies that affect algal biofuel production and decarbonisation measures. PNNL’s Algae Biomass Availability Tool was used to estimate algae productivity.

Sustainable Green Lubricants from Microalgae,"Lubricants are vital for industry as they reduce friction and wear in machine parts. However, their manufacture is currently unsustainable, with research into green alternatives in recent years seeking to address this issue. A paper published in the journal Molecules has explored the production of sustainable lubricants from microalgae.

Lubricants

Lubricants can either be solid, liquid, semi-solid, or gaseous in form. In essence, they form layers between two surfaces to separate them and provide some degree of protection. Using a lubricant facilitates the smooth operation of machinery parts and reduces the risk of failure, whilst also contributing to cost and energy savings. Moreover, lubricant quality is a determining factor in the performance and energy consumption of industrial parts and processes.

The service life of parts and machinery can be significantly improved by the selection of proper lubricants, and studies have demonstrated that reducing friction losses and using advanced lubricants and enhanced technologies can reduce the CO 2 emissions of industrial processes.

However, most lubricants are produced from oil, coal, and natural gas, which presents problems with sustainability and eco-friendliness in their manufacture and use. Increasing costs of crude oil alongside the depletion of natural reserves and the carbon emissions produced during processing have increased interest in renewable, sustainable, non-toxic, and net-zero carbon-emitting green lubricants.

Lubricant Requirements

There are several requirements for a high-performance lubricant, depending on the industrial application. These include high thermal, oxidation, and hydrolytic stability, superior tribological behavior, corrosion inhibition, high boiling point, high viscosity, and a low pour point.

Conventional lubricants are formulated to meet the demands of industry and possess favorable properties. The two common types of lubricants are mineral oils and synthetic oils. Mineral oils are liquid mixtures of hydrocarbons that are obtained via different refining and distillation processes from crude oil, whereas synthetic oils are obtained by chemically modifying crude oil. Synthetic oils possess enhanced chemical and thermal properties compared to mineral oils and therefore are the preferred choice for demanding contemporary applications.

The Environmental Damage Caused by Conventional Lubricants

Despite their superior properties and their essential applications for industry, the production and use of lubricants have been linked with significant environmental damage. Additionally, the production, use, and disposal of these materials can cause harm to the health of individuals handling them. For this reason, several governments have introduced regulations that govern the entire life cycle of lubricants, covering toxicity, safety, handling, and their safe disposal.

According to some sources, 50% of the total lubricants produced and used globally end up in the environment via evaporation and spillages. Formal disposal methods are complicated and challenging, and the production and disposal of lubricants cause greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to anthropogenic climate change.

To address this, green lubricants have been widely proposed, investigated, and developed by scientists across the world. These lubricants have higher biodegradation rates than conventional mineral and synthetic oils and are sourced from biomass such as vegetable oil. Widely explored and promising sources for green lubricants include coconuts, sunflowers, rapeseed, soybeans, castor oil, as well as inedible crops such as neem and Callophyllum innophylum.

The interest in using vegetable oils is attested to by companies such as Total, ExxonMobil, and Dutch Royal Shell producing and marketing bio-lubricants. Despite their eco-friendliness, safety, and non-toxicity, however, the production of green lubricants from vegetable oil is problematic from the standpoint of land and crop usage. One approach which can lessen this impact is to use vegetable oil-based lubricants as additives in conventional lubricants, but this is not an ideal solution.

The Study

An alternative production route for green lubricants has been explored in the new study published in Molecules. Rather than using vegetable oil, which uses up valuable food resources, the team has investigated the use of microalgae biomass to produce ecologically friendly and sustainable bio-lubricants.

As bio-lubricants and biofuels share the same chemical origins (fatty acid esters) existing studies on microalgae-derived biofuels could prove useful for bio-lubricant production. However, as the desired properties for each are different, the research has stated that a variety of chemical treatments are needed to obtain bio-lubricants with the required performance. A second transesterification process or other conversion processes can obtain the required properties.

The review presented in Molecules has four main purposes. Firstly, it reviews and discusses current attempts and progress in technologies for microalgal biorefinery processes and methods of developing bio-lubricants for several industrial processes. Secondly, prospective microalgal strains are identified and examined with respect to their abilities for lipid accumulation, their fatty acid profiles, and their feasibility for industrial-scale production.

Thirdly, the main chemical modifications which enhance the properties of lubricants produced from microalgae are investigated by the authors. Finally, the review has presented a guide for the reader to select appropriate microalgae oils and chemical modifications for further research and development of microalgae bio-lubricants for specific industrial processes. The study makes a significant contribution to the field and can be used as a basis for the future development of sustainable green lubricants.

Dutch company unveils a gold-coloured chlorella to tackle green algae challenge,"Chlorella is a type of algae boasting sustainability credentials and numerous nutrients including vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and omega-3 fats. It’s also claimed to be a rare, plant-based source of B12. But organoleptic challenges have held it back in food formulations. A high chlorophyll content, for example, gives plants a green colour and a bitter taste and smell which have proven a barrier to inclusion in mainstream diets.

Dutch manufacturer Duplaco has now cultivated a new chlorella algae with a natural gold colour. Thanks to special natural cultivation, this hardly contains any colour pigments, the company said, which would otherwise be responsible for the typical green colour of foods to which chlorella has been added.

According to the company, just like the green Chlorella, it contains 40% protein, which includes all nine essential amino acids, as well as an abundance of vitamins and minerals. Duplaco Gold also boasts extra iron and even B12, the company claimed.

""Our innovative cultivation method avoids chemical treatment, which is used by other manufacturers to extract the chlorophyll from the chlorella algae afterwards,""​ explained Duplaco’s founder and CEO Marcel Oogink.

He told FoodNavigator the product is not yet completely tasteless and odourless, but the impact on taste and odour in the end product ‘usually disappears’, as in general only small amounts are used in the formulation of the end product. “Companies are using it for a variety of reasons,”​ he said, “for example to include clean-label B12, or to be able to limit off-flavours from other plant-based protein sources while keeping the protein levels intact. We have also seen a positive impact on gelling and binding, though these functional benefits need to be further investigated. A completely tasteless, odourless and colourless chlorella is under development.”​

He claimed Duplaco Gold has about 0.24 micrograms of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) which makes it an ‘interesting plant-based source of vitamin B12 in plant-based foods and beverages’. He added: “It is furthermore a good source to enrich products with protein, including all essential amino acids, as well as fibers, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, including for example vitamin A, B2, B6, K1, iron and phosphor.”​

Innovative production​

In contrast to manufacturers from Southeast Asia, Duplaco does not produce its chlorella in open cultivation ponds, but rather in a closed fermenter. In doing so, many algae can be grown in a small space, unaffected by sunlight, weather and climate conditions, the company said. It claimed this eliminates impurities and quality fluctuations and saves customers the long transport routes including delivery problems. “Thanks to the closed and controlled system, contamination by heavy metals, disinfectants, like ethylene oxide, dioxins or PAHs can be avoided,”​ said the CEO. “The cultivation is independent of sunlight, weather and climate conditions, therefore guaranteeing consistent quality.”​

Duplaco has recently scaled up its production in Oldenzaal, the Netherlands, from 15 tonnes to 200 to 300 tonnes per year. The aim is to increase this to 1500 tonnes per year in the future. Duplaco also plans on supplying fresh liquid chlorella, which can constitute up to 30% of a meat alternative – and correspondingly boost its protein content.

Founder and CEO Marcel Oogink says Duplaco has managed to breed Chlorella with hardly any colour pigments. Image: Duplaco

The cultivation methodology of Duplaco is a unique and proprietary methodology, ‘easy to scale and easy to automate’, elaborated Oldenzaal. “We ensure ideal circumstances for growth such that the microalgae grows rapidly. The productivity is 100 grams per liter per day, whereas the industry average for heterotrophic cultivation in a closed system is about 20 grams per liter per day, the average for open pond cultivation is 100-200 milligram per liter per day, so compared to open pond cultivation the productivity is about a factor 500-1000 higher.”​

Duplaco Gold was presented to the public for the first time at this year's Anuga trade fair in Cologne. The algae was tucked into the crunchy breadcrumb coating of the vegetable fish nuggets from the Dutch start-up Monkeys by the Sea. ""Duplaco Gold can also subtly enrich pasta, baked goods and meat alternatives,""​ said Oogink. A white Chlorella is already in development, entirely without colour pigments. ""It will be even more suitable for plant-based alternatives to milk, yoghurt and cheese,""​ he added.

The developers at Duplaco said they are also working on chlorella with an even higher content of protein – and on making production even more cost-efficient.",,[],['Oliver Morrison']
Pond Technologies and AB Agri explore algae based methane reduction strategies,"BioCarbN Inc, an environmental infrastructure project developer and operator, and its development partner, Cross River Infrastructure Partners, along with an unidentified agribusiness group are also involved in the research project.

""We are extremely excited to sign this research agreement with BioCarbN, in collaboration with AB Agri and another forward-thinking major agriculture company,""​ said Pond Technologies' CEO, Grant Smith. ""We believe this is just the start in capturing a significant opportunity to help in reducing emissions from cattle globally. The global cattle feed market is over US$75bn annually and this represents another step towards commercializing our algae growth platform into globally important markets, across numerous applications.""​

Carbon capture technology

Located in Markham, Ontario, Pond is focused on controlled environment cultivation of microalgae. Its proprietary patented system is designed to profitably transform CO2 into valuable products. The company grows algae that absorbs greenhouse gas emissions and transforms them into valuable food, feed, and nutraceutical ingredients.

Its platform is based on artificial intelligence, proprietary LED-lights and patented CO2 management. The use of concentrated CO2 from industrial waste streams, it claims, enables it to boost productivity of microalgae well beyond the capacity of outdoor algae growers and allows industrial emitters to abate and ultimately recycle CO2. Its system bolts onto existing industrial facilities.

Pond grows algae in large vessels, which are engineered to automatically regulate the inflow of CO2 or nutrients while reducing the need for manual supervision. ""Our deep expertise in lighting coupled with a series of sensors allow us to optimize growth conditions. After only a few days, the algae are ready for harvest and can then be processed into marketable products, just like any other crop​,” Peter Howard, VP, project development, Pond, told this site previously.

Algae for feed pilot

Pond signed a licensing agreement​​ for its technology with AB Agri’s Livalta last year in relation to setting up a viable operation for algae-based animal feed ingredient production from CO2 emissions in the UK. Livalta and various partners are in the process of installing an algae demonstration system at British Sugar’s Wissington site in Norfolk. A pilot operation will be followed by a commercial-sized plant at the same site producing 20,000 tons of spirulina from CO2 emissions.

The ""landmark""​ commercial partnership gives Pond access to the multi-billion-dollar animal feed market, said Smith last September.

In February, the Canadian firm launched Pond Carbon, a division that will be engaged in the sale and licensing of its proprietary CO2 abatement technology to project developers, engineering companies, funders and other companies in partnership with industrial emitters.",,[],['Jane Byrne']

The biological algal system has been examined and analyzed in the unique study along with other technologies which range from basic chemical-physical adsorption to innovative membranes and ecological approaches.

The Threat of Global Warming

Global warming is a big concern and is considered one of the most serious threats to planet Earth. Between 1900 and 2005, the Earth’s average temperature increased by 0.78 degrees Celsius. CO 2 levels in the atmosphere have grown by almost 25% as a result of unmanaged human activity during the previous 150 years. Between December 2019 and December 2020, there was an almost 2% increase in worldwide energy CO 2 emissions.

Challenges in Carbon Reduction

Within the time scale of climate change, it appears difficult to phase out fossil fuels. Furthermore, there are some sectors where CO 2 output is inevitable, so transitioning to a net-zero environment would necessitate a fundamental redesign in operational optimization.

The globe can only release a specific quantity of CO 2 to keep greenhouse gases below a specified temperature limit, which is known as the carbon budget. At the present level of emission, it will be extremely difficult to keep emission levels within the limit for a 2° C rise in global temperatures.

Carbon Capture and Utilization Techniques

Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) simulations not only reduce the number of air pollutants but also provide a profit by substituting CO 2 for traditional raw materials in many manufacturing applications.

CO 2 use offers tremendous investment prospects in economic expansion, research, and industrialization, and is unquestionably a compelling alternative to Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), providing the requisite financial advantages to participate in such a project.

Importance of Algae

Algae, which are among the simplest and oldest plants found in aquatic environments, are notable for their better growth and carbon absorption capability when contrasted to other plants. Because of their larger capacity to absorb light and convert it to useful energy, algae have a better photosynthesis competence than photosynthetic organisms. Algae may develop quickly and need a concentrated source of CO 2 for photosynthesis due to their high energy conversion. As a result, algae-based CO 2 collection is emerging as a potential option for atmospheric Conversion of CO 2 .

Microalgal cells may also be thought of as cellular sunlight-driven factories able to convert collected CO 2 into fuels, livestock renewable sources, industrial bioproducts, and increased medicinal chemicals.

After absorbing CO 2 from coal burning, these algal solutions are a plus for the power production business.

Carbon Dioxide Capture by Algae

The requirement for chlorophyll and CO 2 is defined simply by the existence and prevalence of photosynthesis in algae species. The objective is to absorb CO 2 and turn it into products with some financial value using the natural photosynthesis process in microalgae.

The procedure consists of mostly two steps. The first is a light-dependent step, while the next is a series of light-independent processes. Light-dependent activities are primarily responsible for supplying the metabolic reducing agent NADPH2 as well as the energy source ATP necessary for inorganic carbon absorption.

In the absence of light, this stage goes through many photosynthetic processes. The major processes here are carbon absorption and photosynthetic activity. The process of CO 2 fixation utilizing NADPH2 and ATP generated in the light-dependent stage is known as carbon assimilation.

Not only has micro-algae been discovered to be successful in carbon sequestration, but the products generated as a result of this capture have substantial economic importance, and the prospect of converting them into more valuable goods makes the notion of using micro-algae for carbon capture even more appealing.

Microalgae create a large number of lipids within their cells, which may then be turned into products such as biofuels, petroleum, and green diesel.

Limitations of the Process

Sunlight is available in practically all parts of the world and at all times of the year. The only issue may be a shortage of sunshine during the evening hours. Artificial lighting, on the other hand, may help to mitigate this challenge at an increased energy raw material price, but it will allow for continuous output.

Future Perspective and Conclusive Statements

Algae Consumption for Carbon capture paves the way for various future industrial processes. As few studies include flue gas from companies, future research should focus on better identifying the implications of commercial flue gas. Second, picking the right algal breed and using the best carbon fixation technology is crucial.

Algae utilization is a very effective technique and has become the center of research all around the world. Its effective utilization shall play a vital role in the reduction of CO 2 concentration and reduce harmful environmental pollutants.

Renewable biomass is one of the key clean energy resources that will help manifest a low-carbon future. However, the process of developing viable and sustainable bio-based fuels, chemicals, and products from biomass suffers from similar limitations to stored produce—they decay and expire.

Lynn Wendt, senior scientist at Idaho National Laboratory, has dedicated much of her research toward addressing biomass decay challenges. She pioneered the development of high-moisture lignocellulosic biomass—like switchgrass, corn stover, and miscanthus—and microalgae storage and handling systems. These systems not only stabilize biomass by delaying its decomposition but also by increasing its value in downstream conversion, making it easier to break down the biomass cell walls.

A loaf of bread, a quart of milk, and a wat of microalgae…will eventually expire

Fuel for the human body is typically grown or raised on the farm or in a garden and then stored, either as a dry good or in a refrigerator or freezer. While it’s stored, food can spoil. The same can be said for the biomass used to develop biofuels and bioproducts. After harvest, biomass is stored until it can be processed and it has a shelf life, subject to the same natural decomposition methods.

Like many of the foods we regularly enjoy, biomass and microalgae are best used when fresh or well preserved. Physiological and physiochemical processes, like internal heat generation and decomposition, degrade bio-based materials after harvest and collection. The root of the problem is microbial respiration occurring within harvested materials, breaking down large molecules which are converted to carbon dioxide and lost to the atmosphere. These processes can rot, or shrink the biomass materials and can even in very rare cases cause spontaneous combustion.

Who wants to live forever? Using science to control rot and decay

Wendt’s course of research and discovery on value-added biomass storage systems began in 2007 as she worked to define an approach to preserve high-moisture corn harvest remnants (e.g., corn stover) from uncontrolled decomposition. These efforts began her quest to understand the critical factors to carbon retention during storage and the use of microbial fermentative byproducts (e.g., CO 2 and methane), anoxic environments (i.e., without oxygen), and other approaches to stabilize biomass storage systems and add value.

The laboratory and field studies that Wendt organized defined both the practical considerations for biomass stabilization1 and the economic2 and environmental value proposition for this approach. It was while researching corn stover that Wendt expanded her research scope to include microalgae. Her goal was to manage its moisture and stability challenges. Microalgae has a high potential to remove atmospheric carbon as well as to be used for biofuels and biproducts development.

Microalgae: Not your average pond scum

The microalgae moisture and stability challenges stem from inherently metabolically active conditions due to the combination of actively growing microalgae cells and the diverse bacterial community associated with outdoor cultivation ponds. If left to their own accord in high moisture environments post-harvest, microalgae can lose nearly half their value in one month. During their research on microalgae, Wendt and her team identified conditions that shifted microbial communities within microalgae storage ecosystems for preservation and production of value-added metabolic products for downstream conversion,3 namely as lactic and succinic acids.

Corn to algae to corn: The path to value-added biomass storage is not linear

Applying lessons learned from her studies on post-harvest microalgae as value-added chemical producers4, Wendt then applied the principle of value-added storage back to corn stover biomass, which ultimately spurred one of her fundamental scientific achievements: developing value-added storage systems for corn stover.

Wendt’s team embarked on a pathway to reduce the barriers responsible for biomass recalcitrance, or the resistance of plant cell walls to breakdown by enzymes and microbes.

Focusing her research at the cellular level, Wendt began by observing the natural biomass recalcitrance within corn stover cell wall layers and tissues. She studied how these factors could be shifted during long-term high moisture storage, causing the plant’s cell wall becomes easier to breakdown. The alkali is sprayed onto freshly harvested corn stover, which is then compacted to remove oxygen and then stored so that alkali reacts with other elements in the corn stover to further breakdown the biomass. The culmination of this work involved detailing the fundamental connections and characterization of alkali-assisted storage to the downstream processing and reactivity of corn stover. Alkali added to the corn stover is a method to remove lignin, a compound in the cell walls of plants that makes them rigid and woody. Facilitating lignin removal during long-term storage and before further downstream processing, offers a more elegant, innovative, and cost-effective biomass feedstock processing method5.

Securing the nation’s supply chains from uncontrolled loss in biomass storage is critical to increased production of decarbonized, sustainable biofuels and products. Through her scientific innovation and team leadership, Wendt is bridging the gap between fundamental and applied sciences and exploring an approach critical for commercialization of sustainable bioenergy.

"Nano/microparticles in conjunction with microalgae extract as novel insecticides against Mealworm beetles, Tenebrio molitor","In recent years, the use of common fumigants and insecticides to control stored pests in the grain has led to insect resistance22. At the same time, these insecticides are also toxic to animals that are fed with grain23. Insecticide residues are then transferred to the animals and then to humans, so an alternative strategy to protect stored grains needs to be found. Nanotechnology and nanoparticles are now entering the field of agricultural biotechnology24,25. Slowed agrochemical release kinetics and reduced application volume are the main advantages of nanoparticles26. Recently, there has been growing interest in research into NPs and NPs as potential insecticides. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been tested against insect pests from different order like as Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, Diptera, such as silver (Ag), gold (Au), aluminum (Al), silica (Si), and zinc (Zn) and metal oxide, zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO 2 )22,27,28,29,30,31,32,33.

To determine the size and shape of the nanoparticles, SEM was used. Figure 1 shows that the average diameter of nanoparticles in solution after sonication was larger than that stated by the manufacturers. The microscope images indicated that the morphology of the particles was spherical in shape and consisted of aggregates several micrometres in diameter, as seen in the images (Fig. 1A,B,C). The SEM micrographs of Ag NPs showed that aggregates consist of fine structured particles of various sizes. This was also confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. The same results were obtained using Zn nanoparticles and SiO 2 nanoparticles. The obtained results show their differential distribution profiles, which are consistent with the SEM results (Fig. 1D). The size of particles using DLS analysis showed an average size of 530 nm for Ag NPs and 777 nm for SiO 2 MPs and ZnO MPs (2355 nm). Additionally, the surface charge and colloidal stability of the used nanoparticles were determined by analysis of the zeta potential. Nanoparticles dispersed in water showed zeta potentials of −24.2 mV, −30.2, and −28.7 mV for Ag NPs, SiO 2 MPs, and ZnO MPs, respectively. These values are slightly below the threshold of -30 mV, which is considered the minimum zeta potential for electrostatically stabilized suspensions34.

This study was devoted to investigating the effect of NPs/MPs alone and NPs/MPs with algae extract on the viability of the sixteenth larval stage of T. molitor and to examining their insecticidal effect. The efficiency of selected nano/microparticles (ZnO MPs, SiO 2 MPs and Ag NPs) against T. molitor was tested at concentrations of 2 g/L, 1 g/L, and 0.5 g/L and is presented in Fig. 2. Mortality was monitored for five days, and the results were collected every 24 h. Selected concentrations of NPs/MPs were selected based on preliminary experiments.

Figure 2 Mortality of Tenebrio molitor larvae after using pure 2 g/L ZnO MPs, 1 g/L SiO 2 MPs and 0.5 g/L Ag NPs and these MPs/NPs in combination with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii extract. (A) Number of dead larvae for 5 days. Three spray treatments: 0, 48 h, 96 h. 150 mealworms were used per treatment. (B) Percent of total mortality after 120 h. Mortality was measured by the Henderson-Tilton formula20. Full size image

Our results indicate that C. reinhardtii extract had a negligible activity when tested alone (14%), while an increase in mortality was observed following treatment with ZnO MPs in water and when mixed with algae extract. The ZnO MP-treated larval mortality was 33%, while the mortality when mixed with C. reinhardtii was 66%. Recent investigations of C. reinhardtii have shown its antioxidant activity and antibacterial potential against different strains16. Such activity is assumed to be related to its major extracellular metabolites.

Indeed, 1-nonadecene, 1-octadecene, 1-tetradecene, and diisooctyl phthalate have been shown to exert insecticidal or antibacterial activity across several species35. Although the mechanism of the C. reinhardtii extract was not addressed in detail here, the increased larvicidal activity of nanoparticles when mixed with its extract might be derived from the actions of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds and flavonoids16,36. Previous studies on the antimicrobial activity of ZnO nanoparticles hypothesized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the surface of ZnO NPs triggered irreversible damage to the microbial cell wall. Together with active molecules from algae extract can result in compromised cellular integrity and eventual pathogen death.

From Fig. 2, differences were obvious between different nanoparticle treatments; however, this was expected because the effect of NPs/MPs appears more complex when linked with factors such as composition, shape, size, and surface-to-volume ratio37. Different mechanisms of nanoparticle action may be a main reason for the observed difference in activities. In our experiment, silver nanoparticles were the most effective against mealworms. The larval effect of the 0.5 g/L Ag NPs on the larvae was confirmed compared to the untreated control. It is still unclear what makes Ag NPs less effective when they are combined with algae extract. One of the hypothesis could be the fact—that metabolites from the algae extract have bound to the surface of the NPs and thus inactivated the activity of the silver NPs. However, this statement needs to be investigated in more detail in a further experiment. Silver has been employed commonly as a component of many plant antimicrobial formulations.

The toxic nature of silver ions is well known, and one of the possible mechanisms that has been reported relies on the ability of silver ions to bind to cysteine-containing proteins, causing pathogen membrane disruption38.

Many studies have described the insecticidal effect of silica nanoparticles31,39,40,41. The reported underlying mode of action is through desiccation of the insect cuticle after nanoparticle absorption to the cuticular lipid and disruption of the structures42. The exposure of T. molitor larvae to silica microparticles inflicted a mortality rate of approximately 71% and resulted in a darker cuticle of dead larvae. We confirmed the hypothesis that SiO 2 NPs damage epidermal and dermal cells, which leads to dehydration of the larval body, making them look dark39. This morphological alteration in the presence of silica MPs coincided with the declines in cell viability43 and may be, thus, assumed to be associated with larval death by desiccation.

Table 1 shows the statistical analysis of T. molitor mortality expressed as the mean ± SD with Tukey HSD inference. All treatments were compared with a control sample (treated with water). The sample treated with 0.1% Silwet Star surfactant was insignificant. Pure C. reinhardtii extract showed statistical significance (*p < 0.05). Other samples showed a significant difference (** p < 0.01) compared with that of the control sample.

Table 1 Statistical analysis of T. molitor mortality expressed as the mean ± SD with Tukey HSD inference. Full size table

Similarly, compared to their bulk materials, silicon, titanium dioxide, copper, alumina, zinc, and silver nanoparticles have emerged as potential candidates for combating different agricultural pests, improving plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses, and enhancing plant growth performance44,45,46. Additionally, there may be numerous mechanisms of nanoparticle toxicity toward insect pests. Certain nanoparticles can penetrate and accumulate in the cell membrane, which is likely to cause cell lysis, while others may stimulate the generation of cellular ROS, leading to loss of cellular function and cell death47,48.

The accumulation of ZnO MPs and Ag NPs was estimated by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). For technical reasons, we could not measure the accumulation (content) of silicon in the bodies of T. molitor larvae. The zinc and silver concentrations in live and dead larvae (Table 2) were expressed in units of mg/kg. The zinc content was determined in all tested larvae (Table 2). However, in larvae treated with ZnO MPs, a higher zinc concentration was observed compared to that of larvae not treated with ZnO MPs. The highest values of zinc (268.01 ± 9.20) were measured in dead larvae sprayed with a solution of ZnO MPs at 2 g/L with algal extract and in live larval bodies (225.41 ± 6.20) sprayed with the same solution. The increase in zinc concentration in both dead/live larvae reveals that these MPs were able cross larval cuticles when mixed with the algae extract. The water-sprayed control sample contained significantly p < 0.001 less 48.02 ± 4.60 Zn in live larvae; in contrast, 70.00 ± 9.60 mg/kg zinc was measured in dead larvae.

Table 2 The total content of Zn and Ag ions in bodies of live and dead larvae measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) with flame atomization and with air-acetylene flame and using ultrasensitive hollow cathode lamp as the radiation Full size table

All arthropod groups contained high concentrations of zinc, iron, manganese and other microelements and heavy metals in their bodies. These metals are found as part of the cuticular components of the body49,50,51. Zinc is an essential component of more than 300 enzymes and transcription factors. In addition to the cuticular part of the body and the enzyme complex, zinc also plays a role in DNA synthesis and is essential for the proper physiological functioning of insects, and it is also found in the area surrounding the midgut (including Malpigh tubules) in pupae and adults52,53. To maintain homeostasis and reduce toxicity, the content of micronutrients is regulated. The rate of zinc excretion does not exceed the rate of accumulation until it is near toxic levels, and thus more zinc accumulates than necessary. Mir et al.54 studied the accumulation of zinc in the whole body of the Bombyx mori insect, which was fed a leaf treated with ZnO NPs. During their experiment, they found that zinc had accumulated in the body for 6 h, after which time its levels began to decline.

Table 2 also shows the total content of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). Silver was detected only in the larvae that were subjected to Ag NPs with or without algae extract. The highest content of Ag NPs was measured in the dead body of mealworms treated with Ag NPs and algal extract (16.54 ± 6.90 mg/kg). In contrast, the lowest measured silver content (6.02 ± 4.30) was recorded in the bodies of live larvae treated with pure Ag NPs. Similar values were measured in the live body of mealworms (12.24 ± 5.90) treated with Ag NPs and C. reinhardtii extract and dead larvae treated with pure Ag NPs (12.89 ± 4.80). Silver was not detectable in the other samples because silver is not an essential micronutrient in living organisms. Although silver, which is not part of cells and tissue, has good antimicrobial effects and insecticidal effects that induce cytotoxicity, increase ROS production, and lead to DNA damage and apoptosis55,56. Ionic silver strongly interacts with thiol groups and deactivates vital enzymes57,58. At present, relatively high attention has been given to silver nanoparticles. Various studies have shown that Ag NPs are able to distribute and accumulate in certain organs of the body after exposure59,60. Silver nanoparticles have effects on the development and growth of larvae, the duration of larval and pupal stages and the viability of adults. It was found that the amount of Ag NPs increased in Drosophila melanogaster as the dose of exposure increased, and insects were able to accumulate silver in the tissue for a long time even when the organisms were not exposed. Further studies have also found that Ag NPs accumulate in the body after application, lead to demelanization of the body and have an insecticidal effect on the model organism D. melanogaster61.",,[],"['Rankic', 'Department Of Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Faculty Of Agrisciences', 'Mendel University In Brno', 'Brno', 'Czech Republic', 'Central European Institute Of Technology', 'Brno University Of Technology', 'Zelinka']"
The Use of Biomass Within the Circular Bioeconomy,"In a recent editorial article published in the journal Frontiers in Energy Research, researchers presented the framework of a circular economy based on biofuels and bioproducts.

Circular Bioeconomy

The world's high energy demand is primarily based on the production and consumption of fossil fuels. This has resulted in severe environmental consequences that include pollution, climate change, and the high emission of greenhouse gases (GHG).

While different renewable energy sources can fulfill the energy demands, they rely on climatic conditions that are difficult to control and unpredictable. In comparison, biomass is considered one of the prospective solutions to resolve the challenges developed by renewable energy and fossil fuels.

In the fossil-based economy (FBE), fossil fuels fulfill the majority of the energy demands, whereas in the circular bioeconomy (CBE), the majority of the energy demands are fulfilled by biomass. The main advantage of CBE is that it is a sustainable approach and reduces the environmental issues caused by FBE.

The conversion of FBE into a CBE is aided by biomass as a feedstock to produce valuable chemicals and biofuels. CBE requires the development of efficient resource strategies and sustainable green technologies, and its main aim is to support the value of a product and reduce waste, GHG emissions, and ecosystem damage. CBE is based on procedures that are the foundation of a carbon-zero society and primarily comprises biomass carbon, with economic, social, and environmental factors as key drivers.

In the present study, the researchers have presented various strategies to convert biomass in biofuels and bioenergy within the CBE framework.

CBE Frameworks and Strategies

The first step of CBE development is to match the international supply and demand of energy using biomass production, sustainable process developments, and reutilization strategies. It must be noted that sustainable process development must include detailed life cycle analysis and techno-economic studies. Additionally, the CBE economy must also be focused on greenhouse gas repurposing strategies and bioenergy production using biofuel.

Agricultural wastes are considered a challenge that causes environmental issues in the traditional FBE. A study included by the researchers proposed using coconut juice residues as a feedstock to make bacterial cellulose, which could further be acetylated to make bio-cellulose acetate membranes.

These membranes could additionally be used to remove CO 2 from biogas produced by the anaerobic digestion of biowaste, which will finally produce renewable biomethane. The produced CO 2 could be used for processes such as syngas production, chemical separation, and microalgae cultivation which is essential for CBE.

Use of biomass within the circular bioeconomy concept.

Furthermore, it will also lead to developing a value chain that is expected to improve the CBE. Overall, the agricultural residues could be used to make high-value products for biogas purification in energy production, resulting in a zero-waste environment.

A common practice used for reducing agricultural waste is crop residue burning, but this procedure is the root cause of air pollution, GHG emission, and radiation imbalance. Moreover, it also causes significant health risks and is responsible for declining organic matter in the soil. Another study referred by the researchers aims to shift crop residue management (CRM) from traditional methods to a CBE framework.

This shift will ensure the long-term viability of the agroecosystem. Additionally, the CRM bioeconomy is built on four pillars: smart agriculture practices, waste bioeconomy, stakeholder capacity building, and proactive government policy. Furthermore, the proposed bioeconomy crop residue management approach will contribute to sustainable development by providing substitutes to minimize crop residue burning and improve farmers' livelihoods.

Another strategy to develop CBE is to use lipase for biodiesel production. Several studies have demonstrated that lipase can be selectively catalyzed to convert bio-oils to biodiesel. However, the production of lipase-based biodiesel is heavily dependent on the ability of enzymes to be reused multiple times without significant loss of activity. One method to overcome the limitation is immobilization through adsorption-crosslinking to improve lipase reusability.

This process will reduce the dependency on the FBE and support shifting towards the CBE, as diesel and petrol production are the primary drivers of FBE.

Conclusions

To conclude, it is critical to adapt CBE frameworks at the earliest to meet future food, animal feed, and energy requirements. The main bottlenecks in developing CBE concepts are resources, information, and research. Furthermore, additional knowledge is required to fulfill bioenergy, biomass, and biofuels supply and demand. In addition to this, social participation is also essential to improve the CBE strategies and frameworks. It is also critical that the governments proactively develop policies to strengthen the CBE frameworks and research.

Duplaco ramps up chlorella production as antidote to Asian red tape and costs,"The Oldenzaal-based firm are expected to expand production from 15 tons to 200 to 300 tons per year with plans to eventually produce 1500 tons per year in the future, according to Engineer and Founder of Duplaco, Marcel Oogink.

“We currently see a strong increase in interest from the supplement and health nutrition industry,”​ he goes on. “Companies are looking for an alternative to Asian supply as the prices of container shipments from South East Asia have increased 10-fold. ​

“We furthermore understand that many companies are facing issues with the reliability of supplies, fluctuating qualities, contaminations, and more, like for example the latest issue with ethylene-oxide. ​

“We can offer our customers a reliable supply of stable, high quality products, reliable documentation and less transport costs.”​

Founded in 2012, Duplaco, short for Dutch Plankton Company, are now looking to provide a solution to the algae originating from open cultivation ponds in Southeast Asia.

According to the firm, these ponds are characterised by impurities, supply problems and quality fluctuations. In addition, the long transport routes are anything but sustainable.

Self-developed chlorella process​

Duplaco produces its Chlorella via a self-developed process in which the microalgae are “fed” with a carbon source and grown in a sterile fermenter.

The closed system ensures there is no contamination by heavy metals, dioxins or PAHs and the cultivation is independent of sunlight, weather and climate conditions.

The approach ensures that higher volumes of Chlorella can be produced with a small footprint with the harvested Chlorella spray dried and pressed into tablets upon request.

Duplaco are due to appear at this year’s Vitafoods in Geneva on 4 – 8 October, where they will be discussing these tablets, made with 100% Chlorella without any form of coating and additive-free.

“It is very expensive to have green tablets made as manufacturers/contractors primarily make white tablets to avoid the green powder entering their factory,”​ explains Oogink.

“This is to reduce the need for costly cleaning efforts before they can continue the production of white tablets. We take on this hurdle ourselves, making it appealing for customers.”​

Customers and clients include supplement manufacturers that refer to the microalgae’s cultivation within the EU as a selling point.

These manufacturers are also drawn to the microalgae’s 40% protein content and 40 different vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and essential amino acid that a more health-conscious, sustainability-aware audience can no longer ignore.

Special Vitafoods promo​

“Within the industry we see a growing interest in our Chlorella as a source of plant-based protein mainly as a potential solution to optimise the sustainability profile of products while at the same time improving the taste,”​ says Oogink.

“We developed a Chlorella with very limited levels of chlorophyll, resulting in a yellow gold coloured Chlorella with only a small hint of green. The nutritional profile is similar, except of course for e.g. the chlorophyll levels. ​

“The yellow-gold version has a very neutral taste, which makes it easy to blend into many different kinds of products without a negative impact on the taste profile. Some customers may prefer our Chlorella with chlorophyll and some without.”​

Oogink adds that the firm are having a special Vitafoods promo, where customers who order a minimum of 250kg before November 30, 2021, will get 50kg for free for sampling purposes.

The details of this promo and more information about Duplaco can be downloaded from their website.

“Companies interested in our powder or fresh Chlorella are of course also very welcome to visit our stand and to check out the opportunities of Dutch Duplaco Chlorella for their company,“ ​he adds.",,[],[]
Alternative Food Startups Thriving in Singapore: Eating Smart,"Food security has been a top priority for many countries in recent years. But for Singapore, ensuring a resilient food supply has always been an obstacle. The island nation has long relied on imports to meet its dietary needs, though if trade were ever to fail, a country seen as one of the most food-secure in the world would struggle to feed even a tenth of its population. This dilemma has paved the way for alternative food startups to thrive in Singapore.

With their ’30 by 30’ target, Singapore aims to produce 30% of their food supply locally and sustainably by 2030. However, with its limited land and resources, Singapore has turned to agritech and alternative foods to meet its goals. Take a look at how these sustainable startups are spearheading the alternative food industry in Singapore, and strengthening food security through innovation.

Edible insects

We get it, bugs aren’t exactly everyone’s cup of tea. But loaded with proteins, fats, minerals and fibre, these little critters are proven superfoods.

Insect farming requires far less feed, water and land compared to livestock farming and produces as little as 1% of the greenhouse gases caused by beef production. So, why don’t we see insects as a practical source of protein like meat, fish or dairy? Is it really just the ‘ew’ factor?

Asia Insect Farm Solutions hopes to challenge these perceptions by making sustainable insect-based food solutions accessible. From cricket flour to chocolate chip cookies, the company is one of several startups leading the change towards sustainable protein. Fellow alternative food startup, Altimate Nutrition, combines cricket powder with crowd-pleasers like chocolate, peanut butter and matcha to create alternative protein bars that are nutritious, sustainable and ethically sourced from cricket farms.

Cell-based food

As the first and only country in the world to approve the sale of cultured meat, Singapore has set a new precedent for the food industry. San Francisco company Eat Just’s GOOD Meat Cultured Chicken made its historic debut at restaurant 1880 in Singapore with the two-dish combo of crispy maple chicken and waffles, and a sesame chicken ‘bao’.

Singaporean startups have yet to produce cultured protein for commercial sale themselves. But several are well on their way to making cell-based food convenient and affordable.

Shiok Meats uses cellular agriculture technology to grow cultured seafood. The women-led team hopes that their ethical approach to seafood will help to restore transparency to the industry. Cell-based seafood could tackle issues like overfishing, seafood fraud and forced labor fishing in the long-term. Currently in the research and development stage, Shiok Meats plans to launch their alternative products in 2023.

However, it’s not just animal products that are getting the cultured treatment, but their byproducts as well. Offering a sustainable solution to meet dairy demands, Singapore-based company TurtleTree Labs is the first in the world to produce cell-based milk.

According to the startup, plant-based milk alternatives like soy, oat, almond and coconut milk have different compositions to dairy milk. This means that their ability to create other dairy products like butter, cheese and yoghurt is limited. Using their technology, TurtleTree Labs aims to produce quality milk from mammals that retains its functionality. Consequently, it would also mitigate the pitfalls of the dairy industry like animal cruelty and greenhouse gas emissions.

Microalgae protein

With potential uses in renewable energy and biopharmaceuticals, microalgae hold major opportunities not just for the food industry but for a more sustainable future as a whole. These photosynthetic organisms are one of the richest sources of plant-based protein in the world and with a higher growth efficiency compared to conventional crops, they have the capacity to meet the dietary needs of our growing population.

Using local food waste from breweries, tofu factories and sugar refineries, alternative food startup Sophie’s Bionutrients are growing microalgae in bio-reactors. With their technology, they’ve been able to produce a range of microalgae food products. These include plant-based meat, microalgae flour and even dairy-free microalgae milk.

Agritech startup Life3 Biotech has also been working on optimizing the cultivation process of various strains of microalgae to achieve a higher yield. The company plans to formulate new microalgae foods and incorporate microalgae into its existing products to boost its nutritional value.

Pond Technologies Applauds Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report Indicating Urgent Need for Deployment of all Greenhouse Gas Reduction Technologies,"The IPCC Report Urges Rapid Action on Climate Change, Providing Further Opportunity for Pond's Carbon Capture and Utilization Systems to be Deployed

MARKHAM, ON / ACCESSWIRE / March 9, 2022 / Pond Technologies Holdings Inc. (""Pond"") (TSX.V:POND); (OTCQB:PNDHF); (FSE:4O0), an ESG company addressing global sustainability challenges of wellness and climate change, applauds the recently released report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the ""IPCC"") entitled ""Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"" (The Working Group II contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report) and believes the report's conclusion underscores the need for rapid deployment of carbon capture and utilization technologies globally.

The report assesses the impacts of climate change, looking at ecosystems, biodiversity, and human communities at global and regional levels. It also reviews vulnerabilities and the capacities and limits of the natural world and human societies to adapt to climate change. According to the report, the cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health. IPCC stated that there is need for global action on reducing climate-change inducing greenhouse gas emissions which will result in missing a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for humanity.

Pond Carbon, a subsidiary of Pond, is in active discussions with companies globally to commercialize its carbon capture and utilization technology that grows a sustainable, economically valuable biproduct in algae.

Grant Smith, President & CEO at Pond said: ""The IPCC is the leading international body that compiles the scientific consensus on climate change. This report is clear, and points to the need for rapid deployment of carbon-reducing technologies like Pond's. We believe that deploying our technology as part of a response to climate change is not only the right thing to do, but it will help companies transform their emissions into valuable commodity replacements. The need for carbon reducing technologies reflects the strong and growing demand for Pond systems globally.""

Spirulina: Pharma’s Market Ally,"With more and more technological development in the fields of bio energy, pharmaceuticals and researchers of the nutrient world have been looking more into one particular microalgae: spirulina. Meticulous Research and the European Algae Biomass Association (EABA) recently launched a report at the end of June in which they concluded that the microalgae market is expected to reach USD $1.8 billion of worth by 2028. But what, exactly, are they looking into and why is it so promising?

Microalgae, or microphytes, are microscopic algae that are found in freshwater and in marine ecosystems. They vary in shape and size according to the species, ranging from micrometers to hundreds of micrometers. Microalgae has one main goal: to convert sunlight, CO2 and water into algae biomass. Spirulina is a natural, unbranched, filamentous blue-green algae, or cyanobacterium, that is high in protein. It’s packed with essential amino acids, iron, minerals, nutrients, carotenoids, and is a good source of antioxidants and B vitamins. These features justify why spirulina is often recommended to vegetarians and make it an ideal supplement during pregnancy, after surgery, or whenever the immune system needs a boost.

Although spirulina has been around since ancient times, its nutritional values and health benefits have not yet been scientifically proven. However, recent studies have shed a light on the microalgae’s health benefits and have developed technology to retrieve the best features of the cyanobacterium to complement and create holistic medicines. Studies by the Pukyong National University in the Republic of Korea have found that spirulina possess the ability to act upon several bioactivities, and has proven to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, anticancer, antiobesity, antidiabetic, antiviral, antibacterial, and anti hepatopathy properties. According to NB Entrepreneurs, leading manufacturers and producers of Excipient Solutions and top provider of pharmaceutical industry, it can “improve lipid and glucose metabolism, while also reducing liver fat and protecting the heart. Animal studies are very promising as well, as spirulina has been shown to be of similar potency as commonly used reference drugs, when it comes to neurological disorders. These effects also extend to arthritis and immunology”

The Meticulous Research and EABA’s report published a few weeks ago explain why, now of all times, spirulina and other microalgae are expected to grow in market size in the next 8 years. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, food and beverage manufacturers witnessed a decline in sales: with lockdowns in place throughout the world and government policy and recommendations to only buy the essentials, the F&B industry took a hit. With it, so did microalgae.

The decline in consumption of microalgae and algal biomass was because there were now many obstacles on the supply chain. From cultivation, to production, packaging and distribution, there were less employees at hand and less people to buy. China is one of the world’s leaders in consumption and production of microalgae. However, in 2020, “factory closures, microalgae processing facilities operating at reduced capacities, and restrictions on importing and exporting algae biomass strongly impacted the microalgae market”, according to the report. Moreover, the pandemic also affected the microalgae market in many countries around the world, like the US and India. With a nationwide lockdown in place in India, many commercial microalgae production and processing facilities shut down or are operating at reduced capacities, leading to substantial losses in domestic microalgal production.

However, the current pandemic has also acted as a big wakeup call to the world in regards to overall health, and the pharmaceutical industry has taken notice. A strong immune system has become a priority for many people, and a good nutrition intake is key in achieving that. The Meticulous Research and EABA’s report concluded that in order to maintain an optimal immune system, there is now a growing demand for plant and algae protein food products & beverages through e-commerce platforms. The Davis School of Medicine at the University of California, found that spirulina “inhibits influenza virus replication and reduces virus-induced mortality, and the addition of spirulina to cultured immune system cells significantly increased the production of infection-fighting cytokines” as well as that spirulina “modulates the production of cytokines and with its bioactive proteins stimulates the intestinal immune system to enhance the responsiveness to vaccines and improve allergic rhinitis due to its rich content of flavonoids and sulfalipids”

The report’s findings also concluded that the interest in microalgae, and spirulina in particular, has more chances to grow into the pharmaceutical industry. Health trends in 2021 showed a spike in interest towards natural food coloring, veganism and vegetarianism and unpleasantness towards processed foods, synthetic flavor and colors. Being a naturally bright and colorful superfood, spirulina has caught the eye and heart of consumers worldwide and is estimated to account for the largest share of the overall microalgae market in 2021 owing to the rising health & wellness trends and dietary supplements industry.",,[],[]
The Next Big Step for Algae and Sustainable Aviation Fuels : Biofuels Digest,"By Dr. Rebecca White, Dr. Lieve Laurens, Nate Kommers, Algae Biomass Organization

Special to The Digest

Among the dozens of policy innovations that Congress must consider in climate change legislation is a tool that could help trigger the next stage in decarbonizing one of the most significant industries in the world: aviation.

The provision is a tax credit that would give producers of sustainable aviation fuels, known as SAFs, a level playing field when it comes to competing with traditional fuels. It would mark a new era in a long effort to address the 2% of all greenhouse gases that come from aviation, and become a gateway to building a sustainable fuel infrastructure that works with the world’s existing fleets. SAFs take advantage of a variety of sustainable fuel feedstocks such as waste oil, tallow, agricultural crops, or microorganisms like yeasts and algae.

SAFs are proven to work, but have also been held back

The technical principles to make these fuels have been around for almost as long as the technologies that have made electric cars, or wind and solar energy successful. Yet despite a long list of advantages that include lower carbon intensities, lower particulate levels and even better performance potentials, SAFs make up less than 1% of aviation fuel used today. So, what’s holding things back?

It doesn’t seem to be a lack of vocal support. The global aviation industry has announced a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050. President Biden has pledged to produce 3 billion gallons[1] of sustainable fuel and reduce aviation emissions by 20% by the year 2030. And U.S. airlines have backed up those impressive commitments with support of their own, adopting targets for sustainable aviation fuels across the board, and operating flights with SAFs[2].

It isn’t a technology problem either, as a dedicated community of engineers and scientists have refined SAF production in countless ways. Most SAFs are made with biomass, often crops like soy or microorganisms like yeasts or algae. For each of these there has been ample success. Just last fall, Honeywell announced[3] that its refining process was used to successfully supply commercial flights with SAFs derived from microalgae.

In fact, the story of algae-based SAFs offers an interesting case study in the kind of obstacles that have delayed the decarbonization of aviation. A decade ago, there was a frenzy of interest in algae for fuel that stirred up investments and lofty promises by a number of startups – all based on very exciting, but also preliminary, technical analysis of how efficiently algae could be used to turn sunlight, water and fertilizer into fuel. Unfortunately, those promises gave way to delays, then frustration, and finally outright skepticism on whether the fuels would ever work.

Yet over the past ten years the algae industry has quietly been overcoming the hurdles. There has been no single breakthrough to make headlines. Instead, dozens of new innovations across the board have improved efficiencies, streamlined processing, and boosted production possibilities.

This iterative technical progress is showing real results. As part of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s DISCOVR R&D consortium, the cost estimates of producing one ton of algae have been brought down to approximately $600 per ton when viewed on an nth-plant commercial-scale basis[4]. Global Algae Innovations, a company that been part of some of the leading collaborative research efforts, estimates production costs of approximately $800 per ton[5]. These figures are several times better than what was possible 10 years ago.

To put it another way: If algae can be scaled-up to commercial production costs in this range, it would translate into an aviation fuel price approaching economic viability, while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions. That is more than enough incentive to compete with petroleum fuels, especially when paired with existing policy support or consideration of coproduct opportunities, as well as commitments from the international community to decarbonize aviation.

One of the more significant impediments to SAFs is supplying the needed volumes of the fuels to make a difference in the annual blending capacity. This has been a major hurdle associated with novel and innovative SAF production routes. While many pathways are approved and recognized as qualifying as sustainable[6] for the production of renewable fuel, the scalability of the feedstocks to reach the needed targets of national scale fuel output (i.e. 35 billions of gallons of SAF by 2050[7]) often does not present a feasible output.

The emergence of algae as a highly productive innovative agricultural crop offers an opportunity of scalability and carbon efficiency that is poised to make a dent. On the basis of productivity, the current achieved yields from open, large-scale, algae ponds are at least three-fold higher than terrestrial crops, producing approximately 30 tons per acre of algal biomass, while corn typically yields approximately 7-8 tons per acre. Microalgae can take you from soy’s minimal yield of <0.4 tons per acre of SAF precursors to 10 tons or more, requiring orders of magnitude less of a land footprint. This is a great outcome for greenhouse gas impacts!

Additionally, algae biomass is well-suited to be processed in existing refining infrastructure. Algae biomass comprises, conservatively, about one fifth fatty acids and derivative oils, whose molecular composition directly or combined with other feedstocks is ideally suited to enter into an existing refinery’s hydrotreater, and produce blend-ready SAF following a hydrotreated esters and fatty acid (HEFA) pathway that has been ASTM certified (D7566). Algae oils are generally ideally positioned to contribute to a HEFA-SAF thanks to an attractive carbon chain length profile. However, to make a substantial contribution to SAFs, the algae oil content in algae biomass would need to exceed the currently demonstrated levels in large-scale cultivation systems.

Beyond pure yield, the biomass composition of algae feedstocks, with over 50% of its weight as carbon, becomes an attractive feedstock for the production of fatty acid and ethanol-derived SAFs. The high carbon content is often leveraged as an effective carbon capture strategy. The biomass elemental composition translates to approximately two tons of CO 2 that are stored for every one ton of biomass produced, which is more efficient than the just , such as possible future producers tax credits, would significantly reduce the cost-burden and stimulate the needed large scale biorefinery deployments.

Based on a recent resource and sustainability assessment of nation-wide algae production potential[8], projections estimate that over 20 billion gallons of SAFs could be produced across a collection of >1,000 large algae farms, considering highly productive agricultural deployment across non-arable land. Even modest 100 acre farms are able to present opportunities for e.g. 3,000 tons of biomass, or the equivalent of over 120,000 gallons (or 3,000 barrels) of SAF, sustainably and photosynthetically produced. This clearly indicates the significant potential for algae to contribute to the nationwide quest for SAFs, and provides support for deployment of algae technologies. Additionally, recent waste water treatment reports calculates that with available waste water resources it is possible to achieve 4-6 million tons of algae biomass per year, equivalent to 300-500 million gallons of SAF[9],

Existing national-scale policy credits, such as the RIN credits under the Renewable Fuels Standard, can be used to support the necessary rapid expansion of deployment of algae-based technologies. Current legislation includes an up to $3/GGE credit if the renewable liquid SAF can be produced with an at least 50% reduction in GHG emissions relative to its petroleum-derived SAF counterparts[10]. The D5 RINs are already accessible for photosynthetically produced fatty acids from algae. Not only does fatty acid-derived SAF qualify for RIN credits, the ASTM Aviation Fuel Standard has long specified and approved bioderived components, such as fatty acids (in a HEFA pathway) from feedstocks including photosynthetic and other algae[11].

The next stage of SAFs

So why hasn’t the support and technical progress translated into more sustainable skies? It comes down to one final hurdle: scale.

Current SAF production facilities are tiny compared to the economies of scale available to fossil fuels. Unless we can achieve meaningful production, the goals so many have set for a low carbon aviation industry will be impossible to meet.

There are some signs of serious investments being made in SAF production. Neste, a global leader in biofuel production, recently announced a new capacity of up to half a million tons of sustainable aviation fuels[12]. This is equivalent to about 165 million gallons. Some estimates indicate that from a feedstock perspective, there is enough raw material to fuel all of aviation by 2030, but production is held back by the scale of new technologies and plants that can run on less constrained feedstocks[13]. And if we look at the number of SAF production plants around the globe that have been announced or that are already in production we can see production approaching 3.5 million metric tons by 2025[14]. That’s equivalent to more than a billion gallons, but still only halfway to the Biden administration’s goals for the United States alone by 2030. We are going in the right direction, but we need to pick up the pace.

Every viable feedstock will need more physical infrastructure that can transform biomass into SAFs. These are capital heavy endeavors, and many of them may take a long time for a meaningful ROI to materialize. This is why the tax credit that had been included in the Build Back Better legislation, and other policy supports targeting commercial production, is so important.

A SAF tax credit will give a sense of stability to producers and investors, making it much easier to commit to building large-scale facilities. Today we see a marketplace filled with electric cars, renewable electricity, and low-carbon liquid fuels for cars and trucks that was turbocharged when similar tax credits provided the lubricant these technologies needed to show capital markets that they can be viable alternatives.

Tax policy doesn’t have to act alone, either. Other effective programs include public-private partnerships that can demonstrate large scale production, essentially proving to potential investors what models will work.

If we give SAFs the boost they need we will be overcoming the final barrier that so many new technologies face at this stage of development between proving viability and getting to a scale that can properly enter the market.

In the case of SAFs, getting from proving technical viability to true commercial scale will likely have compounding benefits. A larger base of global algae production will give this relatively new feedstock a chance to succeed in other markets that can benefit from low-carbon feedstocks: more sustainable food production, biomaterials that can replace petroleum-based plastics or chemicals, and services such as water treatment.

The commitment we need today from policy leaders is one that aims SAFs toward commercial scale. It will be followed by a remarkable transition to cleaner skies, a new sector of economic growth, and a message to every other industry wrestling with decarbonization: It can be done.

Algae the key as KAUST seaweed biotech aims to boost Kingdom’s fisheries,"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology is working on expanding Saudi Arabia’s seaweed and algae stocks to boost the Kingdom’s fisheries industry.

The postgraduate research and teaching facility, located 100 km north of Jeddah, is developing projects to feed into the Kingdom’s goal of attracting over $4 billion (SR15 billion) of foreign and local investment into Saudi Arabia’s fishing industry, as part of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 scheme to diversify the economy.

Claudio Grünewald, a microalgae expert and a project director with KAUST, told Arab News: “We are on a mission to establish algae and seaweed biotechnology in the Kingdom.”

What use do slimy green plants play in the development of a multibillion-dollar industry?

Grünewald said: “Algae and seaweed are widely used in pharma products, cosmetics, fertilizers and food for both animals and humans. For example, in the gel used for canning meat and in the natural coloring of energy drinks. We all consume seaweed and algae-based ingredients every day, but hardly anybody is aware of that.”

The value of global algae and seaweed production stood at around $40 billion in 2020, with anticipated growth of 9.6 percent between 2021 and 2027, according to research firm Global Market Insights

A leading producer in this area is China, but Grünewald believes Saudi Arabia could catch up with and even become the market leader within the next five years. KAUST is carrying out academic research for the private sector to make that happen.

“The Kingdom has plenty of sun, flatland and clean seawater,” Grünewald added, “all of which are the essential factors for the production of marine plants.”

He noted there is little human impact on the Red Sea in terms of sewage and heavy construction, compared to the Mediterranean.

But this raises the question. If the Kingdom’s development of its Red Sea coast brings large numbers of tourists, will this not undermine the pristine quality of its seawater and potential for growing marine stocks?

Grünewald noted: “Tourist development can be done sustainably. For example, wastewater can be used to supply the nutrients necessary to produce algae.

“Similarly, date farming produces a lot of sugar in its waste materials, which are a potential organic carbon and energy source for the production of algae. All of this will contribute to a circular economy.”

KAUST is working with the private sector to turn its research into commercial ventures.

“We have strategic partnership with various companies”, Grünewald added, “for example Naqua (Saudi Arabia’s National Aquaculture Group). And we’re talking to other stakeholders such as the plastics industry, the electricity industry and thermal power plants.”

All these stakeholders will be needed to establish a sustainable marine farming sector in the Kingdom using local materials, resources and workers. KAUST is training young Saudis in seafood farming, from bachelor to postgraduate level, while also hiring locally — 50 percent of the staff across its marine farming projects are Saudi, with women making up half of this figure.

“KAUST is also incubating startup companies”, Grünewald added. “In fact, the Beacon Development Company (a Saudi consultancy providing specialist advice in environment, marine and food projects) began as a startup and is now a KAUST department with 150 staff.”

He said: “We have a mandate from the government to diversify the economy by 2030. In terms of food security, the Kingdom cannot rely on imports.

“We need to produce our own raw materials and do our own processing and adding of value. And this must be sustainable and with high impact social welfare. I think Saudi Arabia can be a leader in algae technology and aquaculture by the end of this decade.”",,[],"['George Charles Darley', 'Arab News', 'Hala Hisham Koura Nirmal Narayanan']"
Plenty and Driscoll's to build vertical farm for strawberry production,"US vertical farming startup Plenty and berry grower Driscoll’s plan to build a new indoor farm completely dedicated to strawberry production.

The announcement comes a little over a year after the pair first announced their intention to grow crops using a combination of the Plenty’s controlled environment ag (CEA) tech and Driscoll’s proprietary genetics for strawberries.

Plenty competitor Bowery Farming has also announced the launch of its strawberry “duo-pack” into select retailers. The pack will feature two different strawberry varieties, both grown in Bowery’s indoor vertical farm.

The announcements underscore the likelihood that strawberries are the next big crop for vertical farming – and that there will be intense competition for market share as companies inch towards commercial-level production.

On background:

New York’s Bowery has had plans to sell strawberries for some time and last month acquired robotics startup Traptic, which makes robots for harvesting delicate crops. At the time, Bowery said the acquisition would accelerate commercialization of its fruiting and vine crops, calling out strawberries specifically.

The company’s strawberry duo-pack will be available at selected retailers and restaurants in New York City for a limited time.

Plenty’s planned strawberry production facility will be the first commercial-scale farm it builds outside of its home state of California – though the exact location has not yet been revealed. The company says strawberries grown there will serve consumers in the Northeastern US.

Earlier this year, Plenty raised $400 million in funding. The Series E round was the largest fundraise to date for a vertical farming company, and followed Plenty’s $140 million Series D round in October 2020, which was co-led by Driscoll’s.

In a statement, Driscoll’s chairman and CEO J Miles Reiter spoke of Plenty’s “technological leadership in indoor vertical farming” as a reason the berry-maker chose this partnership.

Why it matters:

Plenty and Bowery both excel at farming systems — that is, the hardware and software needed to grow mass amounts of produce inside. Crop breeding and genetics are traditionally more the territory of a long-established grower like Driscoll’s, which has decades of know-how around optimizing berries for growing environments. Whether this proves an advantage to Plenty in the race to commercialize vertically-grown strawberries remains to be seen; Bowery earmarked a portion of its then record-breaking $300 million Series C for crop variety R&D. CEO Irving Fain told AFN that the company has a “world-class research and development team on the agricultural sciences side.”

Commercializing crops beyond leafy greens is critical to vertical farming’s long-term success. Many have suggested controlled environment agriculture (CEA) is headed for the “trough of disillusionment.” One of the big reasons for this is that despite lofty promises of being the future of food, indoor farming has yet to deliver on growing heartier crops at a scale that would make a positive impact in feeding a growing global population.

Fain is optimistic that CEA “has a real place in the produce conversation now in a way it didn’t have a few years ago” and that while it might be an inflection point, “that’s a net positive for the industry overall,” he told AFN recently.

Given that strawberries routinely top the Environmental Working Group’s “dirty dozen” list, strawberry production is a natural next step for the entire industry.

Other companies, including Singrow, Amplified Ag, and Infarm, have said they are also working on strawberries, while New York-based Oishii already sells the high-end Omakase strawberry grown on its vertical farm [disclosure: AFN‘s parent company, AgFunder, is an investor in Singrow.]",,[],[]
CIBO & Bushel partner to make carbon farming profitable for US growers,"Carbon farming firm CIBO Technologies recently announced its first CIBO Carbon Bridge partnership with grain trading platform Bushel.

The CIBO Carbon Bridge program launched earlier this year and mitigates risks for US growers switching to regenerative agriculture practices. Bushel will provide digital infrastructure that can streamline and speed up the process of joining a carbon program for farmers.

How it works:

Carbon Bridge is a pay-for-practice program that incentivizes farmers to transition to regenerative farming practices to sequester carbon. The program emphasizes that farmers get paid quickly for making this switch.

Qualifying farmers commit to a minimum four-year agreement and must maintain a reduced tillage practice at all times such as strip or no-till.

Currently, the Carbon Bridge Program is limited to corn and soybean crops.

Farmers get paid from the first year. Payments can reach up to $35/acre. CIBO’s VP of Development Nitzan Haklai tells AFN that the company offers “the most competitive payments and also the most simplified way to get them.”

Over a roughly four-year period, the size of the payments goes down as farmers start to see increased yields, reduced input costs, and the creation of carbon credits they can sell.

Leveraging Bushel’s “digital infrastructure”:

Bushel’s software platform currently powers around 2,000 grain facilities across North America.

The company acquired farm-management app FarmLogs in 2021. The latter’s technology allows different systems in the grain handling chain to “talk” to one another. FarmLogs connects the farm gate to the grain facility and down to customers by integrating accounting systems, trading desks, farm management systems, and market feeds.

Existing FarmLogs customers can now opt into CIBO’s Carbon Bridge Program thanks to the CIBO-Bushel partnership.

Bushel’s director of Farm Success Kellie Livernois tells AFN that FarmLogs makes adopting regenerative practices faster and simpler by providing streamlined data on field boundaries, weather information, fieldwork, and planting dates, to name a few areas.

The partnership will also make enrollment faster for farmers interested in joining a carbon program. “The connection there is just being able to share records digitally or via API to a CIBO,” she says. “You can calculate the profit and loss and report to the FSA and track their marketing position. Not having to go double enter [the data] adds a lot more value to the picture.”

Both Livernois and Haklai stress that Bushel isn’t starting a carbon program itself, and that CIBO is still the one paying the farmers. Bushel, according to Livernois, wants to be “the digital infrastructure in this pipeline of sustainability.”

Why it matters:

Carbon Bridge is designed to help growers manage the risks associated with transitioning to regen ag, which can include new equipment and labor costs, as well as costs associated with implementing new practices such as no-till and cover cropping. It can take farmers years to see any financial gains from switching to these methods.

Historically, these risks have deterred farmers from adopting regen ag.

However, the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is the highest its been in 4 million years, and carbon sequestration is increasingly seen as a “must-have” for the ag industry rather than an add-on for those that can afford it.

Getting farmers paid quickly for their practices is crucial to getting more of them to make the switch. Haklai says the role of technology is to help create carbon programs that can do this at scale.

The Bushel partnership is CIBO’s first big one for the Carbon Bridge program, though certainly not the last. Haklai says the company is currently working to create more programs in the future with other sponsors “from across the value chain.” Programs for commodity crops other than soy and corn are a possibility for the future, too.",,[],[]
Chipotle's new $50m fund is looking for early-stage startups to help it grow,"US fast-food chain Chipotle has launched Cultivate Next, a venture fund that will invest in early-stage startups developing food and restaurant tech that lines up with the company’s own growth goals.

Cultivate Next, run by Chipotle chief technology officer Curt Garner, will invest in startups at seed to Series B stages with solutions that can improve employee and guest experiences. The fund’s initial size is $50 million and financed solely by Chipotle.

On background:

The launch of Cultivate Next comes after several years of Chipotle testing and implementing numerous restaurant tech initiatives across its business:

Why it matters:

According to the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call, Chipotle plans to grow to 7,000 restaurant units over the long term and will invest in the kinds of innovations that can foster such growth. This is where the Cultivate Next fund comes into play.

“We are looking to make investments that will increase guest access to Chipotle as well as elevate the human experience for our teams,” Garner told AFN over email. He adds that this could be “anything from innovations in farming and supply chain, to advanced robotics, and beyond, as long as it helps further our mission to cultivate a better world.”

Chipotle has not yet provided more specifics about the types of companies it will look for beyond them being early stage. The fund is currently accepting companies on a rolling basis.

Garner adds that Chipotle is “open to growing the fund” beyond its initial $50 million and has the option to accept outside capital.

Bigger picture:

Cultivate Next launches as the restaurant industry continues its long, slow recovery from Covid-19 while facing rising inflation, and higher food and labor costs overall. The latest report from the US-based National Restaurant Association predicts food, labor, and occupancy costs will “remain elevated, and continue to impact restaurant profit margins in 2022.” This will put even more pressure on businesses large and small to find ways to slash margins and increase efficiencies from the front of house to the back.

Even more recently, foodservice-focused research firm Technomic flatly stated, “Make no mistake: 2022 is all about labor, supply disruption, and inflation.” However, Technomic noted in the same blog post that “while these issues will continue making headlines across global markets, they will also spur lasting innovations that will ultimately put foodservice back on the path to long-term prosperity.”",,[],[]
"Biogas, fertiliser, & algae from pigs: the company putting circular farming in practice","Cooperl, one of the world’s largest pig producers, is creating biogas, biofertiliser, and algal feed from animal waste. Here’s how it’s putting circular farming in action.

Cooperl is a circular agricultural pig farming cooperative based in Brittany, France. Founded in 1966 by 24 pig producers, it now has a turnover of €2 billion a year and 7, 200 employees. Around 2, 700 pig producers are members and most are small family farms averaging 200 sows.

Like other circular enterprises, Cooperl’s driving objective is to profit from zero waste farming. As far as possible, outputs from every process are reprocessed and used as inputs for another. This means that pigs are only one aspect of their business: the cooperative also makes high-value products from agricultural waste, turning nitrogen and phosphorus recovered from manure into mineral fertiliser and farming waste into biogas.

Cooperatives are voluntary, joint-ownership organisations whose members work towards shared commercial objectives. Although similar to producer organisations, they do not have to meet certain legal conditions to qualify. The cooperative structure supports businesses that would otherwise be disadvantaged against bigger market players. The Cooperl cooperative is divided into 9 geographical areas in France, each with its own technical team of breeding technicians, building technicians and vets to facilitate easy-access services for its producer members.

The idea of agricultural cooperatives might evoke images of bucolic nostalgia, but Cooperl upends this stereotype. One benefit of a cooperative is that it can pool its resources to develop and deploy new tech. Cooperl’s R&D specialism is in technologies that help accelerate their circular mission. In this area, it holds 10 patents and has its own R&D department stocked with agro-engineers, veterinarians, mechanics, and electronic engineers. They also own an experimental farm where they test their innovations under realistic field conditions. Cooperl is not only the largest pork processing company in France and among the largest in the world but it is also leading the way in high-tech and sustainable agriculture.

Initiatives like Cooperl will be essential in making the green transition. Last year, Ramón Armengol of the European General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives stated that farming cooperatives are especially good at adding value to waste. This activity can feed into “energy, manufacturing, and technological and digital systems.” In a similar vein, the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) stated that “[Co-operatives] have significantly innovated in the fields of sustainability, circular economy, pesticide reduction, risk management of natural and man-made disasters.”

Such rhetoric is common in the SDG sphere, but Cooperl is living up to these vaunted claims. Its bioenergy project shows that its circular framing operations already hold economic ramifications beyond agriculture. In 2019, Cooperl opened Europe’s largest non-spreading methaniser, Émeraude Bio-énergie, to process pig manure from 100 of their farms. Twenty-five percent of the input into the digester is pig manure while 40 percent is wastewater from the Cooperl slaughterhouse. The rest is water that is recycled from plant processes or pig urine.

The first step in making biogas is collecting feedstock. This is done using the Trac system, a technology designed by Cooperl and rolled out 12 years ago. The system is a pig house installation that immediately separates urine and manure as it falls to the floor. Liquid waste is washed along a gentle slope while solid waste is mechanically scraped outside the barn. Air ventilation wicks away odours from the air. Around 100 pig farms belonging to the cooperative had installed Trac, collecting around 34, 000 tonnes of solid manure. By moving waste outside the pig houses, it reduces concentrated ammonia emissions. One family farm in Brittany said that installing the system allows them to meet European regulations on gas emissions. The farms sell their waste at around €20 per tonne. The income means Trac installation costs can be paid off in around 11 years.

The plant produces 7.5 million metres cubed of biogas a year by using microorganisms to break down the waste matter in the absence of oxygen. Once the carbon dioxide is removed from the organic substance, it becomes biomethane. This is then fed into a gas distribution network, providing 60 million kilowatt hours per year equivalent to the energy needs of 10, 000 homes. The energy is used by consumers in Lambelle and the surrounding area.

Biogas is the most valuable product that can be made from pig manure but Cooperl’s methaniser also creates biofertilisers using a nutrient-rich by-product called digestate. The plant makes 80, 000 – 100, 000 tonnes of pelleted biofertiliser a year. Cooperl is currently planning to open a second digester to boost fertiliser production.

Cooperl’s biofertiliser is in demand throughout the year. However, some parts of Europe have a bio-nutrient surplus due to strict EU directives limiting fertiliser application. As a result, Cooperl is redirecting some of their 156, 000 tonnes of raw biogas digestate per year into alternative animal feed. As a partner on the €6.5 million ALG-AD project, it is helping conduct R&D into algae-based feed. Cooperl is culturing microalgae on nutrients recovered from the manure biogas plant. Microalgae are among the few organisms that can metabolise these byproducts.

Cost-efficient algal animal feed will be an important boost to the circular bioeconomy. European livestock farmers currently depend on soybean imports from South America. Not only do the long-haul flights rack up carbon emissions, but the soybean industry is also responsible for deforestation on a massive scale. Algae on the other hand require comparatively few acres and do not compete with human food sources. However, sustainable methods of scaled production remain in the experimental stages. Its growing and processing tend to be more carbon-intensive than importing soybean. Trials like Cooperls’ are essential in finding energy-efficient ways of producing feed-grade algae.

Cooperl also sells equipment and services to farms in England, Russia, Vietnam, China, and the Ivory Coast. In fact, 36 percent of Cooperl’s turnover comes from exports. It has particularly strong ties to Russia. In December 2009, they signed an agreement to establish a joint centre for pig breeding and selection with a group of Russian companies based in St Petersburg. Cooperl also has a presence in Henan, China, where demand for pig meat is growing. The farm there was designed by Cooperl with a post-weaning unit and insemination centre. It comes complete with the TRAC system that feeds into a local biogas plant.

Cooperl is proof of how a fully circular operation that invests in innovative R&D need not be at odds with production and profit. Cooperl’s success in transforming farming byproducts into high-value goods indicates just how much wastage – of value and resources – is involved in a standard agricultural operation. Yet, as its farms around the globe show, there is nothing preventing the model from being replicated more widely.

Increasingly, farmers’ know-how in scaled biomass cultivation will offer value well beyond food provision. Agricultural expertise, particularly when allied to the latest circular techniques, will become essential in manufacturing bio-based alternatives to petroleum-derived materials and energy. Organic waste from animal rearing will provide free feedstock for bio-based resources. Cooperl’s ability to squeeze value from every part of their farming operations is an important model for reforming our farming system and integrating it into other critical sectors of the economy such as energy.",,[],[]
Seaweed farming offers a boost for Sri Lanka’s ‘blue economy’ ambitions,"Seaweed farming is an increasingly important part of the global food system and provides a range of benefits, including sustainable coastal livelihoods and economic diversification, food production, export revenue, climate change mitigation and adaptation, pollution control, and organic fertilizer.

Sri Lanka used to have a prominent seaweed market in the 1930s, but today there’s only limited, small-scale seaweed farming in the country, mostly without processing or value addition.

With greater investments of money, technology, and know-how, Sri Lanka could offer the perfect location to cultivate seaweed either on its own or as integrated mariculture, for example with shrimps, mollusks, or sea cucumbers, experts say.

Farming seaweed in Sri Lanka could be a viable and highly beneficial part of expanding the blue economy if initial challenges are overcome and coastal communities engaged with support, guidance, technology, and quality control, experts say.

COLOMBO — In its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone, Sri Lanka is home to an abundance of coastal and marine resources. And while national policies and development visions already aim toward a blue economy, much of this natural wealth is currently not being used in a sustainable way or to its full potential, experts say.

“Coastal fishing communities are vulnerable,” says Ruchira Cumaranatunga, a senior professor in the Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture at the University of Ruhuna. “There is a need to create or enhance alternative livelihoods in coastal areas of Sri Lanka. While helping coastal fishermen to sustain their fishery activities, they should be provided with additional sources of income. The best method for this would be to promote small- and medium-sized enterprises based on fish processing, utilization of fishery waste or trash fish, and seaweed farming. Women and school dropouts in fisher families could be involved in these SMEs.”

The benefits of seaweed

Seaweed farming in particular offers a pathway for developing the blue economy and creating sustainable livelihoods, proponents say. Globally, seaweed aquaculture is one of the fastest-growing components of food production, with 99% of production taking place in Asia. If the sector is scaled up further, it could generate 500 million metric tons dry weight by 2050 and completely replace fishmeal and fish oil in animal feed, provide protein for humans, and save vast amounts of land and freshwater. There are many other ways in which seaweed is beneficial for humans, the environment, and the climate.

The commercially valuable types of seaweeds are species of algae that generally fall into three groups: green algae (Chlorophyta spp.), red algae (Rhodophyta spp,), and brown algae (Phaeophyta spp.). The different species of seaweed have many uses, and farming them has a small environmental footprint, as they do not significantly alter the existing coastal environment or require fertilizer input, freshwater resources, or medicines.

“Seaweed species like Ulva lactuca [sea lettuce], Caulerpa racemosa, or Caulerpa lentillifera [sea grapes] are popular delicacies,” says Isuru U. Kariyawasam, a lecturer in the Department of Botany of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. “In addition, chemicals extracted from seaweeds can be widely used as nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, UV blockers, anti-cancer compounds, and many other applications.”

Dilanthi Koralagama, a senior lecturer at the University of Ruhuna, says seaweed farming could provide inputs for the organic fertilizer industry as well. “As some seaweeds and microalgae contain comparatively high percentages of nitrogen,” she says, “issues related to nitrogen content in organic manure can be solved up to an extent, which is not possible using terrestrial flora and fodder alone.”

Seaweed can be grown rapidly and vertically, which makes efficient use of available water space and provides an opportunity to diversify the coastal blue economy. However, providing a sustainable source of income and employment for coastal communities is only one of the many benefits and opportunities that seaweed could provide.

“Seaweed farming can provide alternative livelihoods,” says Sarath Jayanatha, research officer at the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA). “Income generation is a major output of seaweed farming, but if it can be initiated on larger scales, seaweed could also be important to mitigate climate change.”

Seaweed is highly versatile and useful when it comes to addressing the causes and impacts of climate change. On one hand, seaweed stores carbon dioxide, and can be used for biofuel generation, replacing inorganic fertilizer, or lowering methane emissions as cattle feed. On the other hand, seaweed is an effective adaptation tool that can reduce wave energy and protect shorelines, improve water quality, and alleviate the local effects of ocean acidification and oxygen loss.

Furthermore, seaweed can be used to clean up pollution in the marine and coastal environment by removing agricultural nutrient pollution. Such pollution is difficult to remove once it has entered the water, and seaweed is one of the few effective methods to address it.

Seaweed farming in Sri Lanka

“Currently, seaweed farming is only done on a small scale in Sri Lanka,” Cumaranatunga says. “The seaweed is dried and exported without any value addition. Sri Lanka has a lot of living and non-living resources in the coastal belt, but at the moment, they are extracted and sold to other countries. Value addition within Sri Lanka could be a hugely important topic.”

Sri Lanka’s coastline abounds with seaweed species and habitats, for example along the southwest coast from Ambalangoda to Galle, or along the northern coastline near Jaffna, Palk Strait, and the Gulf of Mannar.

“Seaweed farming or cultivation is a cheap, low-technology practice that requires little input and has been practiced in many Asian countries for decades or centuries,” Kariyawasam says. “However, in Sri Lanka, it is still in its infancy. We have many sheltered bays, lagoons and estuaries that could be used, but so far, no large-scale attempts have been made to establish seaweed mariculture in the country.”

If such large-scale attempts would be made and seaweed farming enhanced alongside the coastal sector and its blue economy, Kariyawasam says, it opens up a future of many possibilities: “Integrated Multitrophic Mariculture (IMM) systems are a very effective and sustainable method to culture seaweeds. Seaweed could be farmed in polycultures with shrimps and molluscs and even help to address problems of aquatic pollution and effluent water treatment for existing shrimp farms. Seaweed mariculture could also be integrated with sea cucumber farming to open up novel avenues for sustainable mariculture systems.”

Koralagama highlights the economic potential: “Some seaweed species provide edible protein and are recommended as a dietary supplement. Growing such seaweeds for export could bring foreign exchange into the country, as there is already a well-established market in developing countries.”

Challenges and perspectives for Sri Lanka

Given all these benefits and applications, what is the potential for seaweed farming in Sri Lanka? If it is indeed a viable source of livelihoods that offers a range of co-benefits, why has it not been adopted at a larger scale yet?

Jayanatha from NARA says many companies are trying to get subsidies through seaweed projects. “Therefore, many of these companies are not willing to invest their own money,” he adds.

“It is important to note that seaweed farming requires sufficient capital and proper technical know-how to be set up,” Koralagama says. “Therefore, support from the private sector is essential to scale up the seaweed industry in Sri Lanka.”

Even with financial support, however, there are still barriers and challenges that have to be overcome, Kariyawasam said. “Some of the constraints to build a strong seaweed industry in Sri Lanka are lack of awareness and knowledge, lack of technology dissemination, lack of seed stocks, personal attitudes and lack of motivation among fishing communities, environmental fluctuations, and the short, seasonal lifecycles of certain seaweed species. Sri Lanka had a solid seaweed market in the 1930s, but it was lost due to adulterations done by our people. Therefore, it is very important to make high export-quality stocks when improving the seaweed industry in Sri Lanka.”

The scope to expand seaweed aquaculture is also limited by the availability of suitable areas, competition for these areas with other uses, the availability of engineering systems capable of coping with rough sea conditions, and market demand for seaweed products.

As the world increasingly becomes aware of the potential of a sustainable blue economy, investing in seaweed could provide many benefits for Sri Lanka, the experts say. In addition to providing a relatively cheap and low-technology option for economic diversification of coastal communities, they point out, seaweed farming also offers a range of use cases as well as serious co-benefits related to climate change mitigation, resilience, environmental protection, and pollution cleanup.

UPSIDE Foods bags $400m in cultivated meat's largest funding to date,"Why it matters:

UPSIDE’s mega-funding round comes atop a long list of milestones the company has hit over the last year. These include opening an engineering, production, and innovation center in California, developing an animal-free cell feed, and acquiring cultivated seafood company Cultured Decadence. UPSIDE also announced a partnership with Michelin-starred chef Dominique Crenn to sell its cultivated chicken product at her San Francisco restaurant Atelier Crenn.

Getting regulatory approval to actually sell its products remains the one not-so-small step UPSIDE must complete before any commercial sale can happen.

Currently, Eat Just is the only company in the world to have gained regulatory approval to sell cultivated meat, and that’s only in Singapore. Plenty of other companies discuss regulatory approval and commercialization, though none have yet come forward with a concrete timeline.

UPSIDE originally marked 2021 as its year for commercialization; the company is now eyeing later in 2022 as a new target, “pending regulatory review,” but has not yet given a country or region where that might happen.",,[],[]
"NRDC: Federal policy ""must invest"" in regen ag as a climate solution","“We must reverse agriculture’s trajectory. Policy shaped our current situation, and policy can change it.”

So says a new report from US-based nonprofit the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) that examines the role regenerative agriculture can play in transitioning the wider US agricultural sector into a climate solution rather than a major contributor to climate threats.

To make that a reality, federal policy “must invest in regenerative agriculture, diversify food systems infrastructure, support farmers and ranchers, and fund regenerative research and extension,” the report continues.

Currently the agricultural sector is trapped in something of a vicious cycle: farmers are often first to feel the impacts of climate change in the form of extreme temperatures, fires, floods, droughts, and other issues. Yet industrial agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, accounting for about 10.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the US.

Industrial ag by the numbers

NRDC interviewed more than 100 US farmers for the report and surfaced the following findings about the current state of industrial agriculture in the US:

Just four agribusinesses control most of the seeds and fertilizers farmers can purchase.

Only four companies control more than 80% of the country’s beef processing, 70% of the country’s pork processing, and 60% of sheep and lamb processing

Four companies control more than half of the US poultry market, and these companies also dictate “how farmers must raise their animals, which stifles innovation.”

How regen ag can help

Broadly speaking, regenerative agriculture is “a land management philosophy whereby farmers and ranchers grow food and fiber in harmony with nature and their communities,” according to NRDC.

NRDC’s report makes a point of noting that there is no one-size-fits all definition of regen ag, and that current definitions “do not embody the way farmers and ranchers described regenerative agriculture to us.”

That said, some common aspects of regenerative agriculture include prioritizing soil health via cover cropping, crop rotation, no-till farming, and other practices; reducing reliance on fossil-fuel inputs; nurturing relationships within a farming ecosystem; and nurturing the surrounding communities and their economies.

Key policy recommendations

Transitioning away from industrial farming’s “get big or get out” mentality will require substantial change at the federal policy level. NRDC’s policy recommendations tackle four key areas:

Level the federal investment playing field and incentivize regenerative stewardship. That means reforming the policies that made industrial agriculture what it is today. Some of NRDC’s recommendations include reforming the federal crop insurance program, creating more risk management options to deal with loss and disaster, increasing baseline funding for farm bill conservation programs and increasing support for the conservation reserve program.

Invest in more decentralized and diverse food systems infrastructure. Policy must help to build infrastructure that creates more opportunity for regenerative growers, such as more local, dedicated food production or regenerative meat processing facilities.

Support regenerative farmers and ranchers. It’s no small feat to transition to regen ag. Policy needs to support farmers and ranchers financially during their early years of transitioning. In particular, we need more support for BIPOC growers to access federal programs and more support for socially disadvantaged and beginner farmers.

Fund regenerative agriculture research and extension. Technical resources offered by public research institutions need to improve to meet the needs of regenerative farmers, and there must be “consistent, stable, and adequate funding” for conservation districts so that they can supply more technical support to growers.

Needless to say, reversing the trends that turned agriculture into what it is today will take years, and require major shifts for policy, public dollars, and consumer buying choices alike. As NRDC concludes, “This report’s policy recommendations are only the beginning of the transition.”",,[],[]
Urban agriculture advisory committee established by USDA,"The US Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, has named 12 members to the US Department of Agriculture‘s (USDA) inaugural Federal Advisory Committee for Urban Agriculture.

The committee will “provide input on policy development and to help identify barriers to urban agriculture,” a USDA statement said.

“Urban agriculture has been growing in impact and importance, and we are taking bold actions to build a support structure [which] will complement our efforts focusing on equity, local food systems, access to safe and nutritional food, and new ways to address climate change,” Vilsack said.

Why it matters:

While the USDA is typically associated with the nation’s traditional ag sector, the creation of the urban agriculture committee suggests that it’s increasingly seeking engagement with emergent forms of agrifood production – such as tech-enabled greenhouses and vertical farms.

As an indication of this, several representatives from the agrifoodtech scene are among those selected by Vilsack to sit on the committee – such as Viraj Puri, co-founder and CEO of greenhouse operator Gotham Greens; and Kaben Smallwood, co-founder and CEO of aquaponics provider and consultancy Symbiotic Aquaponic.

Future Crops CEO Gary Grinspan makes case for soil-based vertical ag,"Future Crops isn’t your typical vertical farming startup.

For one thing, the Israel-founded, Netherlands-based company uses a proprietary soil-based substrate in its indoor setups, as opposed to the more widely recognized ‘soilless’ systems on the market.

Second, it’s backed by Chinese internet behemoth Tencent – not generally known as an agtech investor.

What’s more: The initial concept behind Future Crops came from the need to reconcile Jewish dietary practices with more sustainable methods of food production.

Today, it operates an 8,000 square meter indoor vertical farm just outside The Hague, primarily run on solar power and currently focused on producing high-value herbs and microgreens.

AFN recently interviewed co-founder and CEO Gary Grinspan (GG) about the company’s kosher roots, its journey from the Middle East to Northern Europe, and why he thinks there’s still very much a place for soil in indoor farming.

AFN: How did you and your co-founders initially come up with the idea for Future Crops and why did you decide to launch the company?

GG: The original idea started in Israel because of kosher limitations. Fresh produce would be considered to be kosher if you couldn’t find, at a microscopic level, any bugs and insects.

With the pressure to reduce the use of pesticide, this becomes a very challenging task. A few years ago, we started to look at ways to grow crops in the most clean way, totally free of pesticides. This would also fit very much the increasing trend for healthier lifestyles as people deserve to know what they eat, and with fresh produce you never really knew how much pesticide was on the product.

We started to develop the technology in Israel with the partnership of the Vulcani Institute (ARO), one of the most prestigious research centers for agriculture, and after three years of research we decided to build our first, large-scale and mass-production vertical farm in the Netherlands.

AFN: Who does Future Crops consider to be its closest competitors – and how does it differentiate itself from them?

GG: We have competition from two angles.

First it is with conventional agriculture, mainly glasshouses, focusing on local or imported products. Usually with this kind of agriculture, vertical farming offers a superior product in almost all aspects, but prices are more expensive. The more we develop our technology, the more we are able to reduce prices to align with market prices.

The second angle would be all other companies that develop vertical farming technology. With that perspective, only a few succeed to prove mass-scale production capabilities. This is important as plants in small-scale R&D units behave very differently in comparison to mass production units. Future Crops is one of the few that has a proven mass-scale production unit. What makes our technology very different is the fact it is soil-based, which allows us in many cases to have better quality, taste, and flavor profile, as well as increased shelf life – but also many other benefits related to the business’s viability.

AFN: What more can you tell us about Future Crops’ soil-based substrate – and how is it, in your words, “as close as possible to nature”?

GG: Mother Nature teaches us that most plants need soil to grow. We didn’t want to change her rule, but rather stick with it using technology to enhance the final output. Soil is the natural environment that plants and roots need to grow ideally, and this makes our process closer to nature.

AFN: But one of the arguments in favor of soil-free vertical farming is that it may reduce costs and risks associated with having soil in the system – for example, the presence of certain pathogens, or having to clean produce before it is sent to market. What’s your response to this?

GG: Using soil substrate-based technology is indeed more complex and adds more operational challenges as compared to hydroponics systems. This is exactly the expertise we have developed.

But when is comes to food security and safety, or risk factors, in many aspects soil-based systems are more stable than hydroponics systems. First because the soil is playing as a buffer for the plants if something goes wrong during the process, like with irrigation or other [operational tasks].

Furthermore, the way we have built our technology allows us to grow in small batches which helps us control much better the growing cycle of plants. Finally, related to cleaning, we have no issues as the harvesting is performed just above the soil; therefore, our produce is completely clean, without the need to wash it.

AFN: Beyond the soil-based substrate, what are the other tech elements of Future Crops’ system?

GG: Once we decided to go with the soil-based system, all the technology related to vertical farming needs to be adapted to the platform, including automation, irrigation, lighting, HVAC [heating, ventilation, and air conditioning] and more. Our processes are fully automated from seedling to harvesting and this requires a high level of technology expertise and complex integration.

Tencent, others plow $15 million-plus into ag automator FJ Dynamics – read more here

But at the heart of our intellectual property lays our algorithms, or recipes, which also here are fully adapted to our soil-based system. We control more than 70 different parameters to grow ideal plants. This is a complex equation [which] we need to optimize to achieve maximum yield at minimum costs and maximum quality.

For the last five years we have invested many resources to achieve the level required for mass-scale production and there is still a lot to do to continuously improve these algorithms. We are also using specific sensors and data science to help us with this. Furthermore, we own a proprietary license on specific seeds that have been proven suitable for vertical and fully controlled farming.

AFN: Does Future Crops intend to operate its own farms, or to provide its tech and solutions to other farm operators? Or both?

GG: Future Crops offers two business models: sell directly our produce to customers, or build partnerships with strategic customers [providing an] ‘ag-as-a-service’ platform – meaning, building and operating vertical farms for strategic partners.

We already market our produce to leading retailers throughout Europe and we are in discussions with potential partners to build and operate farms in other regions.

So far, most of our sales have been through the retailers or wholesaler channels.

AFN: Why do you think Tencent decided to invest in Future Crops? Are there particular synergies with its business(es)? And what strategic support might Tencent be able to provide the company?

GG: I think that today, it’s becoming more and more clear that countries and organizations are looking for solutions for domestic food supply, guaranteed all year round, [and to] increase food security standards, especially with Covid-19 in the background. This is a global trend. Furthermore, sustainability ventures that aim to create a positive impact on our planet and our lives become an imperative, and world-corporates like Tencent and others, have identified this trend and understand the urgency to take a leading role in changing the food system.

Tencent is a strategic investor for Future Crops and can add great value to our business [because of] its technological expertise in automation, AI, machine learning, and other areas; and its very wide network of connections to tech and other companies [which can help us] to expand in Asia.

AFN: What has been the biggest challenge that Future Crops has faced so far – and how did the team overcome that challenge?

GG: I think that the biggest challenge is about scalability and making sure you perfect your algorithm to achieve such a level of output that you could market highest-quality crops at market prices – but also earn money from it. The challenge is big, but every day we progress. Our expertise and technology allow us to shorten the time needed to develop new crops more efficiently and reach the level at which we can commercialize them in the market.",,[],[]
Cargill-MacMillan family members propelled onto top billionaire list,"Three of Cargill‘s largest individual shareholders — who are members of the Cargill-MacMillan family that gave the US agribusiness company its name — have been added to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which lists the 500 richest people in the world.

Siblings Austen Cargill, James Cargill II, and Marianne Liebmann — who are great-grandchildren of William Wallace Cargill, who founded the company in 1865 — have seen their personal fortunes grow by a fifth since the start of this year, to reach about $5.4 billion each.

Other agrifood billionaires featured in the recently released Bloomberg index include seven members of the Mars family and five members of the Walmart-owning Walton family.

Why it matters:

Agribusiness majors like Cargill have seen earnings soar over the past couple of years as commodity prices have risen, due to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and other factors. Louis Dreyfus Company reported an 82% bounce in profits for 2021, according Bloomberg; while Archer-Daniels-Midland has seen its valuation surge over 25% over the last two months. The UN’s global Food Price Index hit an all-time high last month.

Other members of the Cargill-MacMillan family appearing on the Bloomberg list include Pauline Keinath and Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer, also great-grandchildren of William Wallace Cargill, with $8.06 billion each.

According to Bloomberg, the Cargill-MacMillans were the world’s 11th richest family as of last year, with an estimated collective fortune of $51 billion. The extended Cargill-MacMillan family controls about 87% of the company which shares their name, deriving an estimated $115 billion in annual revenues from their stakes, Forbes reports.",,[],[]
USDA commits $1bn to 'climate-smart commodities',"US Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack has announced that the country’s Department of Agriculture (USDA) will invest $1 billion over the next year into “climate-smart” farming.

The initiative — Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities — will provide funding for pilot projects that “create market opportunities” for commodities which are “produced using [farming, ranching or forestry] practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester carbon.”

Successful applicants will receive the funding via the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation, which they will then provide as incentives to producers and landowners.

Why it matters:

‘Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities’ is the latest in a string of big-ticket initiatives aimed at boosting sustainable food production — including through tech-enabled methods and models — that the USDA has launched since the Biden administration came to power in January 2021.

Speaking at COP26 in November, Vilsack said the agency would invest $25 million across 18 climate-smart innovation projects.

A month before, it pumped funding into cultivated meat for the first time, awarding $10 million to create the first US National Institute for Cellular Agriculture.

And just last week, it unveiled the first-ever Federal Advisory Committee for Urban Agriculture, which includes agrifoodtech entrepreneurs such as Gotham Greens co-founder Viraj Puri and Symbiotic Aquaponic co-founder Kaben Smallwood among its members.

For this latest $1 billion initiative, Vilsack acknowledged many farmers are apprehensive about adopting regenerative ag practices due to perceived costs and other pitfalls.

“This program […] can essentially reduce the risk to farmers so that they can learn how to do it and see the positive results,” he told Reuters.",,[],[]
Lightsmith Group leads $60m round for digital ag startup Solinftec,"Disclosure: AFN’s parent company, AgFunder, is an investor in Solinftec.

Brazil- and US-based farm management startup Solinftec has secured a $60 million growth investment round to expand its precision agriculture platform.

Lightsmith Group led the round with participation from existing investors Unbox Capital and Circularis Partners and several undisclosed investors.

Solinftec will use the funds to expand availability of its digital-ag operating system in North and South America.

Solinftec says its precision-ag farm operating system manages more than 27 million acres in the US, Brazil and other parts of Latin America, focusing on sugarcane, soy, corn and cotton, as well as perennials like coffee, timber, and citrus. The company says it currently serves 85% of Brazilian sugarcane growers.

A core goal of the company is to provide growers with better information to inform decision-making around planting, spraying, harvesting, and tendering and improve farms’ sustainability. Its digital-ag platform links to farm machinery and is powered by an AI system called ALICE.AI that connects with sensors, computers and displays to provide growers with real-time, in-field crop data, information about inputs, and weather conditions.

“Our mission is to give each farm a sustainable future, promoting the accessibility of technologies to producers and transforming agriculture into a more productive practice, while preserving the planet,” Solinftec CEO Britaldo Hernandez said in a statement.

Solinftec recently struck a partnership with US-based ag cooperative Growmark to develop a new farm management robot to “increase yields, avoid wasted inputs, and lower environmental impacts.”

The company said its precision ag platform had enabled customers to avoid over 680,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions from 2016 to 2021 — roughly the same as planting 30 million trees or electrifying 700,000 cars each year.

Latin America is especially vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change. The most recent report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notes that Latin America faces “greater vulnerabilities” than developed countries to climate change, which “could affect the region’s role as a food producer and lead to food insecurity.”

Last year, Solinftec said it became the world’s first agtech company to secure ‘climate bond’ financing. It raised 140 million reals ($26.6 million) in the form of a Green Agribusiness Receivables Certificate (CRA-Green) – a form of fixed income instrument which allows businesses in the agrifood sector to securitize the payments they are owed by their customers. The CRA-Green is issued in accordance with standards set by the global Climate Bonds Initiative.",,[],[]
Ukraine crisis highlights how crucial climate stability is for food security,"Editor’s Note: Helena Wright is policy director at the FAIRR Initiative and Alexander Burr is ESG policy lead at Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), both based in London, UK.

The views expressed in this guest commentary are the authors’ own and do not necessarily represent those of AFN.

The crisis in Ukraine has damaged an already weakened post-Covid global food system. It has also highlighted the vulnerabilities of that system’s interconnectedness. Both Ukraine and Russia are significant producers and exporters of commodities including wheat and maize, meaning that the short-term impact on food security and prices is being felt right across the world. Vulnerable populations in lower-income countries are likely to be the most affected, worsening the global hunger and malnutrition crisis. So as policymakers around the world look to respond and strengthen our collective food security, what other systemic issues and policy interventions should they consider whilst making these decisions?

Climate change and biodiversity risk

When we look at the impact of the Ukraine crisis on food security over the long-term, we must not forget to consider the impacts of climate change. The outlook is increasingly uncertain in the face of accelerating and persistent interruptions. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has highlighted that 10% of existing areas for food production could be unsuitable for crops and livestock by mid-century. Unfortunately, these risks are already starting to materialize – such as the recent floods in Australia which caused significant losses and damages to crops.

We also cannot overlook biodiversity and nature loss in this policy discussion. For example, a recent report from the Central Banks & Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System stated that $235 billion to $577 billion of global crop production depends on pollination. This underscores how vital it will be to ensure farming methods do not have unintended consequences for ecosystem services.

Agriculture policy is key

Agricultural policy is a challenging and complex area to reform. This is not surprising given many operations rely on government programs to stay viable. As a sector, this is key to strengthening global food security – and to a ‘just transition’ to net-zero emissions (agriculture amounts to 10% of total EU emissions). It is therefore necessary that policymakers across markets look to reform their agricultural programs and regulation in the short term, enabling delivery against long-term sustainability goals and challenges.

In this regard, a group of investors with over $2 trillion in assets under management — backed by FAIRR, LGIM, Chatham House, and a consortium of other policy experts — last year called on the EU to align reforms of its Common Agricultural Policy with climate change and nature goals. The letter highlighted that proposals for reform do not go far enough, and risk undermining the EU’s own net-zero commitment. In addition, sustainable agricultural investments have the potential to deliver triple wins for climate, nature, and health ecosystems – turning agriculture and land use systems into a net ‘carbon sink.’

Next steps: localize and diversify

If we compare the energy sector and fossil fuel dependence, the Ukraine crisis highlights the high level of dependence that extant food systems have on inputs such as animal feed and fertilizer. Currently, 60% of the world’s maize crop and 20% of the world’s wheat crop is fed to livestock, leading to greater competition between food and feed. Russia is also a major producer of fertilizer, accounting for 13% of global output.

The current geopolitical situation could prove to be a ‘catalyst’ for more localized investment in sustainable food, such as diversifying into alternative protein and agroecological approaches. Investing in sustainable protein innovations can reduce pressure on grain for animal feed as well as land resources. Meanwhile, investing in agroecological approaches can decrease dependence on fertilizer.

As we reflect on the current crisis and look ahead to these increasing pressures — and the risk of further political complexities — there is a clear need to support sustainable agriculture through regulation and policy. Agricultural programs should be reformed to deliver on both climate change mitigation and long-term food security. Agricultural policy must enable a ‘just transition to net zero, minimize biodiversity loss, and build a more robust, resilient, and stable global food system.

As an example, if we look at an EU level again, we would be keen to see the Farm to Fork shift towards a more resilient and sustainable farming system – and secure food supplies over the long term. The EU should keep up the momentum generated from the Green Deal and follow through on its ambitious plans to restore biodiversity, reduce pollution and ensure climate stability.",,[],[]
Leaf is helping Bayer 'quickly expand' FieldView's digital partnerships,"G. Bailey Stockdale is CEO of Leaf, a food and agriculture data infrastructure startup. Here he reveals his company’s partnership with Bayer and the impact on its Climate FieldView business so far.

Bayer Crop Science’s digital agriculture arm, Climate, first launched FieldView in 2015 to help growers make data-driven decisions to maximize returns on every acre. This digital farming platform allows growers to collect, store and analyze their data in one place with compatibility across many equipment types and connectivity to multiple farm management software systems.

A key focus for FieldView is to connect partners via an API to give farmers more ways to access and use their data. The goal, they say, is to give the farmers the availability of their data, wherever they want it, whenever they want it.

Growing partnerships with Leaf

But as Bayer started building its ecosystem, the team realized they were spending too much time on the logistics of connecting with their API partners. That cut into the time they could spend doing what they do best: creating a valuable tool for farmers.

Seth Erwin, strategic account lead with Bayer’s Climate FieldView, told me that the sheer amount of time it took to connect to ag partners was the biggest struggle. “Even though we’ve got a pretty large team internally, every partner is a little bit different and everyone’s got other priorities they’re working on as well. It’s not just flipping a switch and turning the connection on to get the data to flow,” he said.

So in 2021, we struck a deal with Bayer to help them onboard their partners faster and more efficiently by asking them to connect via Leaf. We have built tools to help developers easily connect with Climate and other data providers to access user-permissioned field boundaries, application data, planting data, harvest data, and more.

Erwin has told me that the difference in speed of integration is now weeks, not months or years as they were previously. This is in part because it mitigates the need for Bayer to have lengthy conversations with partners about the process as well as involving their engineers; in most cases, we’ve already had those upfront conversations with partners already and our extensive documentation, tutorials, and support team also help.

“From an integration standpoint, it’s been really smooth. Generally, we can tell when they’re starting the actual work because we get notified if there’s a scope missing from their API key for example, and I can work with engineering to get that added quickly and they just report back, ‘hey it’s done, we’re live.’ It’s just been super smooth on both sides, for us and the partners,” highlights Thomas Nesbitt, senior product manager with Bayer’s Climate FieldView team.

Another battle Bayer faced was prioritizing which OEM partner to connect with first, often spending valuable time getting internally aligned. But now, we can help Bayer to run multiple implementations in parallel so the team can get started with new partners faster.

We waited to announce this until it was proven to be working for companies with real-world results. For example, Bayer partners such as Aegro, ARVA Intelligence, Hutchinsons, Landus Cooperative, and Ceres Solutions Cooperative have worked together with Leaf to launch production-ready FieldView integrations in just a few weeks; integrations that include the bi-directional transfer of field boundaries, planted, applied, and harvest data, prescriptions, and more.

“Our teams can now focus on increasing the value that FieldView’s partner program can bring to growers, while Leaf manages the technical aspects, ensuring they have the option and ability to connect to other innovative solutions,” said Sachi Desai, senior director of Digital Partnerships, Bayer Crop Science.

Minimize API maintenance

In the past, Climate was also bogged down with the ongoing maintenance of their own API and their partner’s connections.

“The maintenance piece was where, as we began to scale and started to really get a significant number of partners up, we realized we were not resourced for this. That again led to our decision to create our partnership with Leaf. Previously, it took a tremendous amount of time to get integrated and then there was always a bit of maintenance that seemed to continue to occur,” said Erwin.

Now that Climate works with us to facilitate connections with their partners, they can focus on their core purpose: creating a great tool for farmers to capture, analyze and use data.

“It’s not stuck in our system. Farmers can take the data somewhere else and work with folks that are focusing on different areas. We know farmers have hundreds of decisions to make a day. And, to believe that one system can provide all those solutions, I think isn’t right. The API gives us the ability to enable farmers to use that data across any network for decisions,” he added.

In addition to helping farmers use their data, Climate is also able to provide similar value to ag retailers, although as Nesbitt stressed to me, “From our perspective, grower control is still top on the list. We’ve always committed to growers owning their data and doing with their data what they want to do. But certainly, as retailers have made decisions on whether to dive deep into building their own products, or adopt other products, this need for the interoperability of ag data has certainly grown.”

‘Skyrocketing’ activity

Since Bayer and Leaf began to work together, engagement on Climate’s platform has skyrocketed from farmers who are actively using Climate FieldView data, according to Erwin who said the team has seen higher traffic going into its APIs since the partnership began and the number of integrated partners has increased. Jeremy Williams, head of Climate and all of Bayer’s digital farming group, has also heard good things and told us “Leaf’s technology is helping us quickly expand the FieldView API ecosystem and the Leaf team is hyper-responsive, organized, and a pleasure to work with.”

At Leaf, we agree that the future of agtech is rooted in partnership. As new ways to realize value from data emerge, there will be increased demand across the industry for accessible, interoperable, and quality data.

“To me, the future vision is this seamless transfer of data. Let farmers send and retrieve data as they want to, and in and out of the systems that they want to use. From a provider or company standpoint, let the data flow,” added Nesbitt.",,[],[]
Anuvia aims to have its biofertilizer on 20m farm acres by 2025,"US biofertilizer company Anuvia Plant Nutrients has packed a lot of milestones into a short period of time, its latest being a $65.5 million Series D fundraise co-led by Riverstone Holdings and Piva Capital.

Morgan Stanley Investment Management and LK Advisers, the family office of the Mittal steel magnate dynasty, participated along with existing investor Pontifax AgTech.

The round follows Anuvia’s $103 million Series C raise from last year.

“We’ve become a sustainable tool that can really help drive large-scale agriculture, and we can do it in a really quick and efficient way in terms of adoption curves,” Anuvia CEO Amy Yoder told AFN.

On background:

Florida-based Anuvia manufacturers biofertilizer for the agriculture, turf, and lawncare industries. The company says its ag-specific product SymTRX can improve crop yields for large-scale farming operations while replenishing soil and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Anuvia’s technology breaks organic waste materials down into amino acids and peptides combined with nutrients to feed plants and the soil. The process is similar to what occurs in the soil naturally – just sped up to increase efficiency and nutrient uptake in agricultural settings.

SymTRX, which currently targets corn, soybeans, wheat, canola, and sugar beet, is already available commercially in the US. Anuvia aims to have it on 20 million acres by 2025.

The company struck a deal with phosphate-mining company Mosaic in 2019 to use the latter’s Plant City, Florida facility for manufacturing. It has the capacity to put out up to 1.2 million tons per year, which would service more than those 20 million acres that Anuvia’s targeting.

It has also partnered with biologicals company a pipeline [of] different products” aimed at reducing the agricultural sector’s need for synthetic fertilizers, Yoder said. Novozymes to develop “aimed at reducing the agricultural sector’s need for synthetic fertilizers, Yoder said.

An audit conducted by consultants Environmental Resources Management found that for every 1 million acres of crops that use Anuvia’s products, the GHG reduction is equivalent to removing up to 30,000 cars from the roads.

How it’ll spend the funding:

Anuvia plans to increase capacity at its US manufacturing facility and accelerate commercialization of SymTRX.

Via the aforementioned deal with Mosaic, Anuvia will increase manufacturing in Plant City in order to produce more of its product in North America.

Anuvia will also research potential new products, such as biopesticides and biofungicides.

While North America is the focus market for now, Yoder said says Anuvia also has “some global initiatives.” Details on those partnerships are still under wraps.

The bigger picture:

Yoder suggested that farmers are “much more receptive than they would have been five years ago” to biofertilizers and other bio-based inputs, for a few different reasons:",,[],[]
12 agtech takeaways from 12 conversations with global agriculture experts,"Rhishi Pethe is the creator of “Software is Feeding the World,” a free weekly newsletter about tech trends in food and agriculture, and head of product management for Project Mineral at X.

It is believed the English accent changes every few miles in England.

It is a rare Professor Higgins who understands the nuances of different accents, and places them within specific London neighborhoods. Many of these differences are related to the historical development of English in the British Isles.

Similarly to accents, agriculture changes by region. Agricultural practices, challenges, and opportunities are different in, say, Iowa compared to India. There are differences at regional levels as well – for example, between east and west Nebraska.

To better understand some of these differences, I had conversations with 12 agriculture experts from Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia, and the US.

These countries account for 48% of the world’s population, and the plurality of the farming population. The conversations I had with the agriculture experts highlighted stark differences – not just in land holding size, crops, and access to technology, but also in go-to-market strategies, infrastructure, and improvement potential.

Here are 12 key takeaways from the 12 conversations:

Connie Bowen (US, AgLaunch; The Yield Lab Institute)

Agtech needs diversity in financing, as the VC model is not always the right fit. US agriculture is homogenous, in terms of who farms. The industry needs to be intentional to increase the diversity of voices and solutions within agriculture.

Carl Lippert (US, FeedX)

Most problems are culture problems – and that’s true for agriculture problems, too. Tech people need to understand farming culture, which is an ‘opt-out’ rather than ‘opt-in’ culture in the US. If we believe in a “definite future” philosophy, we should work towards making it happen.

Kim Keller (Canada, The Do More Agriculture Foundation)

Agriculture is not just about inputs, machinery, and yields. Humans are a key part of it, and farmers’ mental health is fragile due to factors outside their control [and] unreal expectations of themselves. Farmers need mental health help and support.

Mark Young (US, LandTrust; ex-Climate Corporation)

Farmers need to find new sources of value outside of yield, as yield in row crops is a commodity. Technology and automation will redefine what it will mean to “farm” in the future.

Sarah Mock (US, journalist and author)

The prevailing narrative of a small family farm in the US needs to be re-examined. The current carbon market euphoria in agriculture is not founded in science — yet — and we should think hard before deciding to pay farmers for carbon sequestration.

Eli Pollak (Kenya, Apollo Agriculture)

In Africa, access to financing for inputs — and the ability to provide a flexible product bundle of financing, inputs, and technology which meets the needs of a farmer — can not only be a profitable business at scale, but also put farmers on a path to prosperity and entry into the middle class.

Megz Reynolds (Canada, The Do More Agriculture Foundation)

Policy needs to be science-based and is an important lever to help with the adoption of technology. An ‘us-versus-them’ mentality — farmers versus consumers — in agriculture is counterproductive. Respectful conversations will lead to better understanding and better outcomes.

Venky Ramachandran (India, analyst and consultant)

You cannot push the developed world’s model of ag and agtech to a developing country like India. A typical zero marginal cost mentality for technology does not work well in India.

Xin Yi Lim (China, Pinduoduo)

A laser focus on customer value, while providing a fun experience, will create deep engagement and scale your business. A direct connection between consumers and farmers accelerates the learning and feedback loop, and can be used to drive innovation at the farm level.

Patrick Gerlich (Indonesia, Bayer Crop Science)

Digital tools should augment the human relationships inherent in smallholder farming. You cannot reach millions of smallholder farmers without collaboration and a multi-tier distribution network.

Kellan Hays (Zambia, Good Nature Agro)

Smallholder farmers in Africa need full farm support. Innovative financing models which combine cash and in-kind can provide that support. Farmers can benefit through valuable supply chain connections, access to better inputs, and markets for their products.

Jehiel Oliver (Nigeria, Hello Tractor)

Mechanization, access to good quality inputs, and a market for products can improve the lives of millions of farmers in Africa. Farmers are looking for access to basic infrastructure.

"Covid-19 is a 'wake-up call' to act on Southeast Asia's food waste crisis, experts say","Fruits and vegetables thrown into a waste bin Peter Dazeley | The Image Bank | Getty Images

SINGAPORE — Covid-19 is a wake-up call that's highlighted the urgency to fight the world's food waste crisis, experts and industry players told CNBC. Amid global lockdowns and halted travel, the pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of supply networks, as disruptions created bottlenecks in farm labor, transport and logistics and sparked global food shortages and price hikes. ""The pandemic is a very good wake-up call,"" said William Chen, director of the Food Science and Technology Program at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Before Covid-19, people took climate change less seriously because food came by easily. But now this issue starts to surface in people's minds,"" he added. ""I don't see it as a lost cause, but a good opportunity to do a house-cleaning of the current system."" Food waste remains one of the biggest global challenges. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that one third of all food produced — or 1.3 billion tonnes — ends up lost or wasted every year. Food waste also accounts for 8% to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, another UN report showed. Reducing food waste could yield $700 billion in savings, according to Boston Consulting Group. And businesses in Southeast Asia are jumping on the bandwagon and going into food waste prevention, as well as redistribution and recycling of excess food.

Growing appetite to tackle food waste

In 2020, Singapore generated 665,000 tonnes of food waste, making up about 11% of the total waste generated in Singapore.



Coming out of the pandemic, more hotels and airlines are now tackling food waste and putting sustainability ""front and center"" on their priority list, said Rayner Loi, co-founder and chief executive of Singapore-based AI food waste management start-up, Lumitics. This was a stark change from a few years back when food waste was ""barely on the radar"" and it was ""incredibly challenging"" to have conversations with industry players, said Loi. The growing receptiveness is thanks in part to increased education, new government regulations and sustainability being high on the corporate agenda, he said.

The firm developed an artificial intelligence-powered tracker installed in dustbins to measure and track all food waste. By learning in real time what and how much food waste was generated, chefs could take action to reduce the amount produced for certain dishes on the buffet line. This reduces food waste by up to 40%, and food costs by up to 8%, Lumitics found. From 2024 onwards, owners and occupiers of commercial and industrial premises in Singapore that generate large amounts of food will be required to segregate their food waste for treatment, according to a new legislation. Lumitics partners large hotel chains like Accor, Hyatt, Marina Bay Sands, as well as carriers such as Singapore Airlines and Etihad Airways. It plans to expand to 1,000 locations in the next five years across Asia-Pacific starting with Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia. ""The entire industry is starting to wake up to this idea that food waste is one of the largest untapped cost saving opportunities for any kitchen,"" said Loi.

Turning food waste into 'surprise boxes'

Another player fighting food waste is Yindii, a Thai anti-food waste startup. It launched an app to connect eco-conscious Bangkok residents with bakeries, cafes, supermarkets and restaurants. These businesses fill up their unsold inventory in ""surprise boxes,"" which customers can snap up at discounted prices of 50% to 80% off at the end of the day, and get them delivered to their homes. Yindii founder and French entrepreneur Louis-Alban Batard-Dupre described Bangkok's food waste situation as ""catastrophic,"" where only 2% of food waste is recycled. In Thailand, some 17 million tonnes of unused food is dumped each year, and about 64% of its 27.4 million tonnes of waste is made up of organic waste, which includes food and kitchen waste.

Most of the food businesses we've met think they don't waste much. When they start making quick calculations of what 6% to 14% of extra revenues mean, we usually get a call back. Louis-Alban Batard-Dupre founder, Yindii

Industry players themselves have highly underestimated the problem. ""Most of the food businesses we've met think they don't waste much. When they start making quick calculations of what 6% to 14% of extra revenues mean, we usually get a call back,"" he said. Mindsets of merchants are changing too, as more brands prepare for a sustainable post-Covid tourism future, he said. Back then, they were ""shy to say they generate food waste because it reveals their stores don't sell out every day or because it's a dirty word,"" said Batard-Dupre. ""But telling the world you're fighting for the planet is so much more powerful than trying to hide such a systemic problem every business has.""

To date, Yindii has seen over 20,000 surprise boxes bought up. Redistributing the food that would have been thrown out also helps many living under the poverty line, he said.



Yindii's partners include hotels such as Hilton Sukhumvit Bangkok, Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok, Sofitel Bangkok Sukhumvit and JW Marriott. Over the next few months, it is looking to expand to other cities in Thailand and South East Asia.

Technology as a way forward

Technology is starting to play a bigger role in tackling food waste. Southeast Asia is particularly vulnerable to food waste because it has many small-scale farm holdings that rely on intensive livestock farming and lack the means to invest in more efficient agri-tech, said Chen from NTU, who is also a consultant to the Asian Development Bank. The growing middle income class also consumes more. One of the UN Sustainable Development Goals aims to halve food waste by 2030 at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest.

Wildtype reels in $100m to bring sushi-grade cultivated salmon to the US,"Why it matters:

The San Francisco-based startup launched a pilot facility in the city last year and is betting hard on US distribution in the near future. Last December it signed distribution agreements with grocery store and sushi bar operator Snowfox and quick service restaurant Pokéworks, which will put its products in almost 1,300 stores.

The catch? Wildtype has to get approval to sell its cultivated salmon in the US before it can progress those deals any further. So far, no company developing cell-cultured meat has received such clearance from the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA).

Wildtype says it has been in consultation with the FDA since 2019 and is “impressed by the agency’s speed and thoughtfulness in approaching cellular agriculture.” Neither Wildtype nor the FDA has hinted at a specific timeframe for approval.

That elusive approval, along with the need to scale in order to compete in the broader seafood market, are Wildtype’s two biggest challenges for the moment. Progress on these could influence the course of the entire cultivated seafood market, which is still in its early days.",,[],[]
