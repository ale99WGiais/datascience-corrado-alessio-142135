Data driven methods to boost microalgae production and CO2 capture,"Microalgae are a promising feedstock for a large number of products such as fuel, food, and materials. At the same time, algae are able to fix large amounts of CO2 that they use for growth. Approximately 50% of the algae biomass is carbon, and as such, microalgae hold great potential to support efforts to tackle climate change. However, large-scale algae farming faces technical challenges that hinder widespread, economically successful applications. VTT is coordinating a two-year research project involving the University of Jyväskylä, Neste, and seven Finnish SMEs, jointly addressing some of the bottlenecks in large-scale algal cultivation.



Project ROBA – Robust Algae Systems, funded by Business Finland, aims to tackle hurdles to create economically feasible algae processes through a combination of modeling, advanced measurement technology, bioprocess engineering, machine learning, and synthetic biology.

“Microalgae are one of the potential renewable and scalable future raw materials that Neste is developing, with the aim to expand our renewable raw material pool to support the future growth of renewables production. We are also looking for all possible solutions to reduce emissions in order to meet our ambitious goal of carbon-neutral production by 2035. Activities in the ROBA project will contribute to these targets by focusing on a concept for refinery CO2 capture with microalgae and by developing monitoring methods that could be utilized in large-scale algae cultivation,” explains Jason Michael Blake, Vice President of Innovation, Business Platform Aviation Feedstock, at Neste.

One bottleneck in algae cultivations to be addressed is the monitoring of contamination, which currently is a challenge in large-scale processes and can lead to the loss of entire cultures. In ROBA, a series of optical and other online methods will be explored. The measurement technologies to be developed in the project will be applicable also to other biotechnological processes.

“Industrial biotechnology is becoming more and more an important part of sustainable industrial practices. Our aim is to develop intensification methods for large-scale algal cultivation. Innovative measurement and monitoring technologies will help us move towards efficient and economically feasible production processes,” says Mervi Toivari, Principal Scientist at VTT Technical Research Center of Finland.

Machine learning promises to take process monitoring even one step further by combining various information received from the process into a more complete picture.

“This is a new opening to develop a novel on-site observer and computational methods for the needs of microalgae biotechnology. The Spectral Imaging Laboratory at the University of Jyväskylä focuses on developing a non-invasive monitoring method based on hyperspectral imager technology. Monitoring the growth and product accumulation of microalgae and detecting contamination are the key areas for the development,” says Pauliina Salmi, Postdoctoral Researcher from the University of Jyväskylä.

Microalgae protein company Brevel raises $8M in a seed funding round,"Brevel recently announced it has raised $8.4M in a seed funding round. The microalgae-based alternative protein company’s investors include FoodHack, Good Startup VC, Tet Ventures and Nevateam Ventures among others from the food tech industry. The round also included significant funding from the EU’s Horizon2020 program and Israel’s Innovation Authority in the form of non-dilutive grants.

Yonatan Golan, CEO and co-founder of Brevel, told NutraIngredients-USA​ that the funding will be utilized for the construction and operation of the company’s first commercial facility, which is slated to be up and running in the next few months.

“We are now working on closing the first contracts and will be in products on shelves by the end of the year. Additionally, the funds will be used for improving the value we can provide to our partners with an improved product and scaling Brevel’s proprietary technology and enhancing R&D capabilities,”​ Golan said.

Tech

According to Golan, who started the company in 2017 with his two brothers, microalgae is typically produced either by photosynthesis in ponds or closed reactors which are very labor intensive, suffer from contaminations and produce at low yields and high costs. The alternative is to use fermentation tanks where sugar is added to the process and then the microalgae grow and significantly lower costs and higher yields. However, this is done today in the dark. With the absence of light, many of the ingredients, functionalities and benefits of microalgae are lost in the process.

“We are the first company globally who has been able to combine sugar based fermentation and light in a single process. We produce affordable microalgae at very high yields which are rich with all of the functionalities, ingredients and nutrients that are only produced in the presence of light. We already operate at commercial scale reactors and are now building our first commercial factory in Israel.”​

Brevel’s technology is based on high-tech indoor, sterile and fully automated systems which are illuminated from within at high intensity. The novel process enables the production of microalgae at a cost reduction of more than 90% and includes nutrient rich ingredients and functionalities that are only produced in the presence of light. Now with the closing of their seed funding round, conditions are ripe for the next stage of mass production.

Applications

“Brevel's protein has a full amino acid profile and very high digestibility scores,” ​said Golan. “In addition, Brevel's protein has a very mild flavor and color which makes it very suitable for food applications where flavor masking is not an option.”​

The alt-protein comes as a dry powder which can be added directly to formulations. Brevel’s partners add it in different forms - either directly as powder, or apply processes such as homogenization, or secondary fermentation to increase its solubility, extract additional flavors and more.

In terms of functionality, Golan said that they’re currently trying to be as inert as possible by increasing the nutritional profile of products without changing taste, color, texture or cost for the end consumer. “One of our piloting partners described it as a ‘ghost protein’–it increases protein content without you noticing it is there.”​

US engagement

“Brevel’s protein solves immediate challenges in plant-based dairy and egg products that lack a valuable nutritional profile due to the need for very mildly flavored protein sources. Due to the high nutritional values and sustainable production in the mid and long terms, Brevel is aiming to become the #1 choice for plant-based protein worldwide, including the US which is a major market for plant-based products,”​ Golan said.",,[],['Danielle Masterson']
Microalgae-based animal feeds could fill protein gap,"Why the future of protein production could be green and slimy

Algae may be the king of renewable super-plants with myriad potential applications ranging from biofuels, pharmaceuticals and biofertilizer to animal feed and human food.

Algae grow faster than conventional crops and require fewer resources — only a little sun, water and CO 2 , making it one of the most sustainable raw materials on earth. In fact, 1 kg of algae biomass can store almost 2 kg of CO 2 while releasing 1.6 kgs of oxygen.

Algae’s sustainable qualities help it stand out as a frontrunner in the alternative protein game. As more restaurants, grocery retailers and food brands implement sustainability initiatives across the supply chain, algae-derived ingredients are poised to gain popularity.

“It doesn’t require arable land, which is a huge advantage over crops,” said Michael McGoldrick, market manager Industrial BioTech/Starch, GEA. “Some species also do well in brackish or salt water, which means you aren’t fighting over the same resources as the other crops.”

However, production costs are a big challenge for today’s algae producers. That’s why investment in processing technologies are ramping up while efforts are underway to expand the algae market in the future.

Filling the protein gap — with plants

By the middle of this century, we’ll need more than an additional 250 million tons of protein to feed the world’s projected population. To bridge the protein gap, researchers and processing equipment suppliers are eyeing single-cell organisms — the kind of algae that contain up to 70% protein — for solutions.

GEA is one of several partners from the EU’s scientific and business community to form the Sustainable Algae Biorefinery for Agriculture and Aquaculture (SABANA) project in 2016 to focus on refining algae to support sustainable food production.

McGoldrick identified several factors driving interest and investment in the development of plant-based alternative proteins.

“The market is looking for a functional, complete protein as customers have shown a high interest in plant-based alternatives due to environmental and health beliefs,” McGoldrick said. “There are very few complete plant proteins with the full amino acid profile that humans need, so the easiest way to get around that is to blend various plant proteins, including microalgae.”

Microalgae, or phytoplankton, can provide valuable proteins, pigments and unsaturated fatty acids, along with loads of untapped opportunity. Bühler Group is another company actively engaging with the industry and academia on novel technologies to unlock the full potential of single-celled microorganisms for food and feed production.

Bühler Group’s experts estimate 200,000 to 500,000 microalgae species exist in nature, yet only about 20 species are being commercially explored today. Commercial production of more algae species could help replace a significant amount conventional crop-based animal feed protein demand in the coming decades.

Microalgae market expansion hurdles

One of the biggest challenges microalgae production faces is cost-related – partly because the algal biomass must be processed to separate it from the water it was grown in. And accessing the nutritional benefits of some microalgae relies on opening the cell wall to allow for optimal digestibility.

Getting to the highest added value, functional ingredients from microalgae often require a cell disruption stage. Bühler offers bead milling technology as flexible, energy-efficient solution to open the microalgae wall in suspension. The design allows users to easily validate and optimize their process at lab scale and subsequently scale to industrial capacities, and may one day be key to affordably scaling microalgae production worldwide.

According to McGoldrick, centrifuges are another economical means to efficiently process microalgae due to its biological makeup. This method uses less energy than ceramic membrane filtration and is a better alternative to traditional rotary vacuum filters because cell size can cause binding or blockages.

Companies like GEA and Bühler are actively researching and supplying novel processing systems that don’t compromise the nutritional value of each microalgae cell, but still, more processing innovations are needed to bring microalgae ingredients to the mainstream.

Looking ahead 15 to 20 years, where does McGoldrick predict the research on algae processing and nutrition will take us?

“As the costs of production come down, more and more possibilities open up,” he said. “With GMO algae, there are very few limits — once the economics are figured out.”

Quick algae facts : Plant-based superfood

Size matters. There are two types of algae: macro and micro. Both are food sources that release oxygen into the atmosphere during photosynthesis, but macroalgae is larger, known as seaweed, and is an excellent marine filter. Meanwhile microalgae are microscopic (between 2-10 micrometers), single-celled organisms — commonly known as phytoplankton.

Thai Union embraces microalgae-based ingredients with new investment,"Thai Union joins other industry-leading financial partners to accelerate the expansion of Mara’s proven portfolio of micro-algal products and unique innovation. After investing CAD $10 million as part of Mara's CAD $39.5 million growth funding round, Thai Union will appoint one representative to join Mara’s board of directors. Mara, based in Nova Scotia, Canada, is one of the world’s leading producers of sustainably grown algae-based bio-products. Since its inception in 2012, Mara has successfully built a portfolio of micro-algal strains, some of which are processed using a clean, environmentally-friendly extraction method into high quality algal oil. The plant-based oil offers a non-GMO vegan option for DHA-rich omega-3 fatty acids for human nutrition. Mara’s ingredients are approved by multiple respected regulatory bodies, and are used by leading infant nutrition, supplement and food and beverage customers worldwide.

“As an industry leader in innovation and sustainability, we are committed to our ingredients business which valourises our co-products into natural and nutritional ingredients such as DHA-rich tuna oil,” said Thiraphong Chansiri, President and CEO of Thai Union.

“Our strategic partnership with Mara further builds on this business by creating opportunities to jointly expand our product portfolios, grow our global presence, and accelerate go-to-market initiatives. We’re excited to partner with Mara and together provide nutritious and sustainably sourced DHA omega-3 fatty acids to consumers worldwide,” Chansiri continued.

Thai Union’s commitment to sustainable nutrition aligns closely with Mara’s mission. In 2018, Thai Union started its ingredients business to transform its co-products from fish processing into natural ingredients for human nutrition. It creates highest quality tuna oil by processing raw tuna heads through a low temperature extraction method that preserves the oil’s natural functionality. Thai Union’s tuna oil contains the highest DHA omega-3 fatty acids content compared to other fish sources.

Together with Mara, Thai Union is actively working to create more choices in the market for omega-3 fatty acids and expanding the reach of this critical nutritional element, from both algal and tuna-based sources. The investment creates opportunities for both companies to accelerate growth through cooperation in go-to-market, research and development and operations. Mara is exploring, for example, refining its crude algal oil at Thai Union’s state-of-the-art oil refinery in Rostock, northern Germany. Thai Union has also already been cooperating with Mara in Thai Union’s Omega-3 Center of Excellence at their headquarters in Samut Sakhon by performing successful trials using Mara's crude algal oil. Together, the two companies are well-positioned to serve the growing demand for omega-3-rich products.

"Brevel Raises $8.4 Million to Scale Nutrition-Rich, Neutral-Flavored Microalgae Protein","Move over pea protein and soy, there’s a new alt-protein in town made from microalgae, and it’s cheaper and more sustainable. Brevel, the Israeli company behind this alternative to the omnipresent ingredients in everything from plant-based burgers to dairy-free cheese, aims to become the number one choice for plant-based protein worldwide.

Brevel’s vision now becomes a business reality with the announcement of $8.4 million in a seed funding round. The funding will be utilized to build a commercial pilot factory which will serve as the basis for scaling the company’s proprietary technology and enhancing its research and development capabilities. Investors include FoodHack, Good Startup VC, Tet Ventures, and Nevateam Ventures.

The fermentation of microalgae as an alt-protein has been under consideration but has not made the headlines because of its cost and issues with flavor. Brevel says it has found a solution by combining sugar-based fermentation of microalgae with a high concentration of light at industrial scales. The company says its nutritionally rich, neutral-flavored microalgae-based protein solves issues with plant-based dairy and egg products that lack a valuable nutritional profile.

In an email interview with The Spoon, Brevel CEO and Co-Founder Yonatan Golan shared some additional details.

Will the company make its own microalgae foods or sell them to other manufacturers? Have there been any sample products created yet?

Our protein comes as a dry powder which can be simply added directly to formulations. Today, our partners add it in different forms – either directly as powder, or apply some processes such as homogenization, secondary fermentation, etc. to increase its solubility, extract additional flavors, and more. This depends on their specific needs and preferences.

One of our piloting partners described it as a “ghost protein” – it increases protein content without you noticing it is there. In the second stage, we will be looking to provide functionalities such as gelation, texturing, emulsification, and more, which are most suitable for fish and seafood alternatives.

We are piloting with many different food manufacturers worldwide who are very excited about our ability to increase their nutritional profile without changing taste, color, texture, or cost for the end consumer.

Later in June, we will be at the largest alternative protein conference (Future food tech) in NYC and will have an exclusive tasting room where we will showcase several of the products our partners developed with our protein – plant-based cheese with a high protein content which melts on pizza, sunny side up eggs with our protein both in the white and the yolk.

How did the company land on microalgae? From previous research?

My co-founders are my two brothers: Matan is an MD who brings the health angle (plant-based food products today have a very low nutritional value which must be solved if we want to have a healthy future), and this is a key element in our vision. The second, Ido, is a genius engineer who happens to have a vast background in microalgae and manages to invent this entirely new way of producing microalgae efficiently and at a very high quality. I am vegan both from a moral and sustainable standpoint and am enthusiastic about finding solutions to feed our growing population sustainably and ethically. I have three children who are also vegan, and I am very concerned about the future they will live in if we don’t make drastic changes. As a physicist, I view this challenge very rationally and believe that microalgae can become the ultimate solution, like many experts and companies. However, to date, no one has been able to solve the cost and quality barriers to make this vision become a reality.

This is why we decided to dedicate ourselves to working hard on this problem and have managed to break through the glass ceiling this industry has seen for too many decades.

To educate those who do not know what exactly is microalgae?

Microalgae are microscopic organisms that use photosynthesis to grow very resource efficiently. Microalgae evolved more than 2 billion years ago. For the first time in the prehistory of earth transformed most of the CO2 in our atmosphere into oxygen and enabled the development of more advanced forms of life. Even today, microalgae account for more than 50% of the oxygen production cycle daily.

Microalgae naturally contain 40%-60% protein alongside a variety of healthy ingredients.

Microalgae grow everywhere on our planet – lakes, rivers, oceans, and even deserts and the arctic. More than 500,000 different strains exist in nature, and only a small fraction have been researched. A handful is used for food, feed, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, fertilizers, and biofuel production. Brevel uses non-GMO microalgae grown in a unique breakthrough technology that enables the highest quality of sustainable protein production at cost levels comparable to pea and soy, the leading plant-based protein source today.

Mewery Looks To Slash Cultivated Pork Costs With Microalgae Ingredients,"4 Mins Read

Czech foodtech startup Mewery is developing cultivated pork on microalgae scaffolding. The company claims it is the first in Europe to be doing so. Using the regenerative plant base allows for significant production cost savings, reportedly of 70 percent. Mewery is eyeing 2026 for market entry, pending E.U. regulatory approval for cell-based meat.

The startup has recently received backing from Big Ideas Ventures in an undisclosed private investment round as part of the latter’s accelerator. A subsequent open funding raise is in the planning stage to bring fresh investors on board later this year. Mewery is not rushing to market, as despite other cultivated companies claiming to be ready to sell, the Czech startup has stated that more needs to be done to improve end products.

Meat produced in a different way

“We love meat but hate the way it’s done,” Mewery states. “That’s why we’ve decided to change that. We are a team bringing together business and science experience with one common goal – to cultivate meat without killing a single animal or harming the planet.”

Focussing on pork, Mewery stands to make a big impact on animal agriculture. It is the second most eaten meat in the world, with significant regions, including Asia and Europe, making it their first preference. The environmental impact of keeping up with worldwide demand is taking its toll, however, as are supply chain interruptions within the pig farming sector.

The global pork market is estimated to reach $258 billion by 2027. Asia remains the biggest driver, claiming more than 50 percent of total pork produced. 2022 is expected to see China produce more than 50 million metric tonnes of pig meat, compared to 47.5 million tonnes in 2021.

It is estimated that for every kilo of pork meat that is ready to eat, 6.1 kilos of carbon dioxide equivalent is released into the atmosphere. The footprint of the pork sector is causing concern, alongside other red and processed meats, particularly beef. Cultivated meat manufacturers are looking to offer conventional meat-eaters an alternative to simply switching to plant-based foods.

Taking pigs out of the equation

Mewery has deliberately avoided beef and poultry for its initial developments. The startup states that this is due to three considerations: there is scope to be a leader within porcine cells, the scale of the pork sector globally and competitive edge. Roman Lauš, founder and CEO of Mewery claims that most other cultivated companies are looking to produce beef or chicken, leaving a gap for a pork pioneer.

In an interview with Radio Prague, Lauš indicated that he is catering for meat fans, not vegans or vegetarians. He notes that within the Czech Republic there are existing plant-based meat alternatives, which fail to deliver on taste and texture, but that he is looking to develop real, clean pork. He states that his meat will allow people to make a significant impact on the environment, without having to change their diet. He accepts that education will be vital to consumer uptake, as well as price parity to conventional meat. Mewery is targeting the latter by avoiding the use of fetal bovine serum.

“One really needs to understand that the process of cultivating meat in the lab is just another process by which cells grow. It’s not Frankenstein-meat, it’s not something completely strange – these methods have been used in pharma for many years. The way we get meat now through industrial farming to our table is not sustainable – it cannot survive. So this is one of the options – not the only one, but one – for how to make our world more sustainable and to also get protein to an ever-growing population.”

The cultivated pork innovators

So far, most of the cultivated pork movement has been coming from Asia. In light of food security concerns arising from the African swine fever outbreak in 2019, Asia is looking to control its pork supply more carefully. When the outbreak was at its peak, China’s domestic pig numbers were decimated, leading to increased imports. As a consequence, an openness to domestic cultivated meat developments has been observed in Chinese officials, notably President Xi.

Shanghai-based CellX first debuted cultivated pork in 2021, alongside closing a $4.3 million funding round. Skip ahead to earlier this month and the startup has secured another $10.6 million in a Series A raise. Now the best-funded cultivated meat company in the country, CellX is pressing ahead with scaling for anticipated commercial pork production.

In South Korea, Space F is making progress with its own pork development, having recently unveiled version two. It came as the startup unveiled its new beef and chicken prototypes. Like Mewery, Space F has concentrated on creating serum-free meat, to maintain ethical advances over conventional meat production.

Microalgae is nature’s ‘green gold’: our pioneering project to feed the world more sustainably,"As a young child in the mid-1960s, my days were spent living an idyllic rural life on a dairy farm in the village of Lewdown in the heart of Devon. I recall many happy days exploring the glorious countryside, living a life in balance with nature and the environment – or at least, that’s how it felt.

But I also remember the ever-present slurry pit full of manure down at the end of our cowshed. It wasn’t fenced off, and my mum would remind me on regular occasions that to stray too close could mean death by drowning in what was, in essence, an enormous vat of smelly cow pats. As a five-year-old, I stayed well clear.

What we didn’t know then was that this pit of farm manure posed not only a hazard to me, but to our environment. Manure, which is often returned to the land as a nutrient fertiliser without consideration of its wider impacts, releases greenhouse gases including methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, and other harmful nitrogenous gases such as ammonia. It can also lead to nitrogen-rich run-off into water courses, polluting rivers, lakes and coastlines – with knock-on effects on fish mortality and tourism.

In short, what I thought was an idyllic childhood, living on a farm in balance with nature, wasn’t quite that. Subsequently, as a bioscientist, I’ve spent much of my life researching microorganisms that can help maintain a healthy planet. Nearly 60 years later, I find myself leading a pioneering Europe-wide project dedicated to transforming potentially harmful waste into something positive. In the process, we can help to build a “circular economy” that regenerates nature and keeps materials in circulation. And at the centre of this work are some remarkable microscopic organisms – our “green gold”.

Jewels of nature

We all know how important trees are in terms of sequestering carbon, yet we tend to overlook the two-thirds of our planet that is covered by water. Our seas and oceans are filled with organisms that are equally vital to the Earth’s life cycles, yet because they are individually less visible to the naked eye than land plants, we largely ignore them.

Microalgae – not to be confused with macroalgae (seaweeds) – are massively abundant in our seas, freshwater lakes and rivers. These tiny organisms are important “primary producers” on our planet, acting as biomass factories. They use sunlight through the process of photosynthesis to convert inorganic molecules (carbon dioxide, nutrients and water) into proteins, fats and carbohydrates, plus a host of other organic compounds that help them grow and survive. These tiny microorganisms support all life in our oceans and, with their high turnover rates, contribute to around 50% of the planet’s primary production.

There are literally hundreds of thousands of species of microalgae. A commonly occurring group are the diatoms, of which there are an estimated 20,000 species. With beautifully intricate, snowflake-like cell walls made of glass, diatoms are true jewels of nature. Another common group are the coccolithophores, covered in elaborate, frisbee-like calcium carbonate chalk plates. During the Cretaceous period, which ended 66 million years ago, enormous blooms of coccolithophores formed the white cliffs of Dover.

As microalgae do not have roots, leaves and stems, they can use carbon dioxide and nutrients more efficiently than land plants, enabling them to grow more rapidly. They can be relatively easily cultivated and harvested to produce biomass crops (“algaculture”) which can be used as food or for bioenergy. Algal biomass also contains a wide range of useful molecules that can be used in bioplastics, biofuel, health products, cosmetics and food ingredients.

My growing appreciation of these fascinating microorganisms, with their amazing ability to grow on waste nutrients and produce something useful, inspired me to want to help address the twin global challenges of sustainability and environmental protection. Using nature’s “green gold” to clean up waste nutrients while also producing sustainable feeds and other products seemed to me a no-brainer.

Back in the 70s, I recall my A-level biology teacher, Mr Montague, introducing us to the carbon and nitrogen cycles and explaining how important the balance of each of these cycles is to life on our planet. I even remember him talking about the greenhouse effect and temperature rise. But we didn’t realise back then just how severe the threat of carbon dioxide-related climate change was – or how nitrogen would emerge as a major contributor to the complex environmental challenges we face today.

Towards a circular economy

To have any hope of meeting our global climate change targets and achieving a sustainable equilibrium, we need to work towards a circular economy that eliminates waste and pollution, keeps materials in circulation and regenerates nature. This must replace our existing linear “use and discard” model which has led to unbalanced nutrient cycles.

In response to this, farmers, the food industry and waste-water companies are increasingly turning to anaerobic digestion (AD) to process their waste. AD is a natural process in which bacteria in large tanks called digestors feed on organic waste – sewage, food waste, farm manure and other agricultural waste – to produce a biogas, rich in carbon and hydrogen, that can be captured and used to generate renewable electricity and heat.

The nitrogen component of the organic waste is retained in a thick liquid called digestate, which can be returned to the land by farmers as a naturally produced fertiliser – preferable to synthetic fertilisers produced using energy-intensive and CO₂-emitting processes. However, as the AD industry has expanded, so the increased production and returning of digestate to the land poses a risk of nutrient pollution.

As a result, many areas in the United Kingdom and Europe are now restricted by the Nitrate Directive and nitrate vulnerable zone (NVZ) legislation, introduced to prevent pollution through excessive use of nitrogen returned to the land. Currently, 55% of land in England is designated an NVZ, while the entirety of Wales is in the process of becoming another such zone.

One way of overcoming this regulatory challenge is through the use of microalgae. And so, in 2017, our Europe-wide, circular economy project called ALG-AD was born. The ultimate goal is to convert nitrogen that poses a risk to the environment into microalgae that can be used in sustainable animal feed, replacing existing, highly resource-intensive sources of feed in the process. Using funding from the INTERREG North-West Europe programme, Swansea University partnered with ten other organisations throughout north-west Europe – a densely populated and intensely agricultural area that is particularly vulnerable to nitrate pollution of groundwater. The whole of Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark are also already designated NVZs.

By recycling unwanted nitrogen into something useful, we can prevent it escaping into the atmosphere and into waterways, thereby reducing pollution to both land and atmosphere. The microalgae naturally convert the nitrogen into protein and other nutritional molecules which can be used back in the food chain. Five years on from the project’s launch, we have already shown that such a circular economy solution is workable on an industrial scale.

A new source of protein

The projected growth of the planet’s population over the next half-century means global food production is expected to increase by at least 50%. We are also all being encouraged to reduce consumption of meat protein to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. New sources of protein are therefore a top priority, and microalgae are strong contenders. Companies such as Nestlé are already researching microalgae as an alternative source of protein, both as animal feed and food for humans.

While the microalgal production industry is still in its infancy, the ability to produce a new source of protein without the issues associated with meat and soya is very attractive. Furthermore, being able to cultivate microalgae close to where they will be used by farmers in animal feed offers another distinct advantage.

A big challenge for our European project has been to test this technology for development at full working scale. We have therefore worked directly with the AD industry as it processes food and farm waste, providing us with industrially produced nitrogen (in digestate) to cultivate our microalgae.

In the UK, just 30 miles from the Devon farm on which I lived as a child, we have built a pilot “algae-AD” facility at an AD company sited next to Langage Dairy Farm. Langage-AD has the capacity to process 20,000 tonnes of food waste a year, producing biomethane that generates heat and electricity. We were provided with a large, heated greenhouse situated right next to where the waste is processed. This was the ideal location for our “algal photobioreactor”, a series of vertical see-through tubes in which microalgae are grown in an aqueous medium containing nutrients that are exposed to both daylight and artificial light.

Two sister photobioreactor facilities have been built in Brittany in France and Ghent in Belgium. All partners have undertaken in-depth studies to determine how to best process the digestate and optimise nutrient uptake. Too much and we found that our microalgae didn’t like it; too little and not much happened.

Promisingly, we have found that microalgae grown on digestate are richer in protein compared with microalgae grown on more typically-used inorganic nutrients, with protein levels reaching up to around 80% of the total biomass produced. This is well over double the amount of protein contained in meat and soya products. In a world where there is an increasing protein shortage and alternatives to meat are sought, this is a real bonus.

Currently, around 75% of the world’s soya crop is used as a source of protein in animal feed. As with beef production, soya production has come under scrutiny for its role in deforestation, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. In addition, the transportation of soya across the globe generates a huge carbon footprint. To top it all, transporting soya to high agricultural areas disturbs the global balance of nitrogen, leading to “nutrient hotspots” and an increase in NVZs.

Our studies have confirmed the potential of microalgae as a protein source to supplement and replace soya protein. However, the scale of microalgal cultivation is currently not big enough to make a significant impact on soya markets. Therefore, our real-life feed trial experiments have so far concentrated on testing microalgae as a food supplement, to improve the health of piglets and of fish. But we know that the market for algae-based animal feed and ingredients is set to grow rapidly.

Rolling out these novel biotechnologies

To date in the UK, we have focused on two commonly occurring freshwater species of green microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus (both from the division Chlorophyta). Both species contain good levels of proteins and a host of molecules with beneficial properties for health, which we are still exploring.

But yet another amazing thing about microalgae is their diversity. There are tens of thousands of other species with a breathtaking variety of form and function, still waiting to be explored.

Now, supported by the groundwork of our research, it is up to pioneering businesses, regulators and investors to work together to enable the roll-out of these novel biotechnologies more widely. As we move to a society and economy more circular than linear, which uses its waste while preventing environmental contamination, it seems that microalgae will become more familiar to us all in one form or another.

Our project has already demonstrated that microalgae have strong potential in helping reduce food security-related issues such as land scarcity, climate change and inefficient and unsustainable fertiliser usage, as well as associated nutrient leakage and water pollution. In so doing, they can be used to raise environmental standards in Europe and throughout the world. Indeed, our work supports the recently announced European Green Deal, promoting the circular economy and protection of nature, and the new Common Agricultural Policy with its strong emphasis on environment-friendly farming practices and agro-ecology.

However, it is still relatively early days. As with any waste-related technology, legislation and regulation needs to be carefully considered. For now, the simplest way forward is to use anaerobically digested vegetable-based waste rather than animal-based waste, thereby eliminating the possibility of any animal waste or animal contamination passing back into the food chain.

We would also like to further increase the uptake of digestate into the algae and, like any new and developing technology, we need to balance up the cost and overall environmental benefits. To achieve this, we are gathering results from across the partnership and consolidating our data for use in life cycle analysis. This will also enable interested farmers, food producers and other industries to decide if the technology is for them, and what they might best achieve according to their particular needs.

Another way microalgae can be used to help in agriculture is as biostimulants – natural products that, when applied in small quantities, enhance nutrition uptake and improve stress tolerance, thus reducing the need for chemical fertilisers. We are also delving further into the many other valuable components within microalgal cells, including molecules that have benefits as human and animal immune modulators, anti-inflammatories and antivirals. The full benefits of microalgae to produce new products are just waiting to be reaped.

Ironically, throughout my working life, I didn’t exactly heed the advice of my mum all those years ago, to stay away from the dangerous mix of nutrients that was brewing in the manure pit at the end of our cowshed. But I would like to think, in not doing so, that I have been part of a revolution in the way we regard and treat waste, ensuring that the valuable nutrients in cow manure and other organic waste can increasingly be used for the benefit of us, and our planet.

Novel seafood startup secures $1.3 million funding,"Deep technology fund Outset Ventures, Tangaroa Ventures, Steven Adams, Ngāti Hineuru, Lee Kum Kee Family Council Chairwoman Andrea Lee and PāuaCo are amongst the range of prominent investors.



NewFish general manager and co-founder Hamish Howard says their plan to develop new foods from renewable and highly nutritious marine sources, unique to New Zealand, is what attracted investors locally and globally.

“The regeneration of our food and marine systems are at the heart of NewFish, as we must change the way we think about these systems if the status quo is to change. We are reimagining seafood and human nutrition to replenish our oceans,” he said in a press release.

NewFish has developed two first-of-their-kind products to date, a Pāua Saucisson and a microalgae-derived Ocean Mortadella, both developed by Vaughan Mabee of Amisfield.The company is undertaking multiple R&D streams to explore the unique nature of New Zealand pāua (abalone), microalgae and macroalgae (seaweed).



According to Howard, NewFish has international plans with global partnerships already established.

“We have an opportunity to build a cleaner, greener protein industry for Aotearoa, serving people across Asia Pacific and further afield. New Zealand is surrounded by water and we value the marine environment highly, so we should be known for our abundant, pristine oceans and the food they produce,"" he said.

Algae could help fuel the future. But it's not easy being 'green',"Algae could help fuel the future. But it's not easy being 'green'

On a patch of land between Riverview Park and the Red Mountain Freeway, two silvery metal domes tower over the Mesa wastewater treatment plant. The domes are called “anaerobic digesters,” and there are several hundred of them in the U.S.

Inside each dome, tiny organisms — bacteria — break down biological waste. But this story isn’t about bacteria. Because here in Mesa, there are some new microorganisms on the block.

Three oval-shaped ponds swirl with brilliant green water in a dirt lot below the domes. Floating in the lazy river-like current, swaths of tiny life forms glisten in the sunlight.

Algae.

Scientists in Arizona have been cultivating algae for several years, but this time, ASU researchers are working on a project with the city of Mesa in hopes of turning wastewater byproducts into fuel and other products. They want to harness the way algae naturally works to coax another use out of the gases that would otherwise be emitted as a result of the necessary process of breaking down human-produced wastewater.

The algae — more specifically microalgae, which are microscopic, single-celled organisms closely related to seaweed — take in carbon dioxide (the gas that humans breathe out) much the same way plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to create their own food.

“We’re taking advantage of that. We’re using waste as food for the microalgae,” said Justin Flory, the associate director of research in the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions at Arizona State University and the manager of the algae project.

Algae-based biofuels and products have been a dream for researchers and companies for several years, including for teams at ASU and the University of Arizona. In 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act called for 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels, including microalgae-based biofuels, by 2022. Algae biofuels are not yet produced commercially, according to the EPA.

Now, as the need for energy independence and security grow more urgent in the U.S., algae still isn’t being produced at a scale large enough to power cars, planes or anything else that requires energy. Meanwhile, many scientists say we need to electrify everything, fast, to meet climate goals, with the potential for dire consequences if we don’t.

Flory and other Arizona researchers think algae will play an important role in the move to a sustainable future. In the uncertain zone between where we are now and complete decarbonization, they say algae-based biofuels offer solutions for some of the toughest problems of the energy transition. Those include, for instance, addressing the limitations of intermittent power sources like solar and wind, reducing the impact of heavy transportation like cargo ships and, of course, improving the sustainability of unavoidable emitting processes like treating wastewater.

But for algae to reach its potential, its cultivators are up against big challenges. There are biological hurdles: Much like growers of agricultural crops on dry land, algae farmers need to achieve ideal conditions to maximize yields (and some even want to use genetic modification). Then there’s the task of converting a pond of green gunk into fuel, a design problem that engineers, chemists and other scientists are still trying to perfect.

Algae projects are most sustainable when combined with other processes, like wastewater treatment, something big companies and investors aren’t always aligned with. And beyond biology or technology, there are problems of infrastructure and policy. For algae to work, leaders and companies need to care about it.

The team at ASU, working with the city of Mesa, think they have a start on a local level. But Flory acknowledged that continued efforts of science and investment, on a local and commercial scale, will be needed to make more progress.

“It’s not something you can just flip a switch and say, we’re going to get the answer, and we’re done,” Flory said. “It takes a lot of people trying, failing, learning, (and) trying again.”

Cultivation challenges

Margarita Acedo was one of those people who wanted to keep giving algae a try. When she moved to Tucson in 2010, she had two goals.

One was to learn English, a task that took her only a few months. But the other goal was much bigger. She wanted to find better ways to cultivate microalgae to create alternative forms of energy.

Acedo, who started as a volunteer and went on to earn her master’s degree and doctorate in chemical and environmental engineering at the UA, worked at Viridos (formerly Synthetic Genomics), a California-based company that recently partnered with ExxonMobil to develop algae biofuel.

Acedo thinks the hardest part of making algae biofuels a reality will be the “transition from the lab to the field.” Before researchers can do anything with algae, they have to grow it. So Acedo has worked on projects that study the effects of light, nitrogen, heat and more on algae yields, which will be critical to understand if algae is to be grown on a commercial scale.

It might grow in water instead of a field, but she sees algae as a crop. So does Everett Eustance, an assistant research scientist at ASU who has been working with Flory on the wastewater project.

“Here (on our project at ASU), they keep track of it, make sure it’s growing healthy. You have to make sure the fertilizers and everything is correctly done just like any other farm crop,” Eustance said.

And much like farmers, algae cultivators won’t be able to control the weather. That, Acedo says, is a gap that needs to be addressed between research and reality.

“All of what we (were) producing (was) at the R&D stage,” Acedo explained of her time at Viridos, “so most of the things (algae researchers are) producing is data.""

Another decision for researchers growing algae, including Arizona teams, is whether to grow algae in environments that are open or closed to the outside world. To grow the vast amounts of algae needed to produce biofuels on a large scale, cultivators need big ponds. Smaller, closed systems tend to work well, but the size is limited, and they’re more expensive. When ponds are outside, wind could contaminate the algae or introduce dust.

“You can grow them in closed reactors, but they’re a lot more capital intensive. You need a ton of landmass to be able to cultivate enough algae to make a huge dent in your biofuels,” said Kimberly Ogden, professor and department chair of chemical and environmental engineering at UA. Ogden was Acedo’s Master’s and doctoral advisor while Acedo was a student and has been focused on biofuels and bioproducts for over a decade.

One solution to the space problem? Trying to increase the amount of oil the algae produces. Acedo says that’s a project other scientists have been working on at Viridos. Just as land-based farmers might use a genetically modified crop variety that produces higher yields, algae researchers are applying similar techniques to try to get more biofuel bang for their buck.

In the meantime, bright sunny places like California and Arizona remain important for studying algae growth.

“Arizona is a great place for (algae cultivation) because of how much sunlight we have,” Ogden said. But in the desert, water usage is a big concern. “At some point we might get a water problem, because there’s a lot of evaporation off of there.""

That’s something Flory and his team hope to address by working directly with a wastewater plant. Since the process already involves reclaimed water, it’s less of a burden on water systems.

“If you’re attaching them to wastewater treatment plants, that’s a good idea,” said Ogden, who was not involved with the ASU project.

But even with the right algae strains and the growing location set up, there’s more work to be done to make microalgae fuel viable.

Scaling up: The role of infrastructure and integration

At one of the ponds at the Mesa site, Eustance dips a gloved hand into the green water. He pulls out something that looks like a woven rug, or maybe old parchment: a square mat made up of long, white fibers connected at each end with a length of metal.

This is where the magic happens.

When the microalgae “eat” the waste from the anaerobic digesters, they do two useful things. They leave behind a purer form of methane (another type of gas) that can be pumped into existing natural gas systems as “renewable natural gas.” And they also grow more of themselves, creating “biomass,” which can eventually be converted into biodiesel or other products like fish feed or even synthetic materials used to make sneakers.

But to get that waste from the metal dome into the algae ponds, scientists need a go-between.

“They’re like little hollow drinking straws, but very small. And that lets the carbon dioxide … get delivered to the microalgae,” Flory explained. “What comes out the end of those drinking straws is the methane, which you can use as natural gas.”

The natural gas you're most familiar with is probably the kind that formed deep underground, as a result of plant and animal matter decomposing under pressure over millions of years. Extracting it often involves building deep wells or fracturing rock formations at high pressure in a process commonly called fracking.

This natural gas is different. It ultimately serves the same purpose as other natural gas, and it still emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when it’s burned for fuel, but it didn’t take millennia to form. And in this particular case, because it’s attached to a wastewater plant, it’s getting two uses out of the same greenhouse gases that would be emitted no matter what as a result of the waste in wastewater breaking down.

“It’s a way of separating the carbon dioxide from the methane and using (the methane) for a productive purpose,” Flory said.

That separation is important because methane is a particularly harmful driver of climate change. Both carbon dioxide and methane are so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and drive the warming of the planet. But methane is about 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide, according to an assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

If methane gets separated out and burned as fuel before being emitted, it breaks down and releases carbon dioxide (it’s not perfect, researchers say, but it’s a lot better than releasing methane). For that to happen, Flory says he and his team are working on making those special gas-delivery fibers more efficient. Going into the fibers, there’s about 40% carbon dioxide and 60% methane. Flory estimates that right now, by the time the algae is done with it, it’s closer to 85% methane.

Flory is aiming for an even better 97% methane.

Recent research news: 'A tipping point': Arizona universities join forces to map the deadly Valley fever fungus

It’s all part of a plan to make their system as cheap and efficient as possible. That includes reducing the energy needed to create the current needed for the algae by using the paddle wheels attached to the ponds.

To tackle those infrastructure challenges, researchers need more investment that will allow them to fine-tune a relatively new process.

“One of the biggest challenges we have compared to corn ethanol or any other terrestrial (biofuel crop)? We don’t have the existing infrastructure,” said Eustance, noting that farmers on land already had everything in place they needed to cultivate plants like corn. “Right now, it’s tricky. There’s a lot of unknowns, too, because we’re still very much (on) the small scale.”

Acedo understands why companies like ExxonMobil might be necessary to transition from that small scale to commercial-scale projects. “We need the money of an investor,” she said.

But she isn’t necessarily convinced that oil and gas companies like Exxon will be interested in integrating algae infrastructure on a local level with projects like wastewater treatment, something that Arizona researchers, both on and separate from the ASU project, agreed would be important for the highest climate impact.

Acedo described how energy companies, similar to ExxonMobil, have been cultivating large algae ponds in Europe, with what she believes is the aim of diversifying an energy portfolio commercially rather than with a focus on sustainability.

“When you are actually integrating different processes, like wastewater treatment … that’s when you make it more sustainable,” Acedo said.

Casey Norton, a spokesperson for ExxonMobil, did not answer when asked about whether the company was working on integrating processes like wastewater treatment as part of its algae biofuel strategy. Instead, he described the work with Viridos on developing genetic tools for better cultivation, as well as other biofuel projects not using algae, which some scientists have pointed out have the potential to be land-intensive and inefficient.

“Algae is one part of our portfolio approach to researching, developing and deploying lower-emissions technologies,” he said in an email.

Other bioscience news: You caught a virus and recovered. But what happens when that virus stays inside you forever?

A mindset shift

Even though some big companies might see financial green when they look at algae, Flory says he thinks most people, if they have heard of it at all, see algae as a nuisance, something that blooms in recreational areas, kills fish and generally makes life more difficult.

That hasn’t stopped scientists like him from communicating about the allure of algae as an innovative climate solution. “It’s pretty in some ways, it’s got beautiful colors to it. I think most people don’t really know much about what it is,” Flory said.

But with that beauty comes a reality: As literally green as algae may be, it will take a bigger paradigm shift for investments in algae energy to pay off, both economically and environmentally.

John Giles, the mayor of Mesa, is optimistic about the algae project, which he touts as an investment in innovation. And he thinks that innovation will be non-negotiable if climate goals are to be achieved.

“Last year, we adopted a climate action plan that is very aspirational, but also we want it to be achievable,” said Giles, noting that he believes Mesa’s plans are on par with those of cities across the world.

“We don’t know how we’re going to do this (attain climate action goals), but we’re going to set these goals and we’re going to hope the technology evolves,” he said, adding that “the technology we need to achieve these goals doesn’t exist.”

The lag between technology and implementation is a roadblock facing the energy sector as a whole and part of the reason Flory thinks biofuels will be needed to make the transition to cleaner energy sources possible.

“The reality is today we can’t easily go to 100% (renewables) because so far, we don’t have the capacity to really do that,” he said, citing technology challenges involved in storing intermittent power sources like solar and wind.

Ogden agrees that there won’t be one solution to the energy challenges of the future, and thinks “we’re a long way off from not using any carbon to do things” She noted that algae-based biofuels are of particular interest for airplanes and cargo ships, which have not yet been electrified.

Unless there’s a carbon tax or the market changes significantly, she says fossil fuels will continue to be too much cheaper than renewable sources for there to be any economic incentive for decarbonization.

That’s why Flory hopes that integrating their project with wastewater treatment, which he says has always been a burden for society as well as for the climate, will help the technology gain traction. Though wastewater treatment only accounts for 1% of Mesa’s overall carbon footprint as outlined in their climate action plan, it’s also something that society has already agreed needs to be paid for, an idea that’s been slower to catch on for carbon emissions.

“Ultimately, it comes down to, ‘is carbon dioxide emissions enough of a problem that we think we should pay for it in some regard?’” Flory said. “I think we’re going to need those (kinds) of policies and (a) mind shift to make (algae biofuels) really scalable.”

Masonry blocks from microalgae-based bio-cement offer zero carbon alternative,"Prometheus Materials is all set to decarbonise the construction industry by offering a zero-carbon alternative to the commonly used Portland cement. A leader in zero-carbon building materials, Prometheus Materials has developed a range of products manufactured using bio-cement created from naturally occurring microalgae.

“To prevent catastrophic climate change, we cannot simply replace fossil fuels with renewable forms of energy – we must also decarbonise the way we create building materials,” said Loren Burnett, co-founder, president and CEO of Prometheus Materials.

“By using biological rather than chemical means to create a strong, durable binding agent for aggregate, we can now offer a zero-carbon alternative to carbon-intensive Portland cement. Our bio-cement will transform architecture as we know it, by providing the construction industry with a new decarbonised building material that has environmental and mechanical properties that mirror or exceed the capabilities of concrete, wood, steel, and glass,” Burnett explained.

Prometheus Materials recently raised US $8 million through a Series A funding round led by Sofinnova Partners, with participation by the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), GAF, and The Autodesk Foundation.

Prometheus Materials will use the funding to commercially manufacture zero-carbon masonry units at its production facility in Longmont, Colorado. The products will be marketed to architects, engineers, property and facility developers, and others in the construction industry as an affordable, strong, and durable zero-carbon alternative to Portland cement-based concrete masonry units (commonly known as concrete blocks).

Over the next two years, Prometheus will use the funding to begin commercial production of other zero-carbon building products, including:

Precast bio-composite elements, a decarbonised alternative to traditional precast Portland cement-based roofing tiles, wall panels, sound barriers, and other concrete elements;

Ready-mix bio-composite, a decarbonised alternative to traditional Portland cement-based ready-mix concrete.

Developed under a US Department of Defense grant by a team of scientists and engineers at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Prometheus Materials’ zero-carbon building products are manufactured using naturally occurring microalgae. The patent-pending photosynthetic biocementation process combines microalgae with water, sunlight, and CO2 to create a bio-cement similar to the material that coral uses to build reefs or oysters use to generate their shells.

When mixed with aggregate, this bio-cement creates a zero-carbon building material with mechanical, physical, and thermal properties comparable or superior to the carbon-intensive Portland cement-based concrete. The product’s ability to sequester carbon during the production process results in a reduction of approximately 90% of embodied carbon compared to existing Portland-cement based products.

“Coral reefs, shells, and even the limestone we use to produce cement today show us that nature has already figured out how to bind minerals together in a strong, clever, and efficient way,” says Dr Wil Srubar III, co-founder and chief technology advisor at Prometheus Materials.

“By working with nature to use existing microalgae to bind minerals and other materials together to create new types of sustainable building materials, we can eliminate most, if not all, of the carbon emissions associated with traditional concrete-based building materials.”",,[],[]
Carbon-capture to feed startup sets up pilot plant in Denmark,"The pilot unit is located at the Danish Technological Institute (DTU) in Taastrup, Denmark. That institute has secured access to laboratories, facilities, and competencies within the microalgae cultivation area.

The idea is that Algiecel’s container-based photobioreactors, using microalgae organisms, will capture CO2 for conversion into high value commodity products such as omega-3 oils and protein to be used in food and feed products.

Juan Farré, president and CEO of the DTU, said that “the opening [of the pilot facility] marks the establishment by the Danish Technological Institute of an ecosystem giving start-up companies access to an integrated platform of testing and demonstration facilities within the space of future foods and the green transition.”​

In March, we reported that Algiecel had received funding of around £400K (US$525K) from Denmark’s BioInnovation Institute (BII) for the construction and testing of the carbon capture pilot plant.

At the launch of the pilot operations, Jens Nielsen, the CEO of BII, said he was impressed by how quickly Algiecel has advanced to this stage, that it is now initiating experiments at pilot scale. “But speed is unfortunately important as we rapidly need new technologies like the ones Algiecel is providing to make sure that we can create a sustainable society.”​

Mobile solution

The photobioreactor technology is easy to install, scale and operate, said the founder of Algiecel, Henrik Busch-Larsen, in March. He is the former CEO of single cell protein pioneer, Unibio.

As the Algiecel solution has been made mobile it can thus be installed with ease at a biogas or fermentation plant where CO2 emissions, he added. The plan would be to have several such container units installed at the one site to fully capture the carbon emitted.

Revenue-sharing concept

The startup is looking to champion a new revenue-sharing business model to offer carbon capture as a service to industrial clients.

Busch-Larsen said he started Algiecel mid-2021, with the vision of making CO2 removal cost-neutral.

He and the team have designed a business model that looks to transform the cost challenge of CO2 removal and potential emission penalties into a profitable business opportunity across the entire value chain: “Carbon emitters would need to invest in the photobioreactor but, when we start producing omega-3 oils and protein, the revenue from sales of those derivative products will be shared with the clients so, over time, the process would be cost-neutral, with clients, eventually, running a small profit off the back of their CO2 problem.”​",,[],['Jane Byrne']

Algae (both microalgae and macroalgae) produce several valuable compounds that are drawing the attention of the cosmetic industry. Algal compounds can be used in anti-aging creams, sun protection products, and skin-whitening agents. Microalgae are conventional producers of high-value bioactive products. Various organic beauty products and natural cosmetics are being made available globally. Another new development is the sustainability of the products. When introducing new products, cosmetics manufacturers have increasingly emphasized that they are produced non-harmful to the environment.

The current trend in cosmetics is developing products that meet the consumers' demand by providing multiple benefits with little or no effort.

The skincare industry uses chlorella extract because its compounds contain anti-aging, refreshing, regenerating, emollient, and anti-irritant properties. It has an active role in the cosmetic industry as the pigments/metabolites produced by these organisms enrich the beauty products.

The Impact of COVID-19 on the Algae Products Market for Cosmetics

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely hit many economies around the world. Government measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, such as nationwide lockdowns and quarantines, impacted many industries, including the personal care and cosmetic industry. Social distancing, self-isolation, and nationwide lockdowns have led to the closure of many establishments in many countries.

Story continues

The cosmetic industry is a multibillion-dollar industry that took a financial hit in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail businesses were closed, and in-store shopping, as well as salons and beauty boutiques, were shut down. Working from home, physical distancing, and mandatory wearing of the mask were some of the factors that led to reduced use of cosmetics, thereby impacting the cosmetic industry.

In the algae industry, a major slowdown in algae product sales was witnessed in the first quarter of 2020 due to disruptions in logistics & transportation. The market also witnessed disturbances in the complete value chain, from raw materials supply to production, packaging, and distribution of the final algal products. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this market were felt in China starting in 2020 (China is one of the largest producers and exporters of algae biomass & ingredients for the cosmetic industry in the world). In China, factors such as factory closures, seaweed and other microalgae processing facilities operating at reduced capacities, and restrictions on the import & export of algae biomass strongly impacted the global algae products market for cosmetics in 2020. Moreover, the pandemic also affected this market in many countries, including the U.S., India, Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, the U.K., and Spain. Due to the countrywide lockdown in India, many commercial algae production and processing facilities were shut down or operated at reduced capacities, leading to substantial losses in domestic algae production.

The algae industry in Southeast Asia also faced challenges due to the growing severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the distribution of fresh algae and its biomass within and across markets in the Asia-Pacific region. In Indonesia, the price of exported Cottonii seaweed, used for producing carrageenan (largely used in the cosmetic industry), declined by almost 50% since trade with China, the country's biggest export market.

Therefore, the global algae products market for cosmetics in 2020 and 2021 was affected worldwide by a complete halt in the transportation & logistics industry and scarcity of raw materials. The production of algae had reduced due to lockdowns in many countries.

Blackfoot pāua and micro algae 'should be used for alternative food sources',"New Fish saucisson includes free farmed pork, pāua and seaweed. NewFish is fermenting New Zealand microalgae and underutilised seafood to create food.

New Zealand has underutilised seafood sources and little understood micro algae that could be a sustainable food source for all, says a startup food company.

Hamish Howard, general manager of NewFish, said the company recently closed a $1.3 million pre-seed deal to research the viability of New Zealand micro algae as a food and nutrient source.

The company was already selling blackfoot pāua abalone saucisson to high-end markets, but wanted to produce alternative nutrient and protein sources for the masses.

Over 80% of New Zealand’s commercial blackfoot pāua harvest was heat-treated to be sterile, and then bleached to seem more edible to consumers in export markets, Howard said.

* Is precision fermentation the future for food?



“What we are trying to do is give the industry an option to move away from that process and create a unique high value added product for export. We also want to embrace whole fish utilisation and use all parts of the pāua,” Howard said.

The skirt and hua (guts) of pāua, were often used as crayfish bait or thrown away. Pāua had high value as an alternative protein source and should be used in new ways, Howard said.

“It's a lost opportunity in low value production streams.”

Robyn Edie/Stuff NZ Abalone Company's Brae Forrester and Morgan Minivannan give Stuff readers a behind-the-scenes look at their pāua farming operation in Bluff.

Howard said NewFish did not want to create alternative proteins, so consumers would stop eating animal proteins, but wanted people to consume responsibly, he said.

The company was investigating making items like fish fingers that combined undervalued fish or abalone, and micro algae, he said.

Micro algae in particular was a potential future foodstuff with potential for transitioning the food production system to a more sustainable and regenerative one, Howard said.

“Micro algae are essentially unicellular seaweed, and has huge potential as low impact foodstuffs. They grow fast from high rates of sunlight and carbon dioxide. They have a huge carbon capture potential and there are very little inputs required [to grow them],” Howard said.

supplied/Supplied Micro algae have flavour depth, high nutritional content and are a plant-based protein. Environmentally they had huge potential as a carbon sink, Hamish Howard, general manager of NewFish says.

Open ocean aquaculture was needed for seaweed, but a laboratory and precision fermentation technologies could be used to grow micro algae, Howard said.

NewFish was running a two-year project to investigate the nutritional profiles of native micro algae and its uses in its products, Howard said.

“We know there will be an increase in demand for sustainable protein in years ahead, and we hope to meet the demand. It will, to some extent be to replace proteins that come from sentient beings, in New Zealand’s case, cows.”

The micro algae held valuable proteins, amino acids, fat lipids and micronutrients. There were a number of species with different nutritional profiles that were of commercial interest, Howard said.

Primary industries often grew or farmed a high value product, only to export it without adding value. New Fish wanted to change that, Howard said.",,[],['Gerhard Uys']
A new idea for refining biocrude,"Credit: Bao et al, Frontiers of Chemical Science and Engineering (2022). DOI: 10.1007/s11705-021-2126-y

The high content of nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs) in biocrude obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae is one of the most concerning issues on the applications and environment. The biocrude obtained by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) needs further refining optimization, and the high concentration of nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds such as quinoline, pyridine, etc., will poison the catalyst used in the refining process, so that the deactivation of the catalyst will cause great difficulties in refining the biocrude. Moreover, NOCs and sulfides have a competitive relationship in the desulfurization process of biocrude, which inhibits the desulfurization effect. Although there have been many studies on tackling nitrogen-related problems and analyzing reaction mechanisms for some key reactions, there is still no complete and systematic investigation on the overall nitrogen pathway during HTL process.

Yuanyuan Shao, an associated professor from the School of Chemical Engineering and Technology at Tianjin University, and colleagues proposed to investigate the nitrogen distribution in different products and analyze the effects of reaction conditions on nitrogen distribution to explore its reaction pathway. Their study was published online in Frontiers of Chemical Science and Engineering on March 7, 2022.

""In this project, we used Chlorella sp. and Spirulina sp. as feedstock. The effects of reaction temperature, residence time and solid loading rate on the yield, nitrogen recovery and chemical compositions of biocrude were comprehensively investigated,"" said Prof. Shao. ""We also analyzed the nitrogen distribution in the aqueous phase, and a brief reaction map during the whole process was the highlight of this research.""

""We found that there were three main forms of NOCs, including nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds, amides, and amines. And there was a certain transformation relationship between them; the proportion of distribution in different products mainly depends on the reaction conditions,"" said Tianyi Bao, the first author of the paper, a Ph.D. student from the School of Chemical Engineering and Technology at Tianjin University. ""Even though the chemical compositions of the two microalgae which both belonged to high-protein low-lipid microalgae were similar, the contents and distribution of nitrogen in biocrude and aqueous phase were quite different.""

Actually, the representative of amino acids in Chlorella sp. and Spirulina sp. protein are leucine and arginine, respectively. In terms of chemical structure, leucine is a neutral amino acid while arginine is a basic amino acid. ""We inferred that more nitrogen in basic amino acids was inclined to go into the aqueous phase and existed in the forms of water-soluble NOCs,"" said Tianyi Bao. This result demonstrates that the selection of microalgae, especially the analysis of the internal protein structure, is also one of the focuses of future research.

Women in aquaculture: Jenny Soria Nina,"Peruvian Jenny Soria Nina develops technologies to facilitate the growth of the aquaculture sector. One of her recent successes is a mobile hatchery designed to produce scallops and other aquatic species.

Can you briefly describe your aquaculture career? I studied aquaculture engineering in Lima, Peru. I started my working career in 2005, researching the reproduction and culture of red sea urchin (Loxechinus albus).

Nina with the photobioreactors produced by her company, Biomarino Nina founded Biomarino, a company dedicated to the development of innovative technological aquaculture equipment for the local and international market, in 2016

After this, I had different jobs; I worked as a hatchery manager for scallop, oyster and spirulina and at the University of Piura on the production of microalgae. In 2016, I co-founded Biomarino, a company dedicated to the development of innovative technological aquaculture equipment for the local and international market. Providing solutions to real production problems, we carry out demonstrative research and apply what we have learned to increase the productivity and profitability of our clients. What drew you to aquaculture in the first place? My older sister studied international trade and always brought home magazines about fisheries and aquaculture, which I started reading. Through these articles, I learned about the possibilities of a career in aquaculture. I liked that in aquaculture there is a large variety of jobs to choose from and specialise in. I also like that a career in aquaculture gives me the opportunity to travel a lot. What species have you been working with? I have been working with several species. The first species I worked with were grey and red tilapia. I have also worked with scallops, oysters, abalone, sea urchin, shrimp, macroalgae and microalgae. What work-related achievement are you most proud of? Last year, I won a silver medal for one of our inventions at the Korea International Women’s Invention Exposition, which was organised by the Korea Women Inventors Association (KWIA). We received the prize for a mobile laboratory for the production of molluscs and other aquaculture species such as fish and shrimp. It is a portable system that is easy to install and runs on 95 percent solar energy.



Mobile laboratory for the production of molluscs and other aquaculture species Biomarino is building mobile aquaculture laboratories with high production capacities that can be deployed anywhere that has a good supply of water

It consists of two metal containers, one with the necessary equipment for spawning and assisted reproduction, including photobioreactors which allow the accelerated production of microalgae. It also houses the solar power system and electric back-up generators to use on days with little sunlight or higher energy consumption, and a water storage tank. The second container houses the culture tanks. When using seawater, the system disinfects the intake water and treats the effluent water before water is returned to the sea. The system has been tested for the production of scallops in the bay of Sechura, Peru. We are currently building a second unit with a higher production volume in the same area. However, the mobile laboratory can be used anywhere as long as there is a good supply of water.

What does a typical day in your current role consist of? In a typical day, I move between the office, the workshop and the hatchery. I work on administration and reporting, supervise the quality control of production of the system components, and supervise the entire process of culturing scallops and microalgae.

My favourite part is to follow the farming process of scallops. When, in the metamorphosis stage, a large amount of larva adheres to the substrate, which is proof of a job well done, I feel very satisfied. Jenny Soria Nina

What is your favourite part of working in aquaculture? My favourite part is to follow the farming process of scallops. When, in the metamorphosis stage, a large amount of larva adheres to the substrate, which is proof of a job well done, I feel very satisfied. What challenges have you encountered working in the sector? During my first job, I was part of a team to create a 100 percent handmade scallop hatchery on Chuncho Island in Peru – without electricity, fresh water, microscopes or air blowers. The team was very committed and we managed to produce scallop seed up to 2-3 millimetres for stocking in the sea. We replaced water using a motorised pump and used natural light to culture microalgae in fibreglass tanks. We stirred the water manually to add oxygen and counted larvae with our naked eyes. The hatchery went on to operate for two years. Have you encountered (or heard of) any gender-related challenges in the sector? In almost all my jobs that I have had, 90 percent of the professionals were men. I am always the only woman at work. Women are given less heavy – but often meticulous and critical – work. It is good that there are women who can carry out this work. But, on the other hand, professionals should know all aspects of their work and therefore women should be involved in all tasks, if they want to be.



The [aquaculture] sector is very broad and you can specialise in culturing crops, studying diseases, environmental issues, research, innovation and much more. Jenny Soria Nina

Are there any individuals or organisations in aquaculture that you’ve found particularly inspirational? The two people that I look up to are Kiyotaka Kani, a highly skilled Japanese professional specialised in shellfish farming whom I had the chance to work with back in 2005, and Dr Luis Vinatea, who is a highly qualified Peruvian specialised in intensive fish farming in land-based systems. He is a great example for me and I hope to meet him someday. What advice would you give to women who are considering joining the aquaculture sector? I would recommend that they study aquaculture, it is a beautiful career. The sector is very broad and you can specialise in culturing crops, studying diseases, environmental issues, research, innovation and much more. Women tend to be creative, detail-oriented, perfectionist and meticulous. These qualities are very important in aquaculture – especially when working on potential new species for aquaculture or research. It is important that women are represented on every team.

What’s the most unusual experience you’ve had in aquaculture? I think it was when we changed the algae culture medium for a culture medium containing fishmeal. This was a mistake, after three days it smelled terribly and we had to go into the lab to stop the culture and clean everything, a very unpleasant job! If you could solve one issue in aquaculture what would it be? Improving the quality of water used for aquaculture. Only with high water quality can we produce healthy animals in intensive or super-intensive systems. Water management processes must be improved regardless of the species. Over the years, it has been proven that the quality of seawater and rivers is declining. This means that we must keep optimising our water treatment processes, especially if we want to increase stocking densities and volumes. At Biomarino, we have patented an industrial processor for the sterilisation of seawater, with high efficiency and low energy consumption. Water is sterilised using a magnetic induction system and rapidly cooled by thermos-electric plates.

What species that you’ve worked with do you think is the most promising for aquaculture? I believe that to ensure food security in the world, tilapia is the most important species since it adapts very well to different environmental conditions, is very strong, grows fast and has good yields. Because farming tilapia is easy and less demanding compared to other species, it can be adopted by many people. Another promising group of species is microalgae. These can be cultured in super-intensive photobioreactors. Microalgae products is used as food, food additives, pharmaceuticals, and in the future, they could replace fishmeal and soybean meal. What would you like to be doing in 10 years’ time? I would like to be changing the entire process of traditional aquaculture to automated and digitised production systems to increase the sustainability of the products, reduce labour efforts and lower production costs.",,[],['Kyra Hoevenaars']
Mukesh Ambani's RIL to make biofuel out of algae soon; check details here,"Mumbai-headquartered energy to telecom bellwether Reliance Industries (RIL) announced that it will be making fuel using algae soon. RIL confirmed the development in an Instagram post.

The company handle shared a 51-second-long video clip of the same and wrote, “Fuel from algae? You heard that right! Our scientists have developed cutting-edge innovative capabilities for algae strain development, cultivation, and harvesting. This has unlocked endless possibilities such as the production of biofuel, bio-chemicals and nutritional food and feed.”

The post further read, “RIL is innovating in green and renewable energy sources to keep pace with India’s fast-growing energy needs.” It further stated that these innovations are reflective of RIL’s commitment to meeting India’s energy requirements and doing this in a sustainable way so that India can meet its UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Reliance Industries is not the only company to talk about making biofuels. Earlier this year, energy giant ExxonMobil announced that it is committed to attain net-zero ambitions by building on its 2030 emission-reduction plans. These plans include net-zero emissions for Permian Basin operations and investments in lower-emission solutions including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuel, as per a press release dated January 18.

Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil Darren Woods said, “We believe our strategy is unique among industry and enables us to succeed across multiple scenarios. We will create shareholder value by adjusting investments between our existing low-cost portfolio and new lower-emission business opportunities to match the pace of energy transition.”

But how do scientists convert tiny plants like algae into fuel? According to Harvard Political Review, scientists usually grow microalgae in large, open ponds or enclosed photobioreactors. At scale, the microalgae need to grow in open air.

After this, scientists harvest algae, break down cell walls using chemical solvent and extract inner lipids, proteins and carbs. Inner lipids, proteins and carbs then undergo final processing which turns them into biofuel.

Meanwhile, Reliance Industries shares are 1.42 per cent down at 2,625 apiece on the BSE, as of 3:24 pm.",,[],[]
Biofuel: how new microalgae technologies can hasten the end of our reliance on oil,"Microalgae have been used by the Chinese for medicinal and nutritional purposes for thousands of years in the belief they could cure almost any health condition. The idea that microalgae have extraordinary healing powers isn’t as far-fetched as some might think. Though the ancient Chinese believed the microalgae was responsible for health-improving benefits, we now know that it was in fact the biochemical compounds produced by these microscopic creatures that provided the “magic”.

There are approximately 100,000 species of microalgae, each with their own distinct set of properties. This diversity allows microalgae to flourish in almost every environment on Earth. Mostly they exist in aquatic habitats such as fresh or wastewater, but they have been found in moist soil – and even snowbanks too.

Microalgae are usually described as being green, and this is true for species such as B. braunii and C. vulgaris. But there are other species, such as C. officinalis, which is red or F. spiralis, which is brown. Each classification produces different types or quantities of biochemical compounds, making some more useful for certain applications than others.

Over the past few decades research has demonstrated the huge potential of microalgae, especially in the production of biofuel – fuel that is created from plant material or animal waste. I wanted to review this research to provide a framework to establish the most suitable microalgae species for large-scale biofuel production that can ultimately rival oil and gas giants and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

The magic of micoalgae

Microalgae have a unique ability to convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into a wide range of biochemical compounds. Despite being classed as animals, they metabolise the same way as plants, producing oxygen to replenish what we humans consume. This cycle acts as a carbon capture system, whereby harmful CO₂ in the atmosphere is converted to useful oxygen. Microalgae also produce a wide range of other compounds found inside the cells, and these are what make microalgae so good at combating the effects of global warming.

Generally, the products from microalgae can be grouped into three classes: proteins, carbohydrates and lipids (fats). But research has found that there are several other high-value biochemical compounds that have significant applications in a wide range of different industries. For example, microalgae produce compounds known as carotenoids, more commonly known as dyes or pigments. These compounds are responsible for giving salmon its pink colour, as the food they eat contains high quantities of carotenoids.

Another high-value class of compounds are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). These compounds are part of the lipid family and play a vital role in supplying the cells with energy. Microalgae have been deemed one of the richest sources of these compounds, which help treat the effects of diabetes and arthritis.

But how is it possible for these organisms to produce oil that can be used in cars? The petrol and diesel currently used is derived from crude oil that was formed millions of years ago from dead sea creatures. But modern biofuel is produced from living organisms on a real-time basis.

How biofuel is produced

Biofuel made from microalgae is currently one of the most promising fossil fuel alternatives to sustain the world’s energy demand. This is no easy task, especially having to compete with a highly profitable industry that has been established for more than a century. But unlike oil, which is non-renewable, biofuel is a renewable and sustainable source of fuel. Unfortunately, the economics of biofuel can’t yet compete with traditional fossil fuels. It all boils down to the bottom line, and currently the scale-up technology required isn’t here yet.

Microalgae don’t directly produce biofuel – they produce lipids (fats). To make biofuel these fats must be converted through a process known as transesterification. The process involves removing as much water as possible, known as dewatering, but this requires significant amounts of energy, resulting in high operating costs. As a result, the overall process becomes too expensive to compete with the oil and gas industry, despite its positive environmental impact.

Economics aside, the future for microalgae cultivation and lipid extraction is extremely promising. The development of hybrid technologies will accelerate the global shift to reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. These include cell factories that use gold nanoparticles – subatomic particles similar to atoms that form the building blocks of physical matter – to increase production rates and increase efficiencies.

Another potential solution is a process known as “milking”. Traditional cultivation methods for microalgae mean they are destroyed after the cultivation period has ended, which limits the full potential of what each cell can offer. Just like milking a cow, the process can be repeated without killing the cow, and the same goes for microalgae. By repeatedly removing high-value compounds from the same culture of microalgae, the high production cost issues can be removed, resulting in a sustainable and scalable process for the future.

This would result in biofuel becoming cost competitive with current fossil fuels, helping to accelerate the shift towards alternative energy sources. Unfortunately, the prospect of competitive biofuel production has some way to go before it can rival fossil fuel prices and quantities. But these developing technologies have the potential to speed up the transition needed to help the world reach its 2050 emissions targets.",,[],['Callum Russell']

The global EPA & DHA market is projected to grow at the CAGR of 8. 26% during the forecast period (2020 - 2025). Globally, EPA and DHA have been gaining importance and are becoming a part of the consumer’s daily diet.

New York, June 14, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""EPA & DHA Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2022 - 2027)"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06241300/?utm_source=GNW

The key reasons for this change have been the increased prevalence of lifestyle diseases and people taking preventive healthcare measures. Moreover, the emerging applications of EPA and DHA in food, dietary supplements, and clinical nutrition have been further stimulating market growth.



New sources of EPA and DHA have been hitting the headlines recently. Microalgae, a source rich in omega-3 and beta-carotene, has gained immense popularity among the manufacturers as a sustainable source of food and fuel.



By application, dietary supplements continued to claim its dominance in the industry with constant support provided by health ministries and regulatory bodies for its promotion. The increasing number of product approvals, comprising EPA and DHA as major ingredients by the FDA, have enabled more dietary supplement manufacturers to enter into the market studied, further aiding the overall market studied.



In 2019, FDA approved the health claims for EPA and DHA omega-3 consumption in the labeling of conventional foods and dietary supplements, about reducing the risk of hypertension and coronary heart disease.



Key Market Trends



Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) Dominated the Market byType



The DHA segment is majorly driven by the rising demand and its incorporation in infant formulae and nutritional products targeting children’s health, as it is an essential building block for the growth and maturation of an infant’s brain and retina. It is mostly obtained from fish and algae oils. Additionally, it is extensively used in fortified foods and dietary supplements, where it is majorly used for treating Type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), dementia, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The healthy aging-related benefits of DHA have also led to their successful utilization in geriatric nutrition products. Furthermore, an increasing number of product launches across the world is favoring the industry growth. For instance, Organic Technologies, in 2017, launched two new DHA omega-3 concentrates to its line of AlaskOmega fish oils and concentrates—a high DHA concentrate, and a medium strength DHA (non-tuna) tuna oil alternative.



North America Dominated the EPA & DHA Market



The North America EPA and DHA ingredients market is primarily driven by innovations, both, in products and technologies. The leading players are investing in technological advancements, in order to get develop improved omega ingredients for wider applications. In October 2016, DSM launched a new process technology, 3C technology. The technology aids the manufacturers of omega-3 to produce highly concentrated ingredients (up to 85%). It also facilitates the manufacturers to customize the combinations of EPA and DHA for their application in pharmaceutical and dietary supplements. The trend of consumption of supplements instead of functional food is predominant in the region. Consumers prefer high concentrated dietary supplements to meet their nutritional requirements of DHA/EPA. Thus, driving the ingredient sector’s growth in the region.



Competitive Landscape



The global EPA and DHA market was moderately concentrated by few players, such as BASF SE, Croda International PLC, and Koninklijke DSM NV in 2019. Many small companies started commercial production of EPA and DHA, only to be acquired by larger players as a competitive strategy for major companies are focussing on investment in research and development to compete in the emerging market. Moreover, during the last few years, various global companies have become active in the global EPA and DHA market with tactical acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships. For instance, in 2017, Veramaris (established 50:50 joint venture between DSM & Evonik) in order to produce omega-3 fatty acids (containing rich amounts of EPA and DHA) derived from natural marine algae for animal nutrition. The other major players in the market are forming partnerships with different end-user industries, such as food and beverage, dietary supplements, and others primarily due to the increasing demand for sustainably sourced Omega-3 fortified food products as well as dietary supplements.

"In the neighborhood of microalgae, location is key to bacterial carbon use","A schematic diagram showing the concept of a porous microplate, where microalgae and bacteria can be cultured in wells at different distances from one another and can exchange nutrients and metabolites without physical contact. Credit: Hyungseok Kim / Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Microscopic algae are responsible for half of the global atmospheric carbon fixed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, and may be used as a sustainable bioenergy source.

The water immediately outside their cells, called the ""phycosphere,"" is rich with algal-excreted organic carbon, and is an ideal ecosystem for bacterial growth. However, detecting and measuring bacterial cell activity and population growth in the phycosphere has been difficult, because it has not been possible to track single bacteria and their locations in relation to algal cells over the course of an algal population growth cycle.

But scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and collaborators have created a new co-culture device, dubbed a ""porous microplate,"" to figure out how the phycosphere structures bacterial communities. The nanoporous copolymer allows cell metabolite exchange while blocking physical contact between adjacent culture wells.

""This design enabled the stretching out of the phycosphere in both space and time, which made it possible to quantify bacterial growth and community structure changes at different distances from the algal cells,"" said Xavier Mayali, LLNL scientist and co-author of a paper appearing in the International Society of Microbial Ecology Journal (ISME Journal).

The team showed that algal-associated bacteria grew faster when placed closer to the algal culture well, as might be expected in the real phycosphere environment.

After sequencing the algal microbiome DNA cultured in the microplate, the team revealed that certain bacteria responded to the algal production of organic carbon in a spatially dependent manner, with some bacteria adapted to living close to the algal cells and others adapted to living further away. This is analogous to buying an expensive house close to the supermarket so getting food is easier, versus buying a cheaper house further away. This concept has important implications to understanding how microbes process organic carbon in aquatic environments, which controls whether carbon is sequestered or respired back into the atmosphere as CO 2 .

An additional and unexpected result is that cultivation of the diatom Phaeodactylum in the microplate led to yields 20 times greater than batch cultures due to continuous supplementation of nutrients through the hydrogel. This finding may have a fundamental impact on efforts for increased and more efficient algal biomass production at large scales.

""The system shows that the algal phycosphere is a complex ecosystem, which allows multiple microbial groups to thrive in different locations within this microscale environment,"" Mayali said.

Other LLNL contributors include Jeffrey Kimbrel and Jessica Wollard as well as researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

"First came ‘Red Tide’, now a warning in Bahía de Banderas for ‘Green Tide’","After the presence for several months of red tide in the waters of Banderas Bay (Cabo Corrientes and Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco and Banderas Bay, Nayarit), which has left thousands of dead fish on the beaches, researchers from the University of Guadalajara now detected green tide.

María del Carmen Cortés Lara, Master of Science and researcher at the University Center of the Coast, of the University of Guadalajara, announced that for five months they have been monitoring the blooming of algae within the Bay of Banderas.

Thanks to the Bahía de Banderas-CUCosta-UdeG Red Tides Monitoring Program, which has been carried out since 2000, there is a historical database and record of scientific activities related to algae blooms, in such a way that in what so far this year, they have detected 4 to 6 blooms of algae, better known as red tide, caused by different species in the bay.

“During the month of May, we observed a bloom of algae, but now as a green tide, and in the laboratory we have identified the microalgae (Eutriptiella), creating a quite considerable stain; which is why it is important for the population in general to take precautions,” warned Cortés Lara.

The researcher recommended avoiding swimming in areas where the patches are visible, that is, where a higher concentration of this microalgae is observed. Unfortunately, it has been possible to observe dead fish in these areas.

In addition, it is important that the general population does not collect fish from the sea, much less consume them. Also do not give them to pets, as food. Researchers have observed people collecting fish around the bay for food; however, it is not suitable for human health.

The green tide has currently been observed south of Banderas Bay, especially off the coast of Yelapa, municipality of Cabo Corrientes, where it has been around for a month. Although also, in front of the Islas Marietas National Park in Bahía de Banderas, Nayarit.

‘Microalgae could be cultivated on Mars’: Experts detail less obvious benefits of algae production,"By 2050, it is estimated global populations will reach around 9.8bn. With so many mouths to feed, and an agri-food system that accounts for one-quarter of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, entrepreneurs are on the hunt for food sources that champion both human and planetary health.

An increasing number believe they have found it in algae. Some in macroalgae (or seaweed), and others in microalgae, which unlikely the former, is largely invisible to the eye.

Algae cultivation has some very obvious sustainability benefits, particularly concerning its reliance – or lack there for – on limited natural resources. When grown in the ocean, it does not require any fresh water and is not in competition with landbound crops. It is also cultivated without inputs such as fertiliser or pesticide.

And when microalgae are grown in tanks on land, reliance on natural resources is minimal compared to conventional livestock rearing or crop cultivation.

But there are more sustainability benefits that may be less obvious to the general consumer, suggested entrepreneurs at ProVeg Incubator and Zinitinus’ Future Food Series event last week.

Producing algae-based protein on Mars​

For one, microalgae needn’t be cultivated near the oceans at all. In fact, cultivation systems can be installed in some of the most unlikely places around the planet…and even further afield.

What VP at the European Algae Biomass Association Alexandra Mosch finds particularly ‘cool’ about microalgae production, is that it can grow in closed photobioreactors (PBRs) or open ponds in non-arable areas, such as deserts.

“This means they can also be grown in buildings or on rooftops, or be integrated like…vertical farms,” ​Mosch, who is also an advisory board member at algae supplier Allmicroalgae, told delegates. This could also prove beneficial in terms of food miles, she suggested, since that the majority of people around the world now live in cities.

Given the adaptability of microalgae production systems, it could even be conceived that microalgae-based foods be produced in some of the most desolate landscapes, suggested Eugene Wang, CEO of Singapore-based Sophie’s BioNutrients​.

The start-up, which is in the process of expanding its presence in the Netherlands, ferments microalgae in bioreactors, isolates their proteins, and transforms them into a powder for food formulation.

“It may happen that when Elon Musk wants to shoot people over to Mars, we can potentially set up our technology…system on Mars – identical to the one that we’re going to set up in Europe – and produce protein out of microalgae.​

“Why? Because where there is water, there is going to be microalgae,” ​he explained. “And we can use the microalgae on that planet to [create] food for the new settlers on that new planet.​

“This may be too extreme [a concept] for a lot of folks, but I’m just trying to point out the fact that you don’t really have to be affected by global warming or the weather, and you don’t need a lot of space. You can just use fermentation technology.” ​

How can algae address nitrification?​

Another advantage of algae production, is that when managed correctly, it has the potential to reduce the impact of challenging environmental problems.

Nitrogen and phosphorous pollution is one such issue, with human activities – including excessive fertiliser use in conventional farming – largely to blame.

As nitrogen and phosphorous in the water encourage algae to grow, water systems can quickly become overrun, resulting in algal blooms. Algal blooms can be toxic, and have been known to kill fish, mammals and birds.

But is there a way for nitrogen and phosphorous pollution to be leveraged for good? Tel Aviv University spin-off Genesea​, which is making protein isolates and other ingredients for plant-based food manufacture from offshore marine macroalgae, is investigating a solution.

“We need nitrogen for seaweed to grow,” ​explained co-founder Alex Golberg. “So one of the first things we did, a few years ago, was to create a global map of locations where there are…both natural nutrients coming up from the bottom of the ocean to the surface, and nutrification – where…fertilisers wash off from agriculture to the sea.”​

These are areas Genesea predicts could prove fertile for seaweed farming.

Golberg also stressed the relevance of ocean currents. “We knew that any type of nutrient that you put [in the sea] will immediately disperse somewhere else. So you need to locate the farm in an area where the current [transports] the nutrient supply.”​

In a similar vein, Jacob von Manteuffel, co-founder of German brands BettaF!sh and Nordic Oceanfruit​ – which both use ocean-cultivated seaweed in their food products – sees this as a ‘huge opportunity’ to close the cycle.

“A large amount of the phosphates and nitrates that we put into our agricultural systems end up in the ocean and it’s a huge waste of resources. It has some very bad impacts on our ecosystem in the ocean, and by cultivating seaweed, we have the possibility to close the cycle and gain back nutrients we really can’t afford to lose right now.”​

Do we need to make seaweed cultivation more sustainable?​

There is some concern that ocean-cultivated algae will not be the silver bullet many hope it will be. Growing seaweed can, indeed, create environmental problems in the oceans when high density cultivation causes biomass degradation and methane production.

“It can actually convert into a big swamp in the middle of the ocean. This could happen,” ​said Genesea’s Golberg.

However, there are ‘a lot’ of projects underway, by the European Union and others, to explore how seaweed can be grown in a sure-fire environmentally friendly way. “Meaning that there will be enough light available to all other organisms that live here.” ​

One solution could be to build cases that allow sufficient amounts of light into the ocean, the co-founder continued. “All these are real problems that exist, and the communities are aware of them and the solutions are coming.”​

Is seaweed farming at risk of significantly harming the environment? GettyImages/Kanawa_Studio

Is seaweed farming at risk of significantly harming the environment in this way anytime soon? BettaF!sh and Nordic Oceanfruit’s von Manteuffel is not convinced.

“We are destroying our oceans globally, taking people’s resources by massive fishing fleets…and then we calculate if seaweed farming could at some point speculatively have a negative impact. That’s hypocrisy…​

“Seaweed farming is very small still and there is huge potential. It’s far from being harmful…”​",,[],['Flora Southey']
"Global Meat Analogs Protein Ingredients Market Analysis/Opportunity Report 2021: Animal Welfare, Sustainability, and Health Concerns Amidst a Global Pandemic Fuel Investment and Innovations","DUBLIN, June 2, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The ""Global Meat Analogs Protein Ingredients Growth Opportunities"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Research_and_Markets_Logo

This report assesses the opportunity across the global meat analogs protein ingredients market from 2017 to 2026. Among the different plant protein ingredients, soy protein accounted for the highest share in 2020.

However, rising demand for clean-label, non-GMO, non-allergenic protein ingredients will drive demand for soy and wheat protein alternatives such as pea protein. Chickpea and fava beans are also seeing increased uptake in the meat analogs space.

Meat alternatives or meat analogs are defined as products obtained through alternative protein ingredients such as plant protein or microbial protein; they can mimic the taste, texture, and cooking qualities of animal-derived meat products. The growing number of flexitarians will continue to be a key driver of global meat analog industry growth. Millennials will also drive the shift to healthy and sustainable diets.



Other factors expected to fuel adoption include the rising environmental and health concerns among consumers. As consumers gain awareness of the environmental impact of animal-derived food products, demand for sustainable alternative protein sources will rise. The use of sustainable production technologies (fermentation techniques to produce single-cell proteins (SCPs) such as mycoprotein, which can be used to produce meat alternatives) is also gaining momentum.



As sustainability becomes an important determinant for new-generation consumers, opportunities for microbial or cell-cultured proteins will expand. Fungal and algae are the key types of microbial proteins being explored. Among the fungal proteins, mycoprotein is expected to witness strong growth over the forecast period, with some of the major companies projected to offer the ingredient on a much larger scale over the next 2-5 years.

Story continues

Microalgae whole biomass protein is another alternative that holds significant growth opportunity, provided companies can overcome the color and the flavor challenges associated with its use in meat analogs. Spirulina and chlorella are the key microalgae species being used; however, the industry is also exploring other micro and macroalgae species for application in meat and seafood analogs.



Geographically, North America and Europe accounted for a combined high share (they drove the bulk of the ingredient demand). However, Asia-Pacific is expected to become the hotspot of the plant-based meat revolution over the next 5-10 years. China, Singapore, Southeast Asian countries, and Australia and New Zealand will drive most of the ingredient demand. Latin America and the Middle East are also expected to witness strong penetration of plant-based meat analogs during the forecast period, fuelling protein ingredient growth in these regions.



In terms of competitive environment, the plant protein ingredient category is dominated by global and regional manufacturers (Chinese companies hold a significant share in the soy protein ingredient space). Value chain consolidation is a prevalent trend as companies are looking to move up the supply chain through organic and inorganic growth strategies.

Start-ups also want to offer microbial protein for meat analog applications; however, only a few well-established brands exist, including Quorn Foods, Corbion, and Duplaco. Partnerships between microbial protein manufacturers and product formulators such as Nestle and Unilever are testament to the high growth opportunity in this space.

Sederma Invests in Synthetic Biology for Cosmetic Actives,"For nearly six decades, Sederma has been one of the world leaders in creating and producing cosmetic active ingredients. A multinational supplier to the global beauty industry, Sederma develops and produces ingredients coming from chemistry, as well as fermentation and plant cell culture. Many of Sederma’s ingredients are derived from plants and microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, microalgae, fungi.For the past several years, Sederma has invested in synthetic biology, a combination of biology, bioinformatics and engineering. Sederma is part of Croda International, Plc.Happi recently spoke with Denise Gabriele, vice president, sales & marketing, Sederma, Inc. , to learn more about synthetic biology and its uses in skin care and other personal care products.Happi: Why synthetic biology?Sederma’s focuses are multiple, and mainly related to sustainability and how we can use “Smart science to improve lives,” as stated by Croda’s purpose. With this in mind, we are working to reach some specific targets and the targets fixed by Croda to be Climate, Land and People positive by 2030.Innovation is part of our DNA. We’ve created some of the most well-known and efficacious ingredient in the industry, some of which come from chemistry, like our peptides, and others are from nature through extraction processes, biotechnologies, such as fermentation and plant cell culture. We are driven by sustainability and how we can improve our practices to reduce our environmental impact. Our goal with synthetic biology is to develop production alternatives for some molecules that are currently made by chemistry. To sum up, what we expect from this nature-based high technology is to develop a new approach of augmented biology.Happi: What do your customers want from this technology? What do consumers expect from this technology?Many of our customers, as well as consumers, are concerned with sustainability and are looking for eco-friendly, natural derived ingredients. For the cometic industry, this technology can provide more sustainable ingredient solutions to fulfil their needs. It can even allow for the production of new innovative molecules. Nature is amazing and produces molecules that are very difficult to synthesize by chemistry. Even if we don’t want to replace all the chemistry, our objective is to use the best technology to reduce our overall impact on nature.Happi: What are the specific sustainability benefits of synthetic biology?They are obviously numerous! First, synthetic biology is an alternative to chemical synthesis enabling us to avoid the use of solvents, undesired residual molecules. It also allows the synthesis of molecules that can’t be produced by organic chemistry. So, the goal with synthetic biology is to develop production alternatives for some molecules that are currently made by chemistry. It can also help us improve some of the processes, save time, improve yields, and reduce some consumption and costs.Happi: What materials or classes of materials look most promising for synthetic biology and why?Synthetic biology can be used to develop many useful systems for humans, such as therapeutics, biofuels and in our case, cosmetic active ingredients.This pure innovation would enable tailor-made bioproduction of recombinant proteins and peptides, antioxidants, pigments, UV filters, biomaterials, polysaccharides, with new and/or optimized abilities. The possibilities are limitless!Synthetic biology is a combination between biology, bio-informatics and engineering. The principle is to build and develop biological systems that do not exist in nature, or re-build existing systems by modifying them. The concept is to use (bio) bricks that are standardized and able to be put together to fulfil a function.Happi: Has Sederma launched any ingredients created via biotechnology?We have not yet launched any products from this technology, but plan to soon. We applied this mindset to two current projects: peptide and ceramide production. Sederma has so far invested five years working on synthetic biology. The developments are on-going. As we work with living organisms, nature can sometimes be difficult to work with. Some of the projects are close to industrial scale-up and we expect to launch a product, from this augmented nature technology, within a couple of years.About Denise GabrieleDenise Gabriele is the Vice President of Sales & Marketing of Sederma, Inc., the bioactive division of Croda International Plc.

Airborne microalgal and cyanobacterial diversity and composition during rain events in the southern Baltic Sea region,"This research focuses on the quantitative and qualitative analyses of cyanobacteria and microalgae present in rainfall during the summer phytoplankton bloom season of August–September 2019. In addition, a continuous episode of rainfall over several days was selected to demonstrate the washout process of microorganisms from the air with rain.

Quantity of cyanobacteria and microalgae washed out with rain during the growing season

Currently, there is a growing number of scientific articles on cyanobacteria and microalgae in the atmosphere8. Unfortunately, there is a reference methodology for efficiently counting the microorganisms present in the air or in rainfall. A popular method for quantifying cyanobacteria and microalgae in the air is to show the number of taxa found in the collected samples after growth6,31,42,43,44,45,46. In this study, a total of 16 taxa of airborne cyanobacteria and microalgae were found in the samples. In the rainwater samples obtained during the summer of 2019, 11 taxa of cyanobacteria and microalgae were distinguished. The green algae in the rainwater samples included Bracteacoccus sp., Oocystis sp., Coenochloris sp., Chlorella sp., and Chlorococcum sp., while the cyanobacteria included Leptolyngbya sp., Pseudanabaena sp., Synechococcus sp., and Synechocystis sp. In addition, Chrysochromulina sp., which belongs to Haptophyta, was observed.

Other studies recorded the presence of several to several dozen taxa in the air6,31,42,43,44,45,46. Certainly, a number of factors, starting with atmospheric conditions and ending with physical and chemical parameters of the surrounding waters, influence the diversity of cyanobacteria and microalgae in the atmospheric air. Analyzing global trends, only cyanobacteria have been found in the atmosphere of every region of the world31. However, according to Dillon et al.47, cyanobacteria have been detected in clouds at variable abundances between ~ 1% and 50% of the total microbial community. Xu et al.48 found that cyanobacteria constituted only 1.1% of the total bacterial community in clouds. It needs to be highlighted that there is still a lack of research available to provide this type of information for rainfall samples.

For the period from July to September 2019, the results showed that the number of cyanobacteria and microalgae cells present in rainfall varied over time (Fig. 1) and ranged between 100 cells L–1 and 342.2 × 103 cells L–1. From July to the end of August, the cell number was relatively low, ranging from 100 cells L–1 to 28.6 × 103 cells L–1. This variability was related to the change in the biomass of blue green algae in the Gulf of Gdańsk (Table S2; Fig. 1). Therefore, this research also shows the close relationship between the processes taking place in the Baltic Sea and the presence of cyanobacteria and microalgae in the atmosphere. As the biomass of cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea increased, the number of cyanobacteria and microalgae cells in the rainfall samples also increased (***p < 0.001). This result may be representative of the dominant number of cyanobacteria cells in the rainfall over the Bay of Gdańsk. Based on the data from the hydrodynamic model (http://model.ocean.univ.gda.pl/) for the Bay of Gdańsk, intense increases in the biomasses of cyanobacteria and total phytoplankton in seawater were recorded at the beginning of September 2019 (Fig. 1). Moreover, when analyzing the meteorological conditions, the sudden increase in the biomass of cyanobacteria and microalgae in seawater could have been related to the relatively low wind speeds (mean of 1.3 m s–1 over a few days) and the highest air temperature (up to 31.2 °C on September 1) in the analyzed period (*p < 0.05 for air temperature). The influence of atmospheric pressure was also an important factor (***p < 0.001). It is known that the presence of cyanobacteria and microalgae in air, and subsequently in rainfall, is strongly related to the changes occurring in nearby seawater8. Moreover, the results of the present study revealed a high Spearman correlation between the number of cyanobacteria and microalgae cells in the rainwater samples and the NO 3 – concentration of seawater (*p < 0.05) (Table S3). Therefore, these studies indirectly indicated that the processes leading to increased blooms in water bodies, with particular emphasis on blooms of toxic organisms, significantly affected the air quality in this region and could also influence the health of its citizens.

Quality of cyanobacteria and microalgae washed out with rain during the growing season

Many studies have described the species composition of cyanobacteria and microalgae present in the atmosphere2,4,6,12,13,14,16,42,43,46,49,50. However, research on how these organisms are removed with precipitation from the atmosphere is still lacking. To the best of our knowledge, only Dillon et al.47 have reported on the number of microorganism taxa present in rain. Green algae of Trebouxiophyceae and cyanobacteria of Xenococcaceae were predominant in rainwater samples taken at the Opme meteorological station in France47. The authors classified the cyanobacteria in their rainwater samples as Phormidiaceae, Rivulariaceae, and Nostocaceae and the orders Pseudanabaenales and Synechococcales. Among the genre of green microalgae, Chlorella sp. was often observed by Dillon et al.47. Regardless of being in aerosols or rainwater, cyanobacteria and green algae have been found to be the dominant organisms8,47. Similar conclusions can be drawn from the results of the present study. In addition to cyanobacteria and green algae, Chrysochromulina sp. and Gymnodinium sp. were observed in the air aerosol samples during dry periods; however, they were not present in the subsequent rainfall samples. Differences in taxonomic composition between clouds and rainfall were reported by Dillon et al.47. Accordingly, we concluded that differences may exist between the taxonomic composition of aerosol and rain samples. Thus, in our opinion, there is a need for future in-depth research on the physics of microalgal and cyanobacterial particles removed from the air and clouds that would explain the exact reason why some organisms are washed out faster than others.

Among the microalgae and cyanobacteria present in the air, Genitsaris et al.2 distinguished those that have been shown to be harmful to human health once inhaled. These organisms can cause allergies, skin irritation, hay fever, rhinitis, and respiratory problems and may produce toxins. Several harmful taxa, such as Chlorococcum sp., Oocystis sp., Anabaena sp., Leptolyngbya sp., Nodularia sp., Pseudanabaena sp., Synechococcus sp., Synechocystis sp., and Gymnodinium sp., were observed in our study. However, on the one hand, presence in rainwater implies a successful purification process, but on the other hand, washout might result in the colonization of new regions. The origin of organisms in rainwater is related to their transport over marine waters, freshwater reservoirs, and terrestrial areas. According to Olenina51, most of the detected microalgae and cyanobacteria in rainwater and aerosol samples are typical of those in the Baltic Sea. Among them, we distinguished Chlorella sp., Coenochloris sp., Oocystis sp., Anabaena sp., Leptolyngbya sp., Nodularia sp., Pseudanabaena sp., Synechococcus sp., Synechocystis sp., Gymnodinium sp., and Chrysochromulina sp. According to Guiry and Guiry52, Bracteacoccus sp. and Coccomyxa sp. are freshwater and/or terrestrial taxa, while Chlorococcum sp. is a cosmopolitan taxon. Coccomyxa sp. has been previously found in air samples from the Baltic Sea region29. Bracteacoccus sp. and Chlorococcum sp. were isolated by Mikhailyuk et al.53 from biological soil crusts of maritime sand dunes of the Baltic Sea. In many respects, the Baltic is similar to an inland lake or an estuary and is unique because there are areas where freshwater, brackish water, and marine species are all present. Hence, the cyanobacteria and microalgae that we collected at our sampling station may have different salinity preferences. Wiśniewska et al.29 presented a detailed analysis of the salinity preferences of cyanobacteria and microalgae isolated from air samples.

Cyanobacteria and microalgae washed out from the air: a case study

Although bacteria have been well studied, research in the area of airborne cyanobacterial and microalgal washout appears to be limited. The particular difficulty of this research is that it is impossible to plan a period of rainfall in advance. As there was no such period during the seasonal sampling in 2019, we performed additional measurements from August 27 to September 2, 2020, when there was almost daily intermittent rainfall. Aerosol samples were collected before and after each rainfall episode, and the qualitative and quantitative compositions of cyanobacteria and microalgae were determined in both sets of samples. In the rainwater samples, the observed cyanobacteria included Anabaena sp., Synechococcus sp., Leptolyngbya sp., and Nodularia sp., while the observed green algae included Ankistrodesmus sp., Oocystis sp., and Stichococcus sp. In the aerosol samples, the representative cyanobacteria were Nodularia sp. and Synechococcus sp., while the observed green algae included Ankistrodesmus sp., Chlorella sp., Chlorococcum sp., Oocystis sp., and Stichococcus sp. Gymnodimium sp. (Miozoa) and Chrysochromulina sp. (Haptophyta) were also observed in the aerosol samples. In the rain samples, 400–5000 cells L–1 were recorded during this period, whereas only 0.6–11.2 cells m–3 were measured in the aerosol samples (i.e., three orders of magnitude lower). The number of cyanobacteria and microalgae cells in the aerosols was comparable to that reported by Tormo et al.54 for samples collected in southwest Spain (0.18–3.85 cells m–3). The authors also found that the daily concentrations of microalgae and cyanobacteria in their air samples were positively correlated with temperature and wind speed and negatively correlated with rainfall and relative humidity.

The present research primarily aims to determine whether the presence of rainfall, as well as the number of microalgae and cyanobacteria cells recorded in it, influenced the number of cyanobacteria and microalgae cells in the air (Fig. 2). The results showed that the number of cyanobacteria and microalgae cells in the aerosol samples decreased by 21–87% after each rainfall event (relative to that prior to rainfall). The only exception was on August 27, when the number of microalgae cells increased significantly in the aerosol samples despite previous rainfall (Fig. 2D). On this day, sea air masses from the central Baltic Sea were transported over the measurement station (Fig. S1). The influx of air masses above the sea surface could have been associated with an increase in the microalgae and cyanobacteria taxa in the aerosol samples6. With the exception of this case, the largest decrease was 87% on August 29 (Fig. 2F), when the air mass trajectory after the period of rainfall changed from the north (carrying sea air masses) to the south (carrying inland air masses). A significant decrease (64%) in the number of microalgae and cyanobacteria cells in the aerosol samples was also observed after a period of rainfall lasting more than a day (Fig. 2G). This study is the first to discuss the effectiveness of the washing out of cyanobacteria and microalgae from the atmosphere with rain. It would be interesting to conduct similar types of research in other regions of the world, where the presence of cyanobacteria and microalgae, especially those that are harmful to human health, has also been demonstrated.

To date, the results obtained in this study can be compared only to the washing out of bacteria from the atmosphere. Research on washout conducted by Ouyang et al.55 showed that rainfall could remove up to 40% of bacteria from the atmosphere. However, we are not aware of any data in the literature regarding the washout efficiency of microalgae from the atmosphere. It should be noted that the number of microalgae and cyanobacteria cells present in rainwater does not necessarily mean that the cyanobacteria and microalgae that were in the air before the rainfall event were effectively removed. There was a case where a significant number of microalgae cells was found in a rainfall sample, but no decrease in the microalgae content of the aerosol sample was observed (Fig. 2D). This result may have been due to the continuous supply of cyanobacteria and microalgae from the sea, especially during strong phytoplankton blooms.

Dillon et al.47 found that cyanobacteria and microalgae were also present in clouds; thus, the microorganisms present in rainwater not only came from the aerosols present in the surrounding air but also could be washed out from clouds. Therefore, the taxonomic composition of rainwater and clouds47 may differ from that of aerosols. Most of the research on the washout of particles in air with rain has focused on bacteria. Joung et al.56 found that the amount of bacteria in the air after rainfall may significantly change. As a result of raindrops colliding with a substrate, bioaerosols can be re-emitted from the substrate to the air56. In the present study, an analysis of the taxonomic composition before and after periods of rainfall was also performed. Only on one occasion did the composition of the rainwater sample fully reflect the composition of the aerosol sample taken before the rainfall event, when Synechococcus sp. was observed in both samples (Fig. 3). There were no cases of a specific taxon being completely removed from the air by the rainfall event; however, for rainfall events lasting more than 24 h, Synechococcus sp. was completely washed out with the rain. This could have been related to the almost daily change in the direction of the air mass trajectory, whereby other taxa of microorganisms may have been supplied from slightly different source regions. Other studies have confirmed that the presence of new microalgae in a sample can be associated with a change in the air mass flowing over the measurement station6,31.

Figure 3 Number of microalgae and cyanobacteria cells in air samples before (BR) and after rainfall (AR) and in rainwater samples (R) on the morning of August 25, 2020 (A), the afternoon of August 25, 2020 (B), on August 26, 2020 (C), at noon on August 27, 2020 (D), in the evening on August 27, 2020 (E), on August 28, 2020 (F), from August 30 to September 1, 2020 (including 2 d of rainfall) (G) (left panel), and examples of microalgae and cyanobacteria collected from dry and wet deposition samples (right panel). Full size image

An interesting case was recorded after the rainfall event on August 27 (Fig. 3D), when the highest number of algae cells and the highest number of taxa were recorded in the rainwater sample. It is particularly interesting that Nodularia cf. harveyana was found in the rainwater sample because it was not observed in the aerosol samples before the rain, but it was found in the aerosol sample after the rainfall event. This result may suggest that, as in the case of bacteria, the re-emission of previously deposited particles could occur during intense rainfall57. Joung et al.56 found that when raindrops collided with soil, 0.01% of the total bacteria were emitted back into the air. Therefore, in the case of an increase in the amount of cyanobacteria and microalgae in the air, the re-emission of particles from the soil after rain should also be taken into consideration. However, this topic requires further detailed investigation. Additionally, after the rainfall event on August 27, two different species of Nodularia were recorded, as shown in Fig. 3D.

This research on washing out cyanobacteria and microalgae from the atmosphere by rain is pioneering and, therefore, definitely needs to be continued. We hope that our measurements will significantly influence the development of research on these organisms. In addition, it seems to be necessary to more extensively investigate the presence of cyanobacteria and microalgae in rain in different parts of the world. It would be advisable to learn more about the spatial variability and temporal variability of cyanobacteria and microalgae in rain. Our measurements were conducted for a relatively long time but only at one station. We would recommend further research on airborne cyanobacteria and microalgae regarding how they are washed out from the air at different kinds of research stations and at varying distances from the sea, both during the growing and the nonvegetative seasons. Information on airborne cyanobacteria, microalgae, and bacteria is summarized in Table S4.",,[],"['Wiśniewska', 'Kinga A.', 'Division Of Marine Chemistry', 'Environmental Protection', 'Institute Of Oceanography', 'University Of Gdańsk', 'Gdynia', 'Śliwińska-Wilczewska', 'Division Of Marine Ecosystems Functioning', 'Lewandowska']"
What foods will 9.3 billion people be eating in 2050?,"Over the next few decades, the fate of the world’s food supply will largely be shaped by a number: 9.3 billion. That’s the projected global population for 2050. By then, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that the world needs to have boosted food production by 60% to meet demand.

Where will those extra calories come from? The answer will likely require new approaches to food production.

Land and climate: Agriculture currently uses about 40% of the world’s land and is responsible for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. It’s possible to clear vast swaths of tropical forests and other areas to make new agricultural land, as nations did at an unprecedented rate throughout the 20th century.

But doing so would exacerbate global warming in two ways: creating more sources of greenhouse gas emissions (such as methane from cattle) and destroying trees, which absorb carbon while alive and release it when felled.

Rethinking the food supply: Feeding a growing population sustainably will require both improving the efficiency of conventional agriculture and inventing new ways to make food.

On the conventional agricultural side, many commercial farmers are already employing methods to increase yield while minimizing environmental destruction, such as using efficient irrigation systems, tailoring fertilizer blends to certain crops and soils, utilizing computers to better apply pesticides and herbicides, and feeding cattle food supplements to lower their methane output.

As for new food production techniques, the future is wide open. Vertical farmers are growing crops indoors, using computers to monitor plant health and efficiently administer food, water, and light. Cell-cultured meat producers are growing real animal meat in labs, all without killing animals. And aquafarmers are growing nutrient-rich kelp and microalgaes, both in natural ecosystems and in bioreactors.

As the 20th century shows, the food supply isn’t fixed — and it can transform quickly. Here are some foods, new and old, that might make it on menus by 2050.

Cell-cultured meat: Grown in a lab, cell-cultured meat isn’t a plant-based meat alternative — it’s real meat.

The process works by extracting a healthy culture of cells from an animal, and then placing those cells into a bioreactor where they can grow and multiply into tissue. After a couple of weeks, the lab-grown meat can be shaped into familiar products, like burgers or chicken nuggets.

While there remain questions about the nutritional value of cell-cultured meat, it’s definitely got the upper hand on the ethics side. The fact that it doesn’t require slaughtering animals also means that the industry could offer some exotic foods, such as lab-grown tiger meat, which one startup may soon start selling.

Plant-based meat alternatives: Companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have sent the plant-based meat alternatives booming over the past decade. One reason these companies have shot to prominence is that they appeal to both vegetarians and carnivores alike by mimicking the taste, look, and texture of real meat products.

But the future of plant-based foods could also pack entirely new flavors. In 2020, Big Think asked Impossible Foods CEO Patrick O. Brown whether the company had considered creating plant-based dishes that bring new flavors and concepts to the table instead of foods that simply mimic familiar meat products.

“Oh absolutely, and this is something internally, and in our [research and development] team, we love to think about,” Brown said.

Traci Des Jardins, a chef and culinary advisor to Impossible Foods, said creating new plant-based dishes would be something like the vegetarian’s answer to the hot dog (in concept, not taste):

“I can imagine products that we could create at Impossible that would be amazing things that could become as iconic as the hot dog,” she told Big Think. “Because a hot dog really means nothing. It’s just a name that’s been attributed to this thing that goes in this bun. And so, I think there are many, many possibilities, and that we could create all kinds of delicious things that don’t have the environmental impact that animal-produced meats have.”

Legumes: Legumes — whose edible seeds are called pulses — are responsible for all of the world’s beans, lentils, and peas. Pulses are cheap and packed with protein and B vitamins.

But one of the reasons these plants are likely to play an increasingly important role in the global food supply is their sustainability. Legumes can grow in a wide variety of climates and, unlike most modern crops, they don’t require nitrogen fertilizers. In fact, most legumes (famously, peanuts) actually improve soil quality.

There are more than 16,000 legume species in the world, though only a small number are produced at large scales.

The vast genetic diversity of legumes means they could have nutritional benefits currently unknown to scientists, and likely species that have yet to be discovered.

Jellyfish: Jellyfish have been eaten as part of Asian cuisine for centuries. But the invertebrates, of which there are more than 20 edible species, could soon start showing up on Western menus, likely in the form of dried chips or as a cold, pickled product.

Low in fat and rich in protein and minerals, jellyfish pack many of the same health benefits as other fish, but they’re not endangered. In fact, jellyfish populations have been thriving as waters warm, positioning them as an especially sustainable seafood option.

Insects: Nearly 2 billion people worldwide eat insects, a practice known as entomophagy. Sure, the idea of snacking on deep-fried grasshoppers is a hard sell, especially for consumers in Western nations.

But when it comes to farming efficiency, insects outperform just about every other animal because the cold-blooded critters are extremely easy to raise and are far more efficient at converting their feed into protein than common livestock.

Edible insects are often touted as a “food of the future” and the market is projected to grow significantly throughout the decade. But for insects to become a common dish outside of African and Asian nations, marketers will have to figure out how to shift norms enough to rid entomophagy of its stigma in the West. In the meantime, some insect farmers are having a go at raising them for animal feed.

Algae: Kelp, which is a macroalgae, is not only rich in antioxidants and elements like iodine but also one of the most sustainable crops. After all, seaweeds like kelp require no feed and, because they grow through photosynthesis, they capture carbon that enters the oceans from greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.

People have been eating edible seaweed for centuries, particularly in Japan, where it was once such a common crop that the government allowed people to pay taxes with it. In recent years, aquafarmers in the U.S. have been ramping up seaweed production, with some startups now selling kelp-based burgers, jerky, chips, and pasta.

Beyond macroalgae like seaweeds, microalgae could also soon play a bigger role in the food supply. Microalgae pack similar health benefits to their larger, multicellular counterparts, but they can be grown more easily indoors within photobioreactors.

There are more than 30,000 documented microalgae species, though only a handful are currently used for food, health supplements, and pharmaceuticals. Future research could uncover additional health benefits or new ways to produce algaes.

When it comes to microalgae as a food, the idea is to use it as a supplementary ingredient (like microalgae powder that’s the base ingredient for pasta noodles) rather than eating microalgae alone.

Overhauling the food supply: Feeding the world’s growing population in a sustainable way is a mammoth task, but it wouldn’t be the first time society has radically transformed its approach to food production.

In 1900, the world population was roughly 1.7 billion people — a number that would more than triple over the next century. To feed that booming population, the 20th century saw innovations that drastically increased the efficiency of food production, including the introduction of fuel-powered farm machinery, the Haber-Bosch process of producing nitrogen fertilizer from the air, highly productive hybrid maize, selective animal and plant breeding, and genetically modified crops.

Altogether, these innovations helped the food supply grow more quickly than demand during the latter half of the century, reducing global hunger and malnutrition, although hunger was and is still a problem in developing nations.

But while productive, the changes to food production in the 20th century had some negative consequences: processed food became ubiquitous, producers cleared hundreds of millions of hectares for agricultural land, industrial farming practices caused widespread soil degradation, sugar intake spiked, and people (especially in Western nations) began consuming far more calories, mainly from flour and grains and fats and oils.

Today, we have a better sense of how food affects health and the environment, not to mention better technology to improve its production. For the food producers that want to break with the more destructive practices of the 20th century, the overall goal is to make food that’s nutritious, affordable, and sustainably produced.

Still, even the healthiest and most sustainable kelp chip will fall flat if nobody likes it. The most important goal? Make it taste good.

Mexico’s pink lagoon: The ecological danger lurking behind the tourist attraction,"Strange things began to happen a few years ago in La Escobilla lagoon, on the Mexican coast of Oaxaca. Stupefied snook and snappers swam around disoriented, and the locals could just stick their hands in the water to catch them. Then bloated mojarras and popoyotes (also known as the Chiapas killifish) began to wash up on shore smelling strongly of sulfur.

The biggest shock was yet to come. In early May, everyone who came to the lagoon did a double-take: the water had turned pink. Hericel Ramírez, a 28-year-old guide, went for his daily morning run and then headed to the lagoon, a 40-hectare (100 acres) stretch of water separated from the sea by a sand barrier. He got there and was stunned by what he saw. “Oh no! Why is it like this?” He couldn’t believe it. Ramírez, who works at a nearby sea turtle sanctuary, timidly stuck his hand in the water and noticed that it was warmer than normal. He decided not to taste it, thinking that maybe someone had spilled a toxic substance in the water. “The lagoon had never turned pink before. I took videos to send to some specialists,” he tells EL PAÍS by phone.

Biologists and students from the University of the Sea (Universidad del Mar - UMAR) in the Oaxacan city of Puerto Escondido rushed to La Escobilla, a community of two dozen houses scattered between the road and the waves. They took water samples for laboratory analysis and quickly ruled out a toxic spill. The researchers believe that persistent drought and lack of rain have stimulated the production of pink pigments by bacteria and microalgae in the water.

The phenomenon is well known. La Escobilla is the third coastal lagoon in the state of Oaxaca to turn pink in the last six years. In 2016, it happened in Coyula, which is part of a protected wetland area, and also in 2019, in Manialtepec. The first time it happened, locals muttered about biblical plagues, and biologist Eugenio Villanueva, a member of the Huatulco Clean Beaches Committee, had to come and provide a scientific explanation. “We told everyone that while it may look pretty, it’s really a sign of pollution and ecological stress,” he explains. “But it’s still a shock when it happens, even though those of us that work in environmental science immediately recognized the cause.”

The underlying problem is drought. The rainy season is now shorter, and rainfall is more infrequent. Some of the rivers that feed the coastal lagoons have become seasonal waterways, or have dried up altogether. The entire Oaxacan coast is yellow on the Mexican government’s drought maps, designating it as “abnormally dry.” Only the Yucatan peninsula, Tabasco, and some small pockets of Mexico are not in a drought.

Hericel Ramírez says that La Escobilla lagoon was 10 meters deep during his father’s lifetime. Now, it’s usually only a meter and a half deep, and gets up to five meters during the rainy season. “We’ve had very little rain for the last five years. It might rain for three days, and then nothing for the next month and a half,” says Ramírez. The mouth of the lagoon doesn’t open into the sea anymore since its water level is so low in the fall, so the lagoon water is never replenished.

Compounding the problems produced by the lack of precipitation are high temperatures that cause more evaporation and increase salinity. “The outflow of water by evaporation is greater than the inflow from rivers and the sea,” says biologist Nieves Trujillo, who teaches at UMAR and has studied the phenomenon since it first appeared in 2016. “This increases salinity to around 45 units, which is very high. Normal salinity for an ocean is 30 units.”

As salinity increases, the microalgae in the lagoon activate a kind of defense mechanism that produces an orange pigment. Over time, the microalgae are displaced by halophilic bacteria that like the high salt concentration, and these produce a red pigment. Under extreme conditions such as those at La Escobilla, the entire lagoon is permeated by the red pigment, which looks pink on the surface. “Salt concentration and light intensity cause these microorganisms to become stressed and react this way,” explains Trujillo.

The fish in the lagoon die due to the low oxygen levels of the water, also caused by high salinity. The crocodiles simply change their diet – instead of fish, they eat carrion. However, storks and roseate spoonbills no longer flock to the lagoon because there is nothing left to feed on. Local fishermen now have to go out into the open ocean to fish. “The lagoon used to feed the community, but there has been no fishing for two years. The few fish that remained have all been caught and the rest died,” says Hericel Ramírez.

The tourism boom in this area of Oaxaca, invigorated by two international airports within 100 kilometers (62 miles), is requiring more and more resources. The highway that runs along the coast and past La Escobilla is being widened, another obstacle for the rivers that carry freshwater to the coastal lagoons. People that live along the tributary streams are extracting sand and gravel to use in construction. “The systems are degrading at a high rate,” says Villanueva. “To restore the lagoon, it would have to be dredged, and the freshwater streams that feed the lagoon would have to be cleaned up.”

However, the two root causes of the problem – lack of rain and temperature increases – are beyond the capabilities of any well-meaning biologist. Like Coyula, the La Escobilla lagoon also runs the risk of drying up completely. “I wish we could open up the hydrant and replenish the lagoon with seawater,” says Trujillo. “If we have another year of drought, these types of phenomena are going to last longer or become permanent.”

Meanwhile, the community of La Escobilla is determined to make the best of a bad situation. The lagoon has run out of fish, but its bright pink color has attracted local and international tourists. Word has spread and they are coming to see if what they read on social media is true. And, of course, to take pictures, despite scientists’ warnings that the striking color is a sign that something is wrong in the ecosystem. To take advantage of this sudden interest, the town’s festival committee has begun to control access to the lagoon and ask for voluntary contributions from visitors. It is not yet sea turtle nesting season – a big tourist attraction for the town – and the pink lagoon can provide an additional source of income.

No one knows how long this will all last. Biologists say that the color will fade when the rains start. A brief shower fell on the lagoon recently, but it’s still bright pink. The community is praying that it will last a little longer. Just in case, Hericel Ramírez walks to the lagoon every morning to make sure. “If it goes back to the way it was, it won’t be a tourist attraction anymore, and there’s not a single edible fish left to catch,” he says. “The only thing to do is make the most of the tourists.”

Phycocyanin Pigment from Microalgae Biofilms Cultured on Wastewater,"New research published in Frontiers in Energy Research has demonstrated a process for cultivating microalgae biofilms in photobioreactors to produce these commercially important chemicals using wastewater.

Phycocyanin pigments are vital for multiple industries, having various important commercial applications. Producing them from gas and oil wastewater presents a sustainable waste valorization process that fits the aims of the circular economy concept.

Phycocyanin

Phycocyanin, along with allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin, is a pigment-protein complex. It is a water-soluble light-harvesting phycobiliprotein with a characteristic light blue color and is an accessory pigment to chlorophyll. Phycocyanins are produced by cyanobacteria.

There are numerous commercial and scientific uses of phycocyanin. It is used as a natural food coloring, in nutritional supplements (for example, spirulina,) as a coloring in cosmetics, and as fluorescent markers in immunological assays. It is also used in animal feeds and aquaculture. Additionally, it contains anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and antiviral properties, making it an attractive target for therapeutics and drugs within the biomedical industry.

Using Petrochemical Wastewater for Microalgae Culture

The petrochemical industries produce large volumes of wastewater globally as a result of oil and gas extraction. Over 90% is re-injected into formations or disposal wells for recovery. Treatment ponds are used to store most of the remaining wastewater. If disposed of untreated into the environment, wastewater can cause significant levels of pollution, affecting vulnerable ecosystems.

Using produced wastewater for the cultivation of algae is a huge opportunity for the valorization of waste streams in the oil and gas industries. This can be used for nutrient recovery, with the biomass used for beneficial purposes. A 2017 study has found that whilst produced wastewater has high salinity and organic compounds that are detrimental for algae growth, important inorganic nutrients which microbes use for growth are present, which is advantageous. Produced wastewater can therefore be used as a culture medium.

Additionally, there are indications that using produced wastewater for microalgal cultivation can be used for biofuel production as well as microbial wastewater treatment. Another recent study has demonstrated the possibility of utilizing microalgal cultivation for nutrient removal.

The majority of current investigations into using produced wastewater as a microalgae cultivation medium have focused on using microalgal biofilms for biofuel production. Conversely, there is limited research into the production of valuable bioproducts. Integrating side streams of valuable bioproducts into processes using microalgal biorefineries could help reduce the costs associated with microalgal wastewater treatment and biofuel production.

The recovery of phycobiliproteins such as phycocyanin and their derivative products can be easily integrated into microalgae biorefinery operations, and the water solubility of phycobiliproteins means that they do not interfere with the recovery of denser liquids. Thus, integrating them into these operations can optimize operations and add value to them.

Suitable substrates for microalgae biofilm growth have been identified in the current literature, with over 15 different materials so far explored. Cotton-based materials have been identified as the best-performing options.

The Study

The main purpose of the new study published online in Frontiers in Energy Research is to evaluate the influence of growth materials and light intensity in a rotating algae biofilm reactor on phycocyanin production. LLC2, a strain of cyanobacteria, was chosen for its ability to form biofilms in different light and substrate conditions. High levels of turbidity and good solid biomass production were identified as key factors in the choice of the reactor for the study.

The team constructed a 2000-liter outdoor-produced water pond at Utah State University. The pool was operated between August and September due to favorable outdoor temperature and the pond was shaded to control light intensity. Out of the materials tested for biofilm growth substratum, the cotton rope was identified as the best option.

Amongst the experimental observations in the study, low light LLC2 biofilms produced twice the amount of phycocyanin per biomass yield compared to high light biofilms. An accompanying crude extract purity (just above the benchmark standard for food-grade phycocyanin) was observed. The authors concluded that different production goals could be achieved by adjusting the light level for biofilm culture.

Based on their experimental observations, the authors have stated that future studies should concentrate on producing other high-value products from microalgae cultures in produced wastewater. Additionally, amongst other future research directions suggested in the study, the potential value of cyanobacteria biofilms to produce valuable bioproducts such as fertilizer, feed, biofuels, and biogas should be assessed in studies.

Biodiesel: The Future of Alternative Fuels

Excessive usage of petroleum products has resulted in global warming, depletion of natural resources of petroleum, and gasoline price fluctuations.

As a result, there is a significant need for substitute biofuels to replace petroleum-derived resources. The minimal total emissions, recyclability, and accessibility at controllable costs are all distinguishing characteristics of alternative fuels.

Biodiesel, which is created from waste oils, animal fats, and vegetable oils, is a completely sustainable and non-toxic fuel source that has acquired widespread popularity worldwide.

Biodiesel is described as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) generated from the esterification reaction of oil and methanol. Because of its non-toxic composition, environmental friendliness, fewer carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen pollutants, lower organic chemicals, and low particulates, it has become a potential alternative for fossil fuels in recent times.

Production of Biodiesels from Microalgae

Microalgae is a third-generation substrate with a high-fat content, fast-growth speed, capacity to collect and absorb carbon dioxide, and growth on barren terrain. Because of their comparatively high lipid content and quick biomass development, microalgae have long been acknowledged as potentially viable resources for biofuel generation.

Microalgae grow much faster than cultivated crops, and algal mass culture may be carried out on non-arable soils utilizing non-potable salty water and wastewater. As a result, academics, businesses and the general public are increasingly interested in using microalgae as an additional biodiesel source.

Role of Nanocatalysts in Biodiesel Production from Microalgae

Previous research has identified nanocatalysts as a viable way of producing biodiesel from microalgae. This is due to the fact that nanocatalytic esterification may be carried out at room temperature to accelerate the process of biodiesel production.

Nanocatalysts offer various benefits over standard biodiesel catalysts, including high catalytic activity, outstanding specificity, and optimal yield. Because of the ease and speed with which catalysts may be recovered from reaction mixtures, heterogeneous catalysts' processes seem to be more realistic for biodiesel generation.

Comparative Analysis of Two Nanocatalysts

In this study, the impregnation process was utilized by the researchers to manufacture two distinct nanocatalysts for the synthesis of biodiesel from microalgae, calcium methoxide Ca(OCH 3 ) 2 and lithium-ion impregnated calcium oxide (LIICO).

The two nanocatalysts' physical and spectroscopic properties were compared using characterization methods such as X-ray crystallography, scanning electron microscopy, BET surface morphology measurement, and FT-IR. Finally, biodiesel was created utilizing T. indica microalgae by nano catalyst-based esterification reaction, and the yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was compared.

Key Findings of the SEM Analysis Study

The SEM analysis revealed that nanoparticles formed in oval/hexagonal and floral forms. With a larger surface area, the catalyst demonstrated the highest basic strength and optimum behavior toward microalgal esterification reaction.

After 21 days, the highest biomass output of 1200 mg/L was obtained. The research discovered that under ideal circumstances, the FAME production of biodiesel utilizing two different nanocatalysts in the transesterification method was 93 percent and 99 percent, respectively.

The researchers observed that nanocatalysts may dramatically decrease energy consumption and waste generation, which was previously connected with the usage of conventional catalysts, which are typically unprofitable, time-consuming, and energy-consuming. Furthermore, nanocatalysts improve the active surface area, boosting esterification reaction and FAME production.

Future Perspectives of Producing Biodiesel from Microalgae

Microalgae have a competitive edge because of their quick, persistent development capabilities and fatty acid profile. Therefore, they are useful for fuel generation and, unlike vegetable oils, do not jeopardize food and nutrition security.

Microalgal-based biodiesel production may be combined with municipal wastewater clean-up to reduce the nutrient burden and heavy metal concentrations.

Because of their high reaction rates, nanocatalysts are expected to improve biodiesel characteristics even further. Thus, biodiesel has a broader use in terms of both economics and the environment, and it may be used in automobiles, trains, airplanes, heating oil, recovering oil spills, and turbines.

Study backs benefits of LED lighting in microalgae cultivation,"The new study by researchers at CCMAR, in collaboration with Greencolab, Necton and Allmicroalgae has looked into new methods to increase the production of microalgae, in line with rising demand.



Until recently, microalgae were produced in open production systems. However, although this method is cheaper, it also has more disadvantages, one of them being poor light distribution.

To address this problem, CCMAR studied the impact and costs of integrating LED in outdoor raceway ponds. The researchers found that the use of LEDs in cultures of the microalgae Nannochloropsis oceanica increased biomass growth, especially during the night. In addition, they found that the protein and carbohydrate content also increased in the cultures that were under LED exposure. This research presents the possibility to optimise the process of microalgae production at an industrial scale.

However, they add that the incorporation of this type of light should be mainly considered for the production of high-value algal products, since it represents an additional cost in the production of biomass.",,[],[]
Could Microalgae Be a More Sustainable Palm Oil Substitute?,"Palm oil is one of the world's most common ingredients since it's cheap, easy to grow, and versatile. But the versatility of this ingredient comes at a steep price. Palm oil production is responsible for a devastating impact on the environment, including deforestation, excessive water usage, and direct threats to endangered species across South America and Asia. Plus, high in saturated fat, palm oil is terrible for your heart health. But researchers may have found a viable substitute: microalgae.

A team of researchers at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore published a study in the Journal of Applied Phycology that claims that oil from microalgae could work as a healthier, more sustainable substitute for palm oil. The team proposed that microalgae –created by photosynthesizing microorganisms that live in salt or freshwater – would greatly minimize the environmental damages by replacing dependence on palm oil.

Despite calls for a boycott, palm oil is still the most common oil vegetable oil used on the planet. In 2020 alone, over 73 million tons of palm oil were consumed globally. That's because it's cheaper than most other foods to grow: The plant that makes it, the African oil palm, can produce up to 10 times more oil per hectare than soybeans

Health benefits of microalgae

The researchers also found that microalgae would be significantly healthier than palm oil, which has 7 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, or about the same amount as butter. Saturated fat has been linked to heart disease, a higher risk of strokes, and other chronic diseases, including inflammation and type 2 diabetes. The only oil that is worse is coconut oil which has 12 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon. Healthier oils include olive (with just 1.9 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon) and avocado which has 1.6 grams per tablespoon).

The microalgae contain more polyunsaturated fatty acids which are known to reduce cholesterol levels. Algae oil has a higher level of monounsaturated fats than most other cooking oils (these are the good kinds of fats that are heat stable.) Just one tablespoon of algae oil gives you roughly 13 grams of monounsaturated fat, which is equal to one avocado.

The microalgae-based oil also contains about 4 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, or one-third coconut and roughly half what palm oil has. These tropical oils have been linked to higher rates of stroke and heart disease, whereas microalgae-based, with its healthy fat profile, could potentially have the opposite effect.

“Developing these plant-based oils from algae is yet another triumph for NTU Singapore as we look to find successful ways to tackle problems in the agri-food-tech chain, especially those that have an adverse impact on the environment,"" Director of NTU's Food Science and Technology Program William Chen DSc. said. “Uncovering this as a potential human food source is an opportunity to lessen the impact the food supply chain has on our planet.”

To conduct this experiment, the NTU researchers partnered with another team from the University of Malaya in Malaysia. Together, the coalition developed microalgae oil that could potentially replace palm oil as an ingredient across multiple categories. The researchers proved the oil would be suitable for edible applications, claiming that it could have widespread benefits for the agri-food-tech industry.

Palm oil is an ingredient found in nearly half of all consumer products. Estimates show that farmers produced 77 million tons of palm oil in 2018, and expected the number to rise to 107.6 million tonnes by 2024. While efforts to boycott palm oil have surfaced in recent years, many activists are stunted by the firm grasp palm oil has on the market. The NTU researchers aim to find a substitute that is more affordable than the industry could potentially adopt.

“Our solution is a three-pronged approach to solving three pressing issues,"" Chen said. ""We are capitalizing on the concept of establishing a circular economy, finding uses for would-be waste products, and re-injecting them into the food chain. In this case, we rely on one of nature’s key processes, fermentation, to convert that organic matter into nutrient-rich solutions, which could be used to cultivate algae, which not only reduces our reliance on palm oil but keeps carbon out of the atmosphere.”

The researcher's efforts will potentially curb the need for palm oil in products and lessen its impact on climate change. The tests are proving that microalgae are far more sustainable since they can be grown in most underwater environments. The naturally regenerative source would have less impact on the environment compared to palm oil production. Microalgae oil could be an answer to the fight to preserve biodiversity.

Speaking Algae: Tapping the Ancient Power of Microalgae Using Synthetic Biology,"Albert Einstein famously said, “the only source of knowledge is experience.”



What if we take this principle to an extreme—say, millions or even billions of years of experience living on Earth? What knowledge might be available?



We don’t need to guess. We can look to microalgae, some of the oldest and “most experienced” organisms on our planet.



But, this begs the question, how do humans tap into microalgae’s “life experience” to acquire valuable knowledge? To do so, we must learn to speak their “language” and translate that information into useful applications for society and its industries. Amazingly, recent strides in microalgae biotechnology, synthetic biology, and biomanufacturing are making that possible.

During their time on the planet, microalgae have been busy. Given hundreds of millions of years of experimentation, microalgae evolved the genetic and biochemical skill sets needed to survive and colonize nearly every type of ecosystem on Earth, including some of the most inhospitable, 1 like the highly saline environment of the Dead Sea. 2 The continuous evolution needed to master the planet’s many ecosystems drove the creation of an impressive diversity of microalgae species, with conservative estimates landing around 70,000 3 species and others reaching 200,000 to several million.Through natural selection, each species became fine-tuned to their specific light conditions and available resources. Each species also ultimately developed unique natural product profiles and metabolic characteristics, turning light and CO2 into specific organic materials needed for their survival.While microalgae have been used in food and nutrition worldwide for centuries,it wasn’t until the middle of the 20th century that scientists began exploring the application of microalgae in biotechnology. Researchers realized that microalgae could be used as a sustainable, photosynthesis-powered expression chassis.The first successful example occurred in the 1980s when commercial groups culturedto produce β-carotene,a nutraceutical supplement that the body converts to vitamin A. We now know that microalgae species can produce a variety of high-value materials, like pigments, flavors, fragrances, growth factors, fatty acids, antioxidants, oligosaccharides, proteins, terpenes, amino acids, peptides, and many more materials desired by key industries. Until recently, the vast majority of algae biotechnology attention and funding focused on biofuel production, with limited commercial success. 7 By the 2000s and early 2010s, biofuel researchers were captivated by microalgae’s ability to produce biomass enriched with a diverse collection of high energy molecules, such as long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.However, specific technological challenges precluded commercial success. Biofuel producers struggled to increase microalgae cultivation to commercial scales while maintaining rapid growth rates, photosynthetic efficiency, ideal metabolic profiles, and algae stability. 9 While exploring untapped microalgae diversity to find a more fit-to-purpose expression chassis could resolve some of these challenges, the data mining, characterization, selection, and development of new species was often too time and labor-intensive. As a result, biofuel producers largely focused on a small subset of known microalgae species, which narrowed the collective vision of microalgae applications.Furthermore, microalgae cultivated in large-scale, open-air pond systems were prone to contamination and inconsistent production. Unfortunately, more tightly-controlled production processes using photo-bioreactors were also not viable at that time, particularly when it came to their light source. 9 While microalgae biofuels still have potential, these challenges indicate that it is time to consider microalgae as an expression chassis for a wider range of materials, particularly those required at smaller scales than biofuels. Propelled by findings from biofuel research, organizations are now realizing the rich opportunities of using microalgae to produce high value low volume products. 10 Discoveries of commercial relevance will grow exponentially as more microalgae species are characterized, since only a small number (~15) are grown at meaningful commercial scales today.In just the past few years, advanced synthetic biology approaches have made the discovery and mapping of microalgae species and their industry- and molecule-specific potential much more efficient and purpose-driven.In addition to improved recombinant gene transfer and genome editing techniques, 12 the exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have made large dataset management and analysis much faster and less labor-intensive.In turn, this enables better metabolic profile modeling, providing more accurate predictions of each species’ ability to produce a specific material. Now, individuals seeking biomanufactured alternatives to specific chemically synthesized materials can more readily seek out a species naturally primed to produce it or a related precursor.These advancements have also enabled better characterization of these species and their specific cultivation requirements. Thus, researchers can more quickly identify the optimal conditions that enable specific microalgae to grow rapidly and produce their target molecules.Tapping into the bioproduction capabilities of microalgae species also requires new advanced manufacturing technology to solve microalgae’s historic scale-up challenges.Most importantly, the past decade of algae research has cemented that light conditions massively impact algae growth, gene expression, and biomaterial production on a species-specific basis. Light is the primary medium by which microalgae interact with their environment. So, to tap into the natural diversity of microalgae, we must speak algae using light as our language.All microalgae maintain intricate light-sensing systems, made up of a network of photoreceptors and associated signaling pathways. 14 These photoreceptors control different biological functions and regulate specific gene expression to help algae respond to changing environmental conditions. Having evolved in very different ecosystems, these photosystems vary significantly between species, as do their photoreceptors and thefunctions they control. 15 Thus, biomanufacturers must understand how this complex network of photoreceptors functions for each species. With the ability to carefully tune photosynthesis, biomanufacturers can control microalgae growth, development, and biomaterial expression to suit their needs. Importantly, AI and synthetic biology approaches also help researchers determine and augment both ideal light conditions as well as conditions that impact the production of valuable organic materials and recombinant gene expression across species.To make use of algae's special relationship with light, biomanufacturers needed photo-bioreactors capable of providing high-intensity light across a variety of specific wavelengths and illumination periods. Up until a few years ago, this was virtually impossible at commercial scales. However, recent advances in LED technology now enable more advanced photo-bioreactor approaches, 16 solving their past challenges. While once restricted to specific wavelengths, LEDs can now produce light across a much wider spectrum.Additionally, LEDs are now also much more efficient, smaller, and cheaper, 18 which drastically increases their commercial viability in bioreactors. Together, these LED advancements make it possible to construct ideal light conditions for specific algae species without limitations regarding photo-bioreactor design and operation expenses.While improved lighting is the most important technological advancement, sufficiently protecting the fragile structures of microalgae remained another persistent scale-up challenge. 19 New bioreactor approaches and culture strategies have also helped to increase microalgae stability during biomanufacturing. Furthermore, the advancement of computational fluid dynamics has increased our ability to predict and understand light penetration in water, gas transfer efficiency, and fluid flow to better protect fragile algae species which historically have been difficult to grow. 20 In combination with LED advancements, this means commercially viable photo-bioreactors are now possible and available, opening up greater scale opportunities.The massive untapped diversity of microalgae species represents an outstanding opportunity to produce important materials by building on evolutionary experience. Though relatively few microalgae species have been fully explored and characterized, several efforts are underway to bring more species online. Having a greater understanding of these species is already yielding dividends, especially when paired with end-to-end biomanufacturing approaches.The microalgae biotechnology community has learned from the challenges of the past and is now ready to make microalgae bioproduction commonplace across many industries, including pharma, biopharma, animal health, agriculture, food and beverage, energy, and beyond. Despite having only a measly 200,000 years under our belt, human experience has its merits too. With this cumulative knowledge, the future of microalgae is at least LED-bright.

BioMar moves microalgae out of the niche ingredient category,"BioMar’s facility in Brande, Denmark has significantly scaled up the inclusion level of microalgae in their raw material portfolio – allowing the company to improve on its sustainability metrics and reduce dependence on wild fish stocks in aquafeed.

The research and development on algae-based ingredients in BioMar dates back in 2013 © Algared

Expanding its extensive raw material portfolio is one of the most important cornerstones for pioneering innovation at BioMar, and the search for novel ingredients to advance innovation and sustainability is ongoing. The research and development on algae-based ingredients in BioMar dates back in 2013 with extensive internal and external research projects. A recent example was the Alga4Fuel&Aqua project, a collaboration between BioMar Hellenic, the University of Thessaly and other key stakeholders. The first commercial feeds containing microalgae hit the markets in 2016, and by 2021 BioMar had reached one million tonnes of salmon feeds containing microalgae. Now with the upscaling of microalgae in the raw material portfolio at the Brande facility in BioMar, it is now no longer considered a niche ingredient.

Anders Brandt-Clausen, Managing Director, BioMar Baltics, explains, “microalgae has been a game-changing strategic ingredient for us for years, and still is. We are now delighted to increase the volumes we use significantly and raise the sustainability bar for our flagship products. Microalgae is no longer a novel idea, it has become a commercial reality.”



Including microalgae high in long chain omega fatty acids in feed allows manufacturers to reduce levels of wild fish © Veramaris

Sustainable and nutritious profile Marine ingredients such as fishmeal and fish oil are excellent sources of nutrients vital for fish nutrition, however they are finite resources. By including microalgae high in long chain omega fatty acids in feed diets, it is now possible to bypass the wild fish and go straight to the original source of marine omega-3s. This helps to relieve pressure on our oceans while ensuring that the fish are getting the optimal nutrition required, and it also lowers the fish-in-fish-out ratio. Algae as a key factor in achieving climate targets BioMar has made significant efforts to source raw materials and ingredients that do not compete with the human supply chain. As part of these efforts, the company pledged to create aquafeeds that were 50 percent circular and restorative by 2030.

Adding microalgae paves the way for the upcoming developments on our sustainable feeds that our farmers will directly benefit with a reduction in their own on-farm footprint. Anders Brandt-Clausen, BioMar Baltics

Circular raw materials are those originating from by-product and waste streams and BioMar define restorative ingredients as raw materials that significantly shift the balance between ecosystem impacts and human production systems towards a net-positive environmental outcomes. “We see this as the birth stage for the next generation feeds with a highly sustainable profile from Brande. Adding microalgae paves the way for the upcoming developments on our sustainable feeds that our farmers will directly benefit with a reduction in their own on-farm footprint,” he concludes.",,[],[]

Microalgae are also known as microphytes. They are microscopic algae that are found in marine systems and freshwater. According to their species, they can vary in size and shape, ranging from micrometers to hundred micrometers. The main function of microalgae is that it converts the sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into algal biomass. Gaining popularity as a promising nutrient source, microalgae impart high nutrition and comprise high-value compounds including pigments, fatty acids, and anti-oxidants.

The Impact of COVID-19 on the Microalgae Market

The COVID-19 pandemic has strained consumer F&B product manufacturers due to reduced consumption and disrupted supply chains. The F&B sector has witnessed a minor decline due to the lockdowns imposed across various countries. This scenario has also negatively impacted the confectionery industry since people are buying only essential products. In addition, government bodies have passed various rules and regulations on the purchase of essential goods. According to trade organizations in the nutritional products industry, there has been a significant impact on the global supply chain for functional foods and dietary supplements, which has, in turn, lowered the consumption of microalgal biomass among end-users impacting the growth of this market.

In the algae industry, a major slowdown in microalgae sales was witnessed in the first quarter of 2020 due to disruptions in logistics and transportation. The market also witnessed interruptions in the entire value chain from raw materials supply for culture media to production, packaging, and biomass distribution.

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this market were felt in China starting 2020, as the country is one of the world's largest producers and one of the leading consumers of microalgal species. In China, factory closures, microalgae processing facilities operating at reduced capacities, and restrictions on importing and exporting algae biomass strongly impacted the microalgae market. Moreover, the pandemic is also expected to adversely impact the microalgae market in many countries globally, including the U.S., India, Australia, Brazil, and the EU-5 countries. Due to the countrywide lockdown in India, many commercial microalgae production and processing facilities have shut down or are operating at reduced capacities, leading to substantial losses in domestic microalgal production.

However, good nutrition intake is the top priority to maintain an optimal immune system, supporting the strong demand for plant and algae protein food products & beverages through e-commerce platforms. In addition, some of the algal protein products are considered to support the human immune system. According to various researches, spirulina inhibits influenza virus replication and reduces virus-induced mortality. For instance, according to the findings by immunologists at the University of California Davis School of Medicine, the addition of spirulina to cultured immune system cells significantly increased the production of infection-fighting cytokines. Besides, researchers at UC at Davis studying the effects of spirulina on both anemia and immune function found that spirulina, with its rich content of flavonoids and sulfalipids, modulates the production of cytokines and with its bioactive proteins stimulates the intestinal immune system to enhance the responsiveness to vaccines and improve allergic rhinitis.

Similarly, the chlorella market is experiencing a positive impact mainly due to the key role of chlorella in the immune health system. Chlorella is used as a healthy, natural, and sustainable superfood. During the pandemic, consumers demanded food ingredients that strengthened the immune and digestive systems. For this reason, microalgae/algae have been one of the superfood trends in Europe.

Thus, the demand for microalgal species, such as spirulina and chlorella, increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as the focus on the nutritional content increased. Despite the increase in demand, there were hindrances in the supply chain due to the lockdown imposed by governments in many countries.

Key Findings in the Microalgae Market Study

The microalgae market is segmented on the basis of distribution channel (consumer channel, business channel), type (Spirulina, Chlorella, Dunaliella Salina, Haematococcus Pluvialis, and other microalgae), and application (nutraceuticals, food & beverages, animal feed, cosmetics, and others). The study also evaluates industry competitors and analyzes the market at a regional and country level.

New species of green microalga identified in São Paulo,"The discovery resulted in phylogenetic reclassification of microalgae in the genus Nephrocytium. An article on the research is in Taxon.

A group led by researchers affiliated with the Phycology Laboratory at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, have discovered a new species of green microalga in a reservoir located in the northwest of the state. As a result of the discovery, microalgae of the genus Nephrocytium have been moved to an order belonging to a different taxonomic class and phylogenetically reclassified (placed in a new family).

Green microalgae are found in freshwater and in the sea (where they are known as phytoplankton) and produce more than 80% of the oxygen present in the atmosphere. They are considered primary producers and hence the base of the food chain in aquatic environments. In addition, they have significant potential for commercial applications, such as biodiesel production.

The new species was found in a fishing pond called Muritiba, fed by a spring near the town of Tupã. The species was isolated in 2014 and is now part of UFSCar’s Freshwater Microalgae Culture Collection (CCMA). Begun in 1977 by Armando Augusto Henriques Vieira early in his career as a professor in the Department of Botany, CCMA is one of the world’s largest and oldest collections of freshwater microalgae, with some 800 strains deposited and conserved for researchers to analyze and potentially commercialize.

The new species was named Nephrocytium vieirae as a tribute to Vieira, who has retired and is now a senior professor at the university. The research that identified it was part of several projects supported by FAPESP (11/50054-4, 12/19520-1, 13/17457-3, 13/18083-0 and 16/07089-5).

The study involved samples collected at more than 300 sites including reservoirs, marches, bogs and lakes in all 22 hydrographic regions of the state. After collection by various scientists under Vieira’s supervision, the material was isolated in the laboratory and identified on the basis of morphology. During this process, a particular alga was isolated and identified as a morphotype similar to Nephrocytium. In taxonomy, a morphotype is an individual or set of organisms distinguished within the same species by having a certain physical structure.

Inessa Lacativa Bagatini, now a professor in UFSCar’s Department of Botany, was then a postdoctoral fellow under Vieira. After cleansing the specimen of contaminants such as fungi and bacteria, Bagatini found a molecular marker by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing. The marker placed the strain in the genus Nephrocytium, but pointed to the possibility that a new species had been found.

Thaís Garcia da Silva, first author of an article published on the research, was then studying different algal morphotypes for her doctorate. She sequenced other markers in the specimens and analyzed their morphology under an optical microscope. She then submitted them to transmission electron microscopy, cleaving cells to study the organelles, and scanning electron microscopy, analyzing the cell surface. This part of the research was assisted by Naiara Carolina Pereira Archanjo, also a researcher in UFSCar’s Department of Botany and a PhD candidate at the time.

Silva and Bagatini also collaborated with Lenka Štenclová, a researcher at the University of South Bohemia in the Czech Republic, to obtain molecular markers of a Nephrocytium species not available from CCMA at UFSCar. Integration of all this data confirmed that the DNA sequence obtained for the isolated strain was different from those of other species described in the literature. “Microalgae can have very similar morphology in various situations so that molecular markers must be used to decide whether a new species has been discovered, as was the case here,” Silva explained.

The next step was the mapping of a phylogenetic tree for Nephrocytium vieirae. Phylogeny traces the evolutionary history of a species, organizing beings into hierarchical taxonomic categories such as kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species. A phylogenetic tree depicts the lines of evolutionary descent from a common ancestor, rather as a genealogical tree does for human families.

“When we were constructing the phylogenetic tree, we confirmed the suggestion in recent research that the genus belonged to a different class,” Silva said. In this stage of the study, the microalga in question was compared with microalgae in all families belonging to the order Sphaeropleales, to which it is allocated, and the researchers conducted a review of the scientific literature in which occurrences of the genus Nephrocytium were mentioned.

Phylogenetic reclassification

In the course of reclassifying the new species, the researchers noted several traits that would not let them keep microalgae of the genus Nephrocytium in the class Trebouxiophyceae, order Chlorellales and family Oocystaceae, as per the scientific literature. Based on the data they obtained in their various analyses, they proposed the creation of a new family, Nephrocytiaceae, belonging to the class Chlorophyceae and order Sphaeropleales.

The article with their findings is published in Taxon, the journal of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT), and signed by Silva, Bagatini, Štenclová and Archanjo.

As detailed in the article, microalgae of the family Nephrocytiaceae, including the newly discovered species N. vieirae, can be distinguished from others in the order Sphaeropleales by a combination of morphological traits, smooth cell surfaces, asexual reproduction via autospores, differences in ultrastructure (cell architecture visible at higher magnifications than found on a standard optical microscope), and molecular data. These characteristics corroborated their phylogenetic reclassification and placement in a new family.

Other reports of the new species

Publication of the results enables other researchers in Brazil and elsewhere to use the molecular markers to find out whether specimens can be classified as N. vieirae. “The morphology of N. lunatum closely resembles that of the recent discovery in Tupã. Anyone who has collected a Nephrocytium and not done a molecular phylogenetic analysis is likely to think it’s N. lunatum. Publication of our findings showing that we now have this marker could enable others to identify microalgae of the new species in other countries where massive parallel sequencing is used,” Bagatini said.

Massive parallel sequencing is widely deployed in research on microalgae. It entails simultaneous sequencing of many samples without observing morphology and comparing the results with sequences stored in a database. “If no matches with other organisms are found, the specimen is placed in the closest genus or taxonomic group,” Bagatini explained. The alternative is morphological and molecular analysis of individual organisms.

Correct classification is essential not only for researchers to be able to continue their studies but also for the development of industrial and biotech applications in general. “If you’re studying a species to develop a cancer drug, for example, and you want to look at others that maybe could produce more of the compound in question, you’ll look for a species that’s phylogenetically close,” Bagatini said, adding that incorrect taxonomic classification can lead to selection of organisms that lack the desired characteristics.

UFSCar’s microalgae collection

The new microalga joins a collection formed from a project that started with the sea. In 1970, Vieira was an undergraduate studying biology at the University of São Paulo (USP) and embarking on an internship at the Oceanographic Institute (IO-USP), where he would organize a marine phytoplankton collection. There he learned how to isolate marine microalgae and managed to mount a collection of some 100 strains. He worked at IO-USP until 1977, when he moved to UFSCar to focus on freshwater microalgae, whose study he decided to prioritize after attending a lecture on these organisms while still an undergraduate. UFSCar’s collection began with specimens collected in the vicinity of the university, but microalgae were soon being collected in other areas of the state thanks to funding won by Vieira.

“We improved the quality of the collection as time passed, and some four years ago we implemented a cryogenic system to conserve microalgae in liquid nitrogen,” he said.

UFSCar’s collection has been used for research on biodiesel and to test swimming pool water treatment systems, as well as in research projects at several institutions around Brazil conducted by master’s and PhD candidates, and even by high school students. “Demand was low for a long time but has risen in the last few years because of an increase in potential uses,” Vieira said.

After retiring, he handed over to Bagatini as curator of the collection. “I’ve continued to help, and I plan to return and resume my support when the pandemic permits. There’s still plenty of material in the collection that needs to be studied,” he said.

Asked how he felt about having a species named after him, he said, “I’m flattered and grateful.” Because of this homage, his name does not appear as an author of the article, even though he supervised the team. “I was lucky to have such good students. They’re now fully qualified professionals working in Brazil and abroad,” he noted.

Produced Water Treatment Using Microalgae,"A team of researchers, writing in the journal Sustainability have developed a method that uses microalgae for the bioremediation of PW that could also open up the opportunity for the production of biofuels for added-value products as a sustainable approach.

Study: Biological-Based Produced Water Treatment Using Microalgae: Challenges and Efficiency. Image Credit: Perception7/Shutterstock.com

Produced water (PW) is a term the oil and gas industries use to describe water that is generated as a byproduct of extracting oil and natural gas. PW is a kind of brackish and saline water from the underground formation that surface and contain significant amounts of industrial wastewater (WW).

With around 250 million barrels of naturally occurring PW produced each day, this waste by-product raises serious concerns as it poses an environmental effect as around 40% of PW generated makes its way into the environment.

With the ongoing expansion of the oil and gas industries, it is anticipated that the volume of PW will increase, and therefore it is vital to come up with efficient and sustainable ways to treat this industrial wastewater and limit its environmental impact.

Bioremediation

Bioremediation is the use of microbial species to clean up contaminated media such as water, soil, and subsurface material that has been polluted by discharged chemicals and impurities. Typically, the removal of organic matters is performed employing biological processes via bacterial cultures using conventional activated sludge processes.

However, due to the high concentration of organic matter, potential toxicity, and inhibition can hold back the large-scale application of these biological processes. Furthermore, there are other physiochemical methods available for the treatment of PW but these methods such as thermal and electrochemical methods are expensive and energy-intensive.

In contrast, using algae-based treatments could pave the way towards a cost-effective and efficient technique to treat a variety of wastewaters including PW.

Microalgae can be used to treat PW and remediate organic pollutants with the use of specific algal species. Moreover, microalgae treatment processes produce usable biomass for biofuel production and have an additional benefit of CO 2 capturing Professor Fares Almomani at the Department of Chemical Engineering, Qatar University

Almomani and his team also state that algal cultures could produce biofuels and other useful chemicals as well as solve economic and environmental problems. The bioremediation of PW using algae could be used to maintain freshwater resources in regions suffering water scarcity.

However, as it stands there are issues surrounding the method as it is limited in its current scope and further work is needed to explore the efficiency of algae in treating PW, generate valuable biomass, and identify the common algae species that can be used for PW treatment under different conditions.

The Algal Approach

Produced water (PW) characteristics may vary from region to region and therefore environmental impact may also differ depending on the properties of PW. The researchers observed that PW from gas wells was of greater toxicity than that of oil wells, however, the oil industry produces greater volumes of PW. The team state that specific treatments and approaches should be taken for PW in oil wells.

“Establishing a sustainable green technology such as algae for PW treatment, recovery, and reuse contributes to the production of biomass, which can be converted into biofuel,” says Almomani. This conversion could also assist in the removal efficiency of organic matters and dissolved solids, algae can also extract a number of constituents and pollutants from water and wastewater such as nutrients, heavy metals, and dissolved and complex organic chemicals via biosorption and bioaccumulation.

While chemical and other biological processes are available Almomani et al. identified microalgae as a promising technology for the treatment of wastewater and PW as microalgae can update various constituents of PW and use them as a growth medium.

Further Reading: Water Purification with Ceramic Beads

The researchers advise that further processing such as thermochemical, biochemical, or direct chemical means could demonstrate the potential of converting algal biomass to biofuels. “The algal approach incorporates resource recovery into the treatment model, which is a sustainable approach for PW remediation. This treatment process produces biomass that serves as raw materials for biofuel, bioactive compounds, and nutrient supplement production,” Almomani states.

Therefore, the effective treatment of PW could help alleviate and mitigate a range of issues such as water scarcity, environmental pollution, and enhance the recovery of sustainable resources from oil and gas fields. After additional processing, algae technology can remedy the toxic effects of contaminants present in PW and utilize beneficial compounds present and make water available for other uses.

Almomani and his team are buoyed by their findings and advocate for additional research in this promising field which not only offers PW for reuse but also offers a fantastic opportunity to use the algal approach for biofuel production via the three common routes and other added-value products.

The canal system includes six freshwater canals located south of Sattlewood Farms, west of Trafalgar Middle School, and east of Sandoval; where you will see warning signs warning of the risks. Those warnings include not eating shellfish from the Borris Canal System or swimming in the canal or touching your face or eyes if you come into contact with the water in the canal.

After discovering blue-green algae last week, the City of Cape Coral is starting to take steps to remove those algae from the system. Thursday’s actions are deploying 100 of these charcoal screens that will remove nutrients from the system.

The screens stretch across the canal's algae-contaminated area near Veterans Memorial Parkway and SW 20th Avenue.

Cape Coral’s Environmental Biologist Kraig Hankins says the idea is once the algae are killed, there will be an increase in water nutrients. That is not a good thing, Hankins says if they are not removed, they could feed a future Caloosahatchee River bloom.

Charcoal screens, Hankins says, work as a home tap water drinking filter.

“It acts to remove about 95% of the phosphorus, 90% of the nitrogen, it will remove heavy metals if those are in the system,” said Hankins. “It basically locks that kind of stuff and acts like a sponge. So it will hang on to it. So, we will leave these in place for maybe 2 months. And once the algae are treated, the nutrients will be released and come downstream. And we are trying to catch it before it goes across Veterans, and that’s saltwater.""

Hankins says this will be a two-month process. Once this is done each screen will be nutrient-filled, so they can be sold back to the vendor to then be resold to help with agricultural planting. They plan to re-sell the 9-dollar screen for 4 dollars.

As for the algicide, a peroxide-based solution will be used, which acts as an oxidizer. Think steel or iron turning to rust. The hope is it kills the algae.

We asked FGCU Water School professor Dr. Mike Parsons if he agreed with what cape biologists are doing.

“Yeah, because you are dealing directly with the problem which is the bloom with the hydrogen-peroxide,” said Dr. Parsons. “And you are dealing with one of the causes of the problem which is the nutrients that lead to the bloom in the first place.”

Dr. Parsons, also a member of the state's Blue-Green Algae Taskforce, says he does not expect the solution to hurt or kill fish, because it's only made of water and oxygen. but he says you still need to be careful.

“It’s like if you are going to overthrow a government and then you have a power vacuum,” said Dr. Parsons. “Who is going to step in? So, you are removing all the coccoid bacteria or the majority of it. You are removing other microalgae, single-cell algae, and bacteria. So, who is left to fill that void and how are they then going to change conditions? Will it be for the better? Will you get a different species blooming?”

Dr. Parsons believes the charcoal screens, which remove water nutrients that can cause future algae blooms, show him Cape Coral city biologists are already thinking about potential future problems.",,[],['Andrew Shipley']
"Yemoja developing red microalgae for ‘bloody’ plant-based burgers, steaks","Yemoja, Ltd. (Tel Hai, Israel) is developing a red microalgae that gives plant-based burgers and steaks an authentic “bloody” juiciness. The ingredient will be branded Ounje, which means “food” in the Yoruba language. The red algae are grown indoors in high-precision photobioreactors in a way that sharply reduces waste and resources and has a minimal ecologic footprint.

“While working on a new formulation for cosmetic applications, we serendipitously discovered that this specific composition yields a substance that resembles blood in appearance and texture,” said Amikam Bar-Gil, PhD, co-founder and CTO of Yemoja, in a press release. “Encouraged by the first test results, we decided to push the boundaries further and take it to the next level, trying it out in test products. The results were an immediate proof of concept.”

The patented microalgal heme substitute not only provides the initial red pigment to raw plant-based meats, but it also browns nicely and congeals like real meat juices. “We found the polysaccharides within this particular algae species express a viscosity similar to gelatin when cooked. Its natural fiber also awards an appealing crunchiness and emits an appetizing meaty aroma,” Bar-Gil said. Plus, it adds a nutrient boost, including protein, essential fatty acids, polyphenols, minerals, and vitamins.

Yemoja produces its algae-heme substitute via a cold process in its GMP-certified facility without using any organic solvents. “We believe our algae can imbue cultured meat-cells with a nutrient-rich media to feed on,” Bar-Gil said. “We are currently assessing its potential to act as a suitable biomaterial scaffold on which the cells can grow. This structure will allow it to mimic the behavior of meat, especially when it hits the skillet.”",,[],['Alissa Marrapodi']
New Microalgae May Help Coral Reefs from Coral Bleaching — MARIST CIRCLE,"Hearts pound fast, muscles tighten, breath quickens and blood pressure rises in response to stress the bodies of humans undergo. People experience these bodily changes in reaction to stressful environments; organisms experience something similar.

Organisms like coral reefs experience coral bleaching when environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrients change causing the coral reefs to turn fully white.

The whitening of these coral reefs is dangerous. The white color is caused when the ocean conditions are altered and in response to this, the symbiotic algae, mutually benefiting organisms, that live in the tissues of these reefs, that serve as their food, is released to cope with the warming of the oceans that makes them starve. As this algae is released, the vibrant color of the coral becomes flushed and becomes colorless. This morbid activity that happens to these reefs is not only harmful to themselves but to the ecosystem itself.

“The unfolding crisis in coral reefs will have profound environmental, economic, social, and cultural consequences for reef-dependent societies,” Tiffany H. Morrison, Professor of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies institute at James Cook University, and her team of researchers said in their paper published in One Earth.

“Reefs provide critical ecosystem services, such as fisheries, tourism, and shoreline protection, that are essential to the social and cultural fabric of maritime tropical communities,” Morrison and her team said in their paper.

To help prevent these coral bleaching events, Dr. Patrick Buerger, molecular and microbial ecologist at the University of Melbourne, and his team of researchers have developed a microalgae strain that provides heat protection for the coral reefs. “We evolved 10 clonal strains of a common coral microalgal endosymbiont at elevated temperatures,” said Buerger and his team of researchers in their paper published in Science Advances.

Buerger and his research team developed this microalgae strain, a marine vertebra more bearing to temperature change by adapting it to warming temperatures over a span of four years.

“Once the microalgae were reintroduced into coral larvae, the newly established coral-algal symbiosis was more heat-tolerant compared to the original one,” explained Buerger and his team.

The authors’ paper emphasized how globally corals are “suffering mass mortalities from marine heat waves” from the rising environmental stresses. Plants and organisms can adapt to a changing environment and overall climate, but when it changes at a rate that is faster than they can handle, issues arise.

Climate oscillations are a natural phenomenon where various weather patterns have short continuous changes; wind direction, air pressure and sea temperature are just a few of these.

Instances like the 2005 Caribbean coral bleaching event resulted in a loss of half of the coral, and the 2010 bleaching in the Florida reefs had fatal repercussions.

The rapid speed of climate change seems daunting and unpredictable; however, short-term, and long-term solutions are being sought out. Buerger and his team demonstrated that “coral stock with enhanced climate resilience can be developed through ex hospite laboratory evolution of their microalgal endosymbionts.”

Successfully, the researchers were able to exhibit how the microalgae and coral can communicate and build on the reef's resistance to heat.

“Further research is required to examine whether the enhanced heat tolerance of the laboratory-evolved strains is maintained in the field under long-term exposure to ambient temperature (i.e., outside the summer season),” said the authors.",,[],"['Maddi Langweil', 'Emma Denes', 'Catherine Ramos', 'Guest Contributor']"
ProVeg incubator targets mushroom and microalgae-based alternative-proteins,"Seven start-ups have joined the incubator to develop the next generation of sustainable foods, “without animals and without comprising on taste, texture, or functionality​”, explains Albrecht Wolfmeyer, Head of the ProVeg Incubator.

The global team have expertise in the three major approaches to alt-protein production: plant-based, fermentation, and cultivation.

This includes Colombian start-up, Fotortec, that has developed a scalable, circular system to produce mushroom-based ingredients using oyster mushrooms that grow on vegetable waste. Fotortec can upcycle vegetable waste (that would normally be discarded) using a technological process that mimics the way vegetable biomass is recycled in nature and addresses the universal problem of food waste.

Meanwhile German innovator, EatMyPlants, is developing microalgae using a fermentation process. One of the benefits of microalgae cultivation is that it does not compete with land and resources required for traditional crops and has a superior yield compared to traditional crops. It is high protein and exhibits “a huge potential to meet the dietary requirements of growing population”​, according to research supplied by ProVeg.

“The ProVeg Incubator is bringing together a powerhouse of young start-up founders,”​ Wolfmeyer comments.

“Our latest cohort leverages cutting-edge ingredients like microalgae and fungi and creates novel ingredients like heme and dairy proteins for the alt-protein industry​.”

Accelerating innovation​

ProVeg’s incubator programme harnesses innovation from global start-ups to accelerate the development of “disruptive alternatives​” to animal-based products. The eighth round began on April 4 and will run online for 12 weeks.

Since it launched in 2018, the programme has collaborated with more than 60 start-ups globally and has collectively raised more than £192m (€230m).

Participants have access to a broad network of industry contacts, exclusive events, and co-working spaces. Each company is assigned an expert mentor, with one-on-one coaching once a week, and can benefit from marketing and media support and funding of up to £209,000 (€250,000).

The current incubator group also includes companies from the US, Canada, India, Germany, and Israel, are: OceanTastes, Biofect Innovations, Rewild Solutions, Culminate Foods, and Fabumin and are developing cultured seafood, meat-like products, cultured fat, and a plant-based alternative to the protein found in egg whites, respectively.

Global change​

ProVeg International is a non-profit organisation established to transform the global food system by replacing animal-based products with plant-based and cultured alternatives. The organisation’s mission is to reduce global animal consumption by 50% to 2040.

It is made up of multiple national organisations, each of them generating revenue in a variety of ways, such as through private donations, trusts and foundations, the V-Label and membership fees.

The organisation brings together decision-makers, businesses, investors, the media, and the general public to initiate change and help society and economies transition to a more sustainable system of food production.

The 12-week accelerator programmes are led by experts and include workshops and coaching sessions, a test kitchen, industry meet and greets, and various events to provide start-ups with the skills, knowledge, funding, and support they need to succeed. Each incubator culminates in an investment-focused Start-up Demo Day.",,[],[]
Israeli Firm Reveals Innovative Process To Commercialize Lab-Grown Seafood,"The COVID-19 pandemic has given the alternative food industry a significant boost as consumers have become more interested in meat and seafood solutions that are sustainable and safer to eat. But even as lab-grown meat and other products have obtained significant backing from investors in the past few years, creating a cultured product requires ingredients, technologies, and processes that are just not cost effective.

This is the reason why it has been difficult for cultured food companies to commercialize these products and why you don’t see more of them in stores.

Mermade Seafoods, a Jerusalem-based startup that is growing scallops in a lab as its first product, tells NoCamels the company has unveiled a way to cut the hefty price tag of lab-grown food and an innovative process to produce it for the masses.

“We specifically target cultured seafood. We eventually want to replace the entire seafood industry, hopefully, the traditional one,” Mermade’s CEO Daniel Einhorn explains.

Food grown in a lab is created through a large collection of cells that are cultivated through fermentation in a bioreactor, or any manufactured device or system that supports a biologically active environment. Like any other normal, living organism, one needs to feed these cells and they produce waste. According to Einhorn, most companies give these cells fresh food and then discard the waste. Then they do the process over and over again. This becomes a very unsustainable process because it’s very expensive and because one needs to handle large volumes of waste.

Mermade Seafoods does not discard that waste. Instead, the company has developed a unique recycling process that allows them to reuse the waste over and over again. The biological recycling system is made from microalgae.

Mermade Seafoods co-founders (l to r): Dr. Tomer Halevy, COO, Daniel Einhorn, CEO, and Dr. Rotem Kadir, CTO

“We take that waste, which is rich in ammonia and carbon dioxide and we give it to the algae. The algae thrive on those materials — that is their food — so they grow and now you have a lot of algae. So if you choose the strains of algae right and you also do other sorts of biological magic – basically [natural] selection, then you can choose algae that produce the ingredients that you need. Ingredients that you can take from the algae and give back as feed for the cells,” Einhorn says. In short, “we grow microalgae on the waste produced by any animal cell culture and then upcycle that algae into useful growth medium ingredients.”

Founded just under a year ago, Mermade Seafood is in the pre-seed stage and has raised $1.5 million for its transformative technology, which aims to use to address the biggest challenges of the cell-based industry including high production costs and waste accumulation.

Einhorn tells NoCamels that as far as he knows Mermade is the only company using the fairly well-known aquacultural practice — aquaponics — in cellular agriculture, the production of animal-based products from cell cultures. Aquaponics is the combination of aquaculture (growing fish and aquatic animals) and hydroponics (growing plants without soil) where plants are fed the waste of the aquatic animals. They are bringing this novel approach to the production of cell-based seafood.

Mermade has even coined a term for this use of aquaponics in cellular agriculture. “We call it cytoponics,” Einhorn says.

The company has chosen to focus on lab-grown scallops as its first product because while most of the cultured seafood companies concentrate on some type of fish — mainly salmon, tuna, and some white fish– “we just think that it’s smarter to start with something simple and then iterate from there,” he says, noting that the process to create scallops in the lab is less challenging than the food engineering that goes into cultured meat and poultry and plant-based fish. According to Einhorn, they are currently the only company to create cell-based scallops.

“We take stem cells from scallops and we multiply them until we have enough to create food out of it. And then you need to do it many, many times over to a significant mass,” he says.

While scallops are easiest to produce as a cultured product, once the company improves its current process, the goal is to create other cultured seafood products, like shellfish.

“The technology that I described can be used with any fermentation process. So essentially, once we get it under control, you can even reduce the costs of medication that uses this kind of fermentation process to produce different proteins. So it would be relevant to a lot of industries. It’s just that it’s the shortest path to do it with scallops, but it could be used with any other animal meat or any cell fermentation process,” says Einhorn.

According to Einhorn, Mermade wants to use this recycling process to help commercialize the entire spectrum of the cultured food industry and make them less costly on the shelves.

“It’s unclear that currently there is no other alternative to really reducing the cost of cultured meat and cultured meat is essentially an industry stuck on that point. I’m not saying that we’re the only ones who would eventually solve this…I’m just saying that…there’s really no other available alternative right now to lower costs enough for cultured meat to justify its commercialization. And that’s actually the real reason why you don’t see cell-based meats on shelves right now. There are other issues, but that’s the main one,” he says.

“That would be the shortest answer for why cultured meat is not on the shelves right now.”",,[],['Simona Shemer']
Hydrogen from Nanoporous Microalgae as a Source of Clean and Renewable Energy,"The potential scope and methodologies for producing hydrogen from living diatoms and their waste in specifically built photobioreactors are discussed in a recent study published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. Storing numerous energy sources from microalgae is not only easy but also reduces the expense of growing the algae.

Study: Hydrogen economy and storage by nanoporous microalgae diatom: Special emphasis on designing photobioreactors. Image Credit: petrmalinak/Shutterstock.com

Diatoms are tiny glass menageries found among many microalgae that are capable of turning accumulated fats and cellulose into hydrogen as well as absorbing 25% of atmospheric CO 2 . Furthermore, their silicon frustules are naturally occurring bionanomaterials with a wide range of uses in biotechnology, including hydrogen generation and fuel cells.

To create or store hydrogen in different fuel cells, diatom frustules are fused with diverse physical and biochemical elements.

Hydrogen (H 2 ): An Important Green Energy Source

Researchers are trying to figure out how to produce energy in a more environmentally friendly manner as a result of global warming.

Hydrogen (H 2 ) gas is regarded as the ideal fuel for a world where air pollution is on the rise. H 2 and bioelectricity have created enticing mobility and power generating options with the least amount of fossil fuel emissions.

Because H 2 is a carbon-free fuel, employing it as a source of energy will help to reduce environmental pollutants such as greenhouse gas emissions and ocean acidification.

This is significant because, as humanity progresses toward a future of electric cars, we will need a large amount of electrical storage so that power for EVs is not only reliant on sunlight, wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear power.

As the combustion engine age is coming to a close, energy from microalgae, particularly diatoms, can be used to power hybrid EVs. Furthermore, with the arrival of H 2 battery storage, the possibility of EVs being powered by fuel cell technology has increased owing to an increased need for energy production.

Microbial fuel cells (MFC) combined with microalgal photobioreactors (PBRs) are one way to create these novel H 2 fuel cells.

Why Diatoms are Important for Hydrogen Storage?

Many obstacles remain in the practical use of algae biofuel for use in automobiles and other internal combustion engines. This is mostly owing to its high manufacturing costs.

However, diatoms alone are essential for 30% of worldwide crude oil production among microalgae. They are thought to fix roughly 25% of CO 2 Concentration via photosynthesis, resulting in carbon-rich final products.

Harvesting microalgae final products are a cost-effective approach since it includes sucking fats without harming the algae.

Because the cell walls of diatoms are comprised of silicon, they are hard to break. H 2 is one of the most significant value-added goods that is produced and typically goes to waste owing to storage issues.

Thus, storing the H 2 generated either during photocatalysis of microalgae or during microbial digestion of algal biomass is a pressing necessity.

Hydrogen Economy and Storage in Diatom

To bioenergy and other value-added chemicals from diatoms, they are in a better situation than other microalgae for the production of H 2 . Moreover, when combined with devices with limited photocatalytic performance, they create H 2 more effectively. As a result, they are less costly than other microalgae.

However, owing to costly pre-treatment methods such as gathering, dehydration, tar formation, and low carbon conversion ratio, microalgae-based H 2 has yet to be industrialized.

Researchers have discovered a solution to avoid harvesting and dehydration in microalgae treatment for final products by using tar-free catalytic reactive flash volatilization (RSV), which transforms biomass rich in lignocellulosic materials and glucose into synthesis gas in the vicinity of Ni and other metallic composite accelerators.

Conclusion and Prospects

In terms of H 2 bio-economy, several criteria must be met, the most important of which is improving ways for natural H 2 synthesis using photosensitive microbial fuel cells.

Anaerobic digestion and photodegradation of water by algae during photosynthesis are used in these fuel cells, which not only clean sewage and remove contaminants, but also produce H 2 , energy, and biodiesel.

This not only reduces the total cost of the operation but also offers up new options for assisting the seamless transition to the electric vehicle (EV) period. Although H 2 generation from microalgae has several limitations, fuel cells based on microalgae such as diatom have many potential techniques to boost H 2 output.

Overall, Bio-H 2 is a reliable fuel since it is eco-friendly, cutting pollution, global warming, and rising temperatures.

Duplaco Launches Golden-Coloured Chlorella to Discreetly Fortify Plant-Based Foods,"Dutch manufacturer Duplaco has developed a new variety of golden-coloured chlorella, making it possible to add nutrients to plant-based foods without the green colour associated with the regular variety.

Duplaco Gold is 40% protein (including all the essential amino acids), and rich in vitamins and minerals. This includes some that can be more challenging to obtain on a plant-based diet, such as iron and B12.

The product is already being used by Dutch alt-seafood startup Monkeys by the Sea in the coating of its plant-based fish nuggets. According to Duplaco, it would also be ideal for use in baked goods, pasta, and meat alternatives.

White chlorella

Duplaco Gold only has a slight colour, but the company is also working on an entirely colourless white chlorella that would be especially suitable for use in alt-dairy products.

“Our cultivation method avoids chemical treatment, which is used by other manufacturers to extract the chlorophyll from the Chlorella algae afterwards,” said Marcel Oogink, founder of Duplaco. “Duplaco Gold now allows producers to address the trend towards healthy foods without changing their taste, aroma or appearance.”

The market for algae protein

Globally, the algae protein market is expected to be worth $1.1 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 6.6%. This growth will be driven mainly by increased health awareness, along with environmental concerns.

Seaweed (a type of algae) is also seeing strong growth, with investment in the industry rising by 36% to reach $168 million in 2021. Seaweed is a highly sustainable crop as it requires no land, freshwater, or fertiliser.

“Seaweed is an important part of the earth’s ecosystem, and it has the potential to be a powerful tool to absorb carbon emissions and slow warming,” said Frances Wang, program manager of carbon dioxide removal for ClimateWorks Foundation.",,[],[]
Protein made from microalgae fed with food waste comes to Europe,"Sophie’s BioNutrients is developing a range of microalgae-based protein flours for plant-based meat and alt dairy categories.

Aside from being high in protein, microalgae are a source of carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fatty acids, iron and B vitamins.

However, at this year’s Food Ingredients Europe (FiE) event in Frankfurt, Sophie’s BioNutrients CEO and co-founder Eugene Wang did not play up its health benefits. “We all know microalgae is nutritious,” ​he told delegates.

Rather, the start-up is setting itself apart in terms of sustainability and functionality: it embraces the circular economy and according to Wang, its first protein powder product is ‘good enough for any kind of plant-based dairy application’.

Protein with ‘wonderful colour and flavour’​

Sophie’s BioNutrients was established in 2017 by co-founders Wang and CTO Kirin Tsuei, after Wang learnt of his daughter Sophie’s allergy to shellfish. Their mission was to create a high-quality, nutritious, and importantly, non-allergenic, protein alternative.

Observing the meat-free trend, the founders noted it was being dominated by plant-based alternatives. Wang takes issue with many of these products, stressing some are allergenic, lacking in nutrients and variety, challenging to scale and expensive.

“The question is: Is the plant-based protein we’re promoting to the world really the silver bullet we’re looking for? We do not think so.”​

Sophie’s BioNutrients’ solution lies in microalgae, which it ferments in bioreactors before isolating its proteins and transforming it into a powder for food formulation.

To kickstart production, the team underwent a thorough strain selection process. “We’ve been through, by now, over 1,200 different species of microalgae,” ​said Wang. “We finally found about four strains that we can grow, in the dark, in fermentation…that are sturdy enough to be fed with all kinds of industrial waste.” ​

The CEO continued: “After our protein isolation process, it has a wonderful colour, a wonderful flavour…a protein flour that in the future can be priced competitively.”​

Circular economy​

An undoubtedly attractive quality of microalgae for Sophie’s BioNutrients is its sustainability profile compared to animal- or even some plant-based alternatives.

At FiE, Wang described the production process as ‘maximum protein with minimum footprint’.

“The beauty of [leveraging] fermentation, is that everything is a lot less,” ​he explained, comparing land-use, time, water, and energy-use with animal protein production, as well as pea and soy, on a per-unit basis. Indeed, its microalgae-based protein powder can be produced in just three days, and producing one ton uses just 0.02 hectares of space.

“But more importantly, with fermentation, you don’t have …harmful herbicides, fertilisers, antibiotics or hormones.” ​

The other strong sustainability angle is Sophie BioNutrients’ commitment to the circular economy. The start-up is feeding its microalgae strains with side streams from the food and beverage industry.

Three primary side streams are being upcycled for this purpose: brewer’s spent grains, okara (soybean pulp), and molasses from sugar refineries.

Partaking in the circular economy also yields financial benefits, the CEO explained. “It turns out it’s a wonderful idea, not only does it create a circular economy, but it also helps reduce our production costs.”​

Commercialisation strategy​

Sophie’s BioNutrients is targeting manufacturers of plant-based meat and dairy alternatives with a range of protein flours.

Founded in Singapore, the start-up is making plans to move ‘a lot’ of its operations to Europe, revealed the CEO: “My guys are planning to relocate from Singapore to Amsterdam at the moment.”​

Wang continued: “Quite frankly, we see the future of alternative protein, especially microalgae protein, right here in Europe.​

“So we want to make Europe our main customer base for the sale of our protein flour.”​

The start-up achieved its first Proof of Concept (POC) in a 10L bioreactor in 2018. Last year, it successfully upscaled to 10,000L.

It expects its first protein flour, which can be used for solubility, viscosity and foaming in milk, cheese and protein drink products, to reach the market in 2021-22. Its second protein flour has a similar timeline but has emulsification properties for meat alternatives.

Sophie BioNutrients plans to market at least another three protein flour products within the next three years.

Wang said he was convinced of the market opportunity within the protein alternatives space. “The market opportunity is very real,” ​he told delegates.

According to a 2021 study by BCG and Blue Horizon Corporation, the market for alternative meat, eggs, dairy, and seafood products is set to reach at least $290m by 2035.

However, even more relevant for Sophie’s BioNutrients, the same study predicts alternative proteins made from microorganisms like fungi, yeasts, and single-celled algae to reach taste, texture and price parity with conventional animal proteins by 2025.

“[The research] basically says that by the year 2035, people are going to consume a lot of tonnage of microorganism-based protein. And that translates into a huge among of dollars that in the future we can go after,” ​said Wang.",,[],['Flora Southey']
Researchers find micro algae variome for effective biofuel production,"[Courtesy of KAERI]

SEOUL -- Researchers from a state nuclear technology institute have developed a variome of microalgae that is more effective in producing biofuel than its brother species. The new type of green algae can also be used in the production of bioplastics.Through photosynthesis, green algae use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar. Unconsumed sugar is stored inside cells in the form of starch. When green algae are fermented, starch turns into bioethanol, a zero-carbon principle fuel used as a petrol substitute.The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) said in a statement on November 17 that its team of researchers found a variome of Chlamydomonas, a genus of green algae, by exposing the microorganisms to radioactive rays. The new beefed-up algae can store up to twice as much starch and can grow 20 percent more than its original species.KAERI said that because the new green algae were modified using a radiation breeding technique, it is free from environmental issues that are frequently caused by genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The radiation breeding technique exposes various tissue and organisms such as seeds and single-celled organisms to radiation in order to generate mutants with special traits. The method has been used for more than 80 years.""The newly-developed green algae can be used in the production of biofuel and bioplastic,"" KAERI researcher Ahn Joon-woo was quoted as saying. The researcher said that the microalgae will contribute to the establishment of a zero-carbon society.",,[],['Park Sae-Jin Reporter']

Czech Foodtech Mewery Becomes “The First European” Cultivated Pork Startup Using Microalgae,"The Czech startup Mewery holds the claim of being the first European foodtech startup developing cultivated pork on a proprietary microalgae base. The Brno-based foodtech has now received backing from US accelerator Big Idea Ventures to develop cultivated pork.

With pork meat being the second most consumed meat worldwide and the most consumed and preferred meat in Europe, Russia, and China, among others, Mewery has set its sights on becoming the European cultivated pork leader. Mewery is reported to be developing its unique technology based on microalgae in order to decrease the cost of cultivation by 70%. The company aims to be entering the market by 2026 pending regulatory approval.

Developing cultivated pork using microalgae growth factors instead of fetal bovine serum is a key factor in Mewery’s strategy, becoming the first Czech company to make it into the prestigious Big Idea Ventures portfolio. Following this initial undisclosed investment, another and larger investment round is now being prepared open to other investors.

“These methods have been used in pharma for many years”

There are other players currently in the European cultivated pork sector, including Higher Steaks, a leading food technology company in the UK that revealed the world’s first cultivated bacon and pork belly. In China, the country’s first cultivated meat company Joes Future Food recently raised $10.9 million to build a pork production line.

“One really needs to understand that the process of cultivating meat in the lab is just another process by which cells grow. It’s not Frankenstein-meat, it’s not something completely strange – these methods have been used in pharma for many years”, Mewery Founder and CEO Roman Laus told Radio Prague.

“The way we get meat now through industrial farming to our table is not sustainable – it cannot survive. So this is one of the options – not the only one, but one – for how to make our world more sustainable and to also get protein to an ever-growing population.”",,[],[]

Marlborough mussel farms put harvesting on hold following toxic algae bloom,"Routine tests on shellfish samples taken from the Pelorus Sound have shown Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxins above the safe limit.

A large toxic algae bloom has closed several commercial shellfish “growing areas” in the Marlborough Sounds.

And more are expected to close as the bloom increases in toxicity, according to New Zealand Food Safety.

Sanford general manager of mussels Mike Mandeno said on Friday five of their 19 mussel growing areas in the Marlborough Sounds were currently closed, and they had stopped harvesting from a further five areas as a precautionary measure. In many cases, a growing area contained multiple mussel farms.

Sanford could continue operating by harvesting in places unaffected by the bloom such as Golden Bay, Stewart Island and Banks Peninsula and as a result, were not seeing any significant impact on production or export, Mandeno said.

Supplied/Stuff A public health warning on May 4 advised against collecting shellfish from the entire Pelorus Sound.

“Algal blooms are something we are used to managing as mussel farmers and this one is no different.”

A public health warning was issued by the Ministry for Primary Industries on April 27, advising the public not to collect or consume shellfish harvested from Crail Bay. On May 4, this was extended to include the entire Pelorus Sound.

Routine tests on shellfish samples taken from the Pelorus Sound had shown levels of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxins above the safe limit of 0.8 mg/kg set by the ministry, which meant anyone who ate shellfish collected from the area were at risk of becoming ill.

A Cawthron Institute biotoxin status report issued on May 6 showed one area was particularly affected by the toxic bloom, with tests from Elie Bay showing PSP toxin levels of 7.8 mg/kg, nearly 10 times the safe limit.

Supplied/Marlborough Express Cawthron Institute manager of food and bioactives Dr Tim Harwood says PSP toxin levels can take anywhere from several weeks to several months to subside.

Marlborough Shellfish Quality Programme chairperson Bruce Hearn said the sites currently closed in the Pelorus Sound covered a “quite extensive” area.

The last time the entire Pelorus Sound was affected by a toxic algal bloom was in March 2019, which Hearn said closed some mussel harvesting areas “for months”.

Cawthron Institute manager of food and bioactives Dr Tim Harwood said the current approach was to wait until the harmful algal bloom had subsided and the shellfish were safe for human consumption again.

“In the case of PSP toxins, this can take anywhere from several weeks to several months,” he said.

“When microalgae are present and toxins exceed certain levels in shellfish, shellfish harvesting is not permitted. These measures ensure consumers of New Zealand shellfish remain safe.”

Supplied/Stuff An algae bloom at Nydia Bay in the Marlborough Sounds following a public health warning in March 2019.

Humans could be affected by PSP after eating filter-feeding shellfish which had consumed toxic microalgae that produced paralytic shellfish toxins, Harwood said.

“When toxic microalgae grow to high densities in seawater they are often referred to as a Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB). There are several kinds of toxic microalgae and these can produce an array of toxins that can accumulate in shellfish, causing different shellfish poisoning symptoms. PSP is one of these.”

He said there were a number of ecological factors which contributed to harmful algal blooms including water temperature, competition with other microalgal species, and nutrient availability.

“In the Marlborough Sounds, where these harmful algal blooms are now occurring fairly regularly, all of these factors are likely to play a part.”

The ministry advised anyone who had become ill after eating shellfish from an area where a public health warning had been issued to phone Healthline for advice on 0800 61 11 16, or seek medical attention immediately. People were also advised to contact their nearest public health unit and keep any leftover shellfish in case it could be tested.",,[],['Matthew Hampson']
New safety study makes case for use of microalgal species as functional feed ingredient,"The company is exploring the potential use of AQ biomass as a functional feed ingredient.

Alltech researchers says a study they had published in Regulatory Toxicity and Pharmacology​​​ demonstrates the safety of a heterotrophically-produced strain of AQ and supports its use as a non-toxic feed ingredient.

The findings ​

Comprising researchers based in France and Ireland, the Alltech team tested an industrially cultivated strain of AQ tested using Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines: acute skin irritation in rabbits; skin sensitization in guinea pigs; acute eye irritation in rabbits; acute oral fixed-dose procedure in rats; and bacterial reverse mutation using the BN Ames technique.

Results showed that AQ is non-irritant and non-sensitizing to skin. AQ caused transient conjunctival lacrimation and redness; however, the scores for these clinical signs translated into low ocular irritation indices and classification of AQ as non-irritant to the eyes, according to the authors.

An acute oral dose of AQ (2000 mg/kg) did not cause mortality, change in body weight gain, or any general, functional, and neurobehavioral clinical signs, they reported.

In five strains of Salmonella typhimurium bacteria, treatment with AQ did not cause biologically or statistically significant changes in the number of revertant colonies, indicating that AQ does not cause mutagenic toxicity, added the research team.

The results of the research shore up the application of AQ as a safe and non-toxic feed ingredient, they concluded.

Background ​

AQ, due to its high lipid content, has been investigated as a suitable alternative feedstock for biofuel production, with potential benefits in the area of green biotechnology (Oliveira et al., 2017; Sangapillai and Marimuthu, 2019), reported the Alltech team.

Studies on the physiological growth parameters and fatty acid profile of AQ have indicated optimal growth at 25°C across a wide pH range, with scalable mass-culture—an important feature for commercial applications (Ghosh et al., 2017; Hong et al., 2012), they remarked.

Hong et al. (2012) reported that certain strains of AQ could have the potential to be used as alternative omega-3 PUFA sources to fish oil. Alternatively, AQ growth can also be optimized for high carbohydrate and protein yields (Ghosh et al., 2017), noted the researchers.

There is also evidence that demonstrates the mycotoxin-binding capabilities of AQ when used as a feed ingredient, said the authors.

In a study over 21 days involving 508 Ross chicks, AQ was included in a diet at 0.5, 1, and 2 kg/ton that was contaminated with ochratoxin A (OTA) at a rate of 90 μg/kg. The inclusion of AQ resulted in a 13, 34, and 35% decrease in liver OTA concentration. This suggests a role for AQ as a mycotoxin binder for sequestering OTA in vivo (Moran et al., 2018), said the team.

“Furthermore, previous studies have shown algal glycans are as effective as other mycotoxin binders such as activated charcoal (Cavret et al., 2010). Therefore, elucidation of the AQ glycomic structure may establish its potential to bind other phytotoxins and mycotoxins of interest.”​

Toxicity risks ​

Establishing the safety of new microalgal species is essential to eliminate their potential toxicity to animals or humans, commented the authors.

“Toxicity can arise either through toxins intrinsic to the algae, or because of externally accumulated toxins such as heavy metals and pathogens (Becker, 2004; Van der Spiegel et al., 2013). In addition, there may be potential risks of severe side-effects and allergic reactions associated with some species of microalgae (Balasubramaniam et al., 2021). ​

“Certain Chlorella species of microalgae have been deemed safe based on extensive historical use (Enzing et al., 2014).”​

Safety and toxicity testing of newly isolated species therefore aids the traceability of the food chain and can instill user and consumer confidence, as well as hasten the placement of these microalgae in the market for sustainable food production applications, said the Alltech team.

“AQ has only recently emerged as a target for investigative research to explore its commercial potential, and is therefore, a largely novel species in these applications. Unsurprisingly, there are no published or publicly available safety studies on AQ to date. ​

“AQ is not included on the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) qualified presumption of safety (QPS) list in the European Union (EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ), 2021) nor is it considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in the US.” ​

Demonstrating the safety of AQ using these parameters will give confidence to its future use, investigative potential, and application as a safe and non-toxic specialty feed ingredient, said the researchers.",,[],['Jane Byrne']
Making Bioethanol with Both Fungi and Bacteria,"Bioethanol production has the potential to replace petrochemical-derived fuels for sectors such as the automotive industry. A new paper appearing in the journal Energies has explored the production of this alternative fuel from bacteria and fungi. Researchers from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Ariel University in Israel have contributed to the paper.

Bioethanol: A Green Alternative to Traditional Petrochemical Fuels

The harm that fossil fuel exploitation causes to the environment has been well documented in recent years. Along with the carbon emissions that are produced during manufacture and subsequent use, fossil fuel reserves are becoming depleted, facilitating the search for alternative fuels. Petrochemical production is struggling to keep up with demand as the world rapidly industrializes.

Bioethanol has been widely touted as a green, sustainable alternative to traditional petrochemical-derived fuels. This fuel can be produced from a multitude of natural, renewable resources such as crops and agricultural and food waste. However, producing biofuels such as bioethanol from food crops is not sustainable, as it depends on seasonal production and uses land that can be better purposed for food crops.

Traditional bioethanol production also faces problems with water consumption. Many international bodies have highlighted the critical issue of water poverty in several developing nations, and the consumption of this vital resource for bioethanol production is exacerbating this key social issue.

Bioethanol produced from waste lignocellulosic materials and other non-edible resources circumvents these issues. Fuel can be produced from a wide variety of waste products such as straw, forestry residues, and sawdust. These materials have the advantages of not competing with food crops, renewability, circularity, abundance, and seasonal independence.

There are drawbacks associated with using waste materials for bioethanol production, however. Biomass typically must be pre-treated, and conversion processes are costly and complex. To address the technical issues with utilizing food crops and waste materials, research has focused on utilizing microorganism biomass in recent years.

Producing Bioethanol from Microbial Biomass

Microbial biomass has several advantages for the manufacture of bioethanol. Biomass derived from these organisms can be produced cheaply in a short period of time, producing abundant amounts of recoverable materials. One of the main sources of biomass for biorefineries is microalgae.

There are, however, some challenges still to overcome with these processes. It is still a novel field of research, is expensive, has scalability issues, and requires significant amounts of carbon dioxide to produce raw materials. Additionally, there are unresolved environmental, social, and contamination issues.

Biomass pretreatment is an essential step in bioethanol production. Physical treatment and microbial biodegradation are widely employed methods that are considered eco-friendly and can efficiently retrieve valuable products such as polysaccharides. Pretreatment of biomass can also reduce rigidity and crystallinity.

Trichoderma reesei is a widely used fungal species that secretes hemicellulose and cellulase enzymes. This commercial-scale fungus breaks down biomass and produces fermentable monosaccharides which can be metabolized by other micro-organisms such as S. cerevisiae. Using microorganisms such as these can produce high volumes of bioethanol via simple and scalable processes in biorefineries.

To improve the efficiency of bioethanol production from microbial biomass and enhance the stability of processes, several immobilization and bioencapsulation strategies have been explored. However, challenges occur with these techniques such as cell leaks, excessive costs, and limited product and substrate diffusion.

Recently, an innovative process called the Small Bioreactor Platform technology has been developed. Microbial cells are encapsulated without the need for immobilization or absorption on gelatinous matrices. Inside the capsules, the microbes are held in a free suspended state. Capsules are constructed from microfiltration membranes, which have benefits such as higher permeability rates compared to traditional polymeric beads.

The Study

The team behind the paper in Energies has developed a Small Bioreactor Platform process that uses encapsulation of T. reesei, P. stipitis, and S. cerevisiae to continuously produce bioethanol from cellobiose and xylan. Corn core was used as the raw material for xylan production.

Post-encapsulation viability, biological activity, and bioethanol production were evaluated in the paper. Moreover, the authors evaluated the longevity of the process over a period of three months. The authors evaluated two process configurations. The first configuration involved columns of all three encapsulated microorganisms. In the second configuration, separate columns of yeast and fungal cells were used in series.

Cellobiose and xylan concentrations during consumption by T. reesei cells. The cultivation was based on: (a) cellobiose as the carbon source; (b) xylan as the carbon source. Image Credit: Rahamim, V et al., Energies

Study Findings

Physical encapsulation of microorganisms in the process’s medium with abundant nutrients enhances the proliferation of micro-cultures over several weeks. Another benefit of the proposed system is the simultaneous fermentation and saccharification without the need for cell or matrix renewal. A 60-70% system efficiency was achieved, with the goal of continuous production achieved.

The process used low concentrations of substrate materials; therefore, bioethanol yields were low. The authors have stated that future experiments using higher substrate concentrations are needed. Increased residence time leads to prolonged microorganism exposure to substrates and tuning this residence time can lead to controlled process yields. Further studies are needed on other substrates.

At the end of the study, there was no significant change in the structure of the capsules. Furthermore, no changes to microbial cultures were observed. Additionally, the simultaneous nature of the process and prolonged micro-organism viability provides benefits in terms of capital costs and significant improvements in the conversion of sugars to bioethanol.

Whilst further studies are needed, the process demonstrated in the paper is highly promising for the production of sustainable, green bioethanol.

Nestlé Partners With Corbion To Explore Microalgae Ingredients For Plant-Based Lines,"3 Mins Read

Global conglomerate Nestlé has made another step towards increasing its plant-based portfolio with a new partnership with Netherlands-based Corbion. The two will work to develop microalgae-based ingredients that can be added to animal-free foods to improve nutrition, taste, and sustainability for new products.

Microalgae have been shown to offer significant health benefits to vegan food products. A clean source of protein, fat, and nutrients, they tread lightly on the planet during manufacturing, thanks to fermentation technology. Nestlé and Corbion will develop microalgae products with lower carbon, water, and land footprints than other more conventional ingredients.

Adding to plant-based foods

The ultimate aim of the new partnership is to create a range of microalgae ingredients that can be used internally and commercially. “We are actively exploring the use of microalgae as an alternative protein and micronutrient source for exciting plant-based products,” Stefan Palzer, CRO for Nestlé said in a statement. “Through the partnership with Corbion, we will be able to use great-tasting, nutritious microalgae-based ingredients to innovate across our different product categories.”

Nestlé currently enjoys market presence across a range of plant-based areas, including beverages, meat alternatives, and ready meals. All are expected to benefit from microalgae developments as they progress. It is not yet known what form the microalgae will take, though protein-rich flour is a known and widely used application.

“We are excited to partner with Nestlé to develop the next generation of algae-based ingredients,” Marc den Hartog, executive vice president of innovation platforms at Corbion, said in a statement. “Corbion has already demonstrated the value of algae in several high-value food and feed applications. This new protein partnership with Nestlé has the potential to open important avenues for algae-based products into large global markets.”

A market leader in the supply of lactic acid and associated derivatives, Corbion expanded its reach to include microalgae with the acquisition of Terravia, formerly Solazyme, in 2017.

Nestlé’s plant-based revolution

Last month, Nestlé shared its 2021 earnings report with global revenues reached $94 billion and plant-based foods being heralded as one of the bigger growth categories, with sales around $860 million driven by products like Vuna and the Awesome Burger.

The company has credited a commitment to sustainability for its continued growth within the plant-based sector. Having committed $1.2 billion to regenerative agriculture, the company, once plagued by links to child labour, has revealed an intention to pay a premium for raw materials, moving forward.

Investment into other vegan brands has further tightened Nestlé’s grasp. In November last year, it backed California’s Sundial Foods, a startup known for its ultra-realistic chicken wing analogues. Nestlé contributed to a $4 million seed round that was completed to bring products to the U.S. market by spring this year.

Big names heading plant-based

Alongside Nestlé embracing plant foods, Unilever recently published findings from in-house research that confirms a plant-based diet is best for people and the planet.

The reveal came as a shock to many, owing to Unilever’s size and extensive portfolio of non-plant-based brands. It has made moves into the sector, with the acquisition of The Vegetarian Butcher and increased vegan options from existing brands, including Magnum. The latest report takes things a step further and highlights the importance of moving away from animal-sourced ingredients, for climate change reversal and personal health.

"With Foodtech Bridge, Green Circle Capital Highlights the NYC-Israel Food Tech Connection","Food tech might not be the first thing you associate New York City or Israel with, but Green Circle Capital Partners, a boutique investment firm specializing in natural product brands and food tech, is on a mission to change that. Last month, I joined investors, startups, academics, industry enthusiasts, and commercial partners from the United States and Israel at the Cornell Tech campus for the Green Circle NY-Israel Foodtech Bridge Conference.

The conference, hosted in collaboration with The Kitchen FoodTech Hub, Cornell College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and Technion, explored a variety of food tech related topics including climate solutions, intellectual property, venture financing, scaling and finding distribution partners, and research and academic opportunities.

Although it covered many topics, it was clear the conference had two goals: to support cross-border collaboration between Israel and the United States and to establish New York as a hub for food tech. It’s difficult to achieve those goals in a single conference, and some of the missions described sounded very far-off, but I enjoyed learning about the small steps that can be taken in the right direction.

The startups pitched ideas related to alternatives, including cultivated meat, plant-based and cultivated fish, animal-free dairy products, fermentation, and microalgae. One memorable insight was from The Good Food Institute’s Bruce Freidrich, who noted that alternative proteins are the only climate solution in food and agriculture tech analogous to electric vehicles or clean energy. This was particularly interesting to me because the scalability of alternative proteins is something that is often questioned since they are still more expensive than their traditional counterparts in the same way that electric vehicles are often more expensive than gas ones.

With so many different companies working towards the same goal of using food tech to combat climate change and increase sustainability in food systems, it was no surprise that collaboration and trade secrets were topics of conversation during the day. One discussion explored the idea of open-source research to allow alternative protein companies to collaborate and drive scientific discovery together. It made sense since one of the conference’s main goals is to drive collaboration, so it is only natural that the scientists, startup founders, investors, and commercial partners meet each other and find ways to work toward the common goal of a healthier food system.

The most exciting part of the conference was the startup pitches. The other startups from Israel that pitched at the conference included:

Its development, even today, isn't free of challenges, although the benefits of this kind of aquaculture are substantial at multiple levels.

""As regards the food industry, microalgae are rich in protein, contain all the essential amino acids, and have a high chlorophyll content and a lipid profile, with 60% polyunsaturated fatty acids. Microalgae such as Chlorella vulgaris are also rich in vitamins, such as B12, and minerals, including iron, potassium, phosphorus and calcium.""

""Regarding environmental benefits, in addition to capturing CO₂, microalgae have the capacity to accumulate heavy metals and are known to be able to clean up 'waste' and could be a potential solution within a circular economy approach. At Allmicroalgae, various food-grade eluIds/wastes are also being tested to produce microalgae biomass without interfering with the quality and certifications we have."" Specifically, Allmicroalgae has had the EU organic certification for the production of Chlorella vulgaris since 2018, making it the only European company with large-scale organic production. Later, in 2021, it obtained the EU organic certification for the production of Spirulina, and also has the GMP + FSA, GMP and Kosher certifications.

Also, microalgae can be used as biofertilizers and biostimulants in agriculture, can be the basis for animal feed and are an alternative and sustainable source of energy.

How are microalgae produced?

""As far as production systems are concerned, it is common to see new reactors and other innovations in the literature. But in our opinion, the production depends more on the biology than on the production systems themselves, mainly because Asian countries are already successfully producing large quantities and the technology already exists. When it comes to processing techniques, the reality is different. This is an area that is still under development.""

""Our production process for industrial microalgae species is unique, very flexible and very demanding in terms of quality assurance. The strains are kept in the most suitable conditions for cell division, and when they reach high concentrations, they are transferred to a larger volume with more space to allow them continue growing,"" says the Portuguese company based in Pataias. ""Chlorella microalgae can grow autotrophically or heterotrophically. At Allmicroalgae, green Chlorella vulgaris is produced biphasically. Initially, the inoculum is produced by fermentation and later in photobioreactors (under outdoor conditions). In addition to green Chlorella vulgaris, Allmicroalgaae also produces yellow and white Chlorella vulgaris. These products are very attractive, as the final product's organoleptic characteristics (color, taste and sensory profile) are improved.""

""Allmicroalgae also produces Spirulina and markets it naturally dehydrated in the form of paste or powder.""

A growing industry in Europe and America

These high value added products can have different applications, according to Allmicroalgae. ""They can be taken as a daily supplement in capsules or used directly in smoothies, soups, bakery products, etc. Our microalgae are marketed in the B2C market under our Allma brand and in the B2B market, both in Portugal and in some export markets.""

The microalgae market already has a long history in Asia, but in Europe and America it only started 2 decades ago. And the data published in FishStatJ confirm it. According to FAO statistics for 2019, Asia - with China at the head - produces 97.2% of the microalgae cultivated globally. ""However, this industry is growing everywhere,"" says Allmicroalgae, ""and the biggest growth is being recorded in the regions with the greatest momentum right now: Europe and America.""

""In fact, we expect this growth to continue and microalgae to become more present in various gastronomies. Europe and America have just started to produce microalgae and key players in the food industry are increasingly interested in this sector, given the different applications it could have in their current portfolio. Another relevant issue is the vegan trend, which is leading consumers to look for plant-based protein sources, and microalgae can become a very good alternative, given their nutritional profile.""

But there are still challenges for the industry, and one of the biggest is scaling up the production while guaranteeing a similar nutritional profile in every batch, they say. ""For the consumers, the biggest challenge will be to introduce microalgae in the regular diet, so that people won't consume them only as detox products, in weight loss diets or as purely healthy foods. The industry, with its R&D teams, is trying to find different applications with which to include microalgae in food so that price, taste or convenience won't be an issue. The challenge is to make consumers see microalgae not as a supplement, but as a regular ingredient,"" says Allmicroalgae.

Portugal, one of the pioneers in the microalgae market

Microalgae are a key component of the marine environment. Approximately 80% of the algae species in the oceans belong to this category, whose industry, as highlighted by the European Union, will help achieve the objectives of the European Green Pact. And companies like Allmicroalgae are actively involved in the transition to a sustainable blue economy on the continent.

""At AllMicroalgae, we are already expanding our production site to be able to meet our targets, and future expansions will depend on the demand. We conduct trials every year with different species because we are still in the early stages of microalgae production, so it is extremely important to focus and invest in research and development. There is still plenty of market potential.""

""Portugal has a huge coastline, and it is part of the Portuguese DNA to be close to the sea and to try finding new ways. The macroalgae industry has already been developing for a long time, so given the good weather conditions that the country has, it was only a matter of time before microalgae attracted the attention of some entrepreneur.""

Aviation fuel derived from garbage is taking off,"TOKYO >> The move toward sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, derived from cooking oil, household garbage and other materials, is gaining momentum in the airline industry, which has been the target of criticism because of high carbon dioxide emissions associated with flying.

Jet fuel derived from crude oil is responsible for most of the carbon emissions produced by the airline industry.

In March, All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines and 14 other companies established an organization called Act for Sky to promote the use of domestically produced SAFs.

The organization includes members such as Nissin Foods Holdings Co., Odakyu Electric Railway Co. and a manufacturer of fuels derived from cooking oil. It is working to secure raw materials and establish distribution networks.

ANA and JAL, competitors in the aviation industry, have already joined forces to promote the use of SAFs. In June both airlines flew regular flights using fuel mixed with SAF derived from microalgae and wood chips.

By 2030 the government wants 10% of aviation fuel used by domestic airlines to be SAFs.

This year the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, aims to adopt a target of net-zero carbon dioxide emissions among international airliners by 2050.

“European and North American airlines might cut trips to Japan if planes cannot refuel with SAFs at Japanese airports,” said a senior official of the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry.

Securing raw materials is one of many challenges that lie ahead.

Euglena Co. produces health foods made from a type of algae called euglena, and also manufactures fuel derived from the aquatic organism and used cooking oil. It has plans to build an SAF mass-­production site. Honda Aircraft Co. in 2021 flew a plane using an SAF manufactured by Euglena.

Accessing oil is not expected to be difficult in urban areas, where there are multiple sources of used cooking oil, such as restaurant chains. But amid the high demand for oil, there is already evidence of price inflation.

Keeping costs down will be a challenge. SAFs are three to four times the price of conventional aviation fuels.

The sense of urgency to convert to SAFs is particularly strong in Europe, where countries are setting goals for their introduction. SAFs currently account for less than 1% of the total global supply of aviation fuel.

In March, aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE flew an A380 jumbo jet in Toulouse, in southwestern France, for about three hours powered solely by SAF. The flight demonstrated the safety of SAF.

In Norway it has been mandatory since 2020 for airlines to use SAF mixed with other fuels, and Britain wants 75% of aviation fuel to be powered by SAFs by 2050.",,[],['Japan News-Yomiuri']
Microalgae’s carbon capture abilities confirmed in new study,"Microalgae from Portugal’s Aveiro Lagoon can capture as much as 12,400 tonnes of atmospheric carbon each year – offsetting the emissions of 10,000 people.

Estuaries and lagoons can act as natural carbon sinks

A study conducted by the Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies (CESAM) at the University of Aveiro (UA) found that photosynthetic organisms like microalgae can remove thousands of tonnes of atmospheric carbon each year. This finding highlights the need to preserve the tidal estuaries and ecosystems where microalgae live. Published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, the study refers to the contribution of the two main communities of ""primary producers"" of the Aveiro Lagoon and other tidal estuaries: the microalgae living in the water (phytoplankton) and those living on the sediment surface of the intertidal zone (microphytobenthos). This study is the result of field campaigns, implemented under the BioChangeR Project, and resulted from the collaboration of researchers from the Departments of Biology and Physics of the University of Aveiro and Instituto Superior Técnico. ""Primary producers are organisms, like some bacteria, algae and terrestrial plants, which are capable of photosynthesis"", explains biologist João Serôdio who, along with Silja Frankenbach, João Ezequiel, Sandra Plecha, Leandro Vaz, João Miguel Dias and Nuno Vaz, signs the work. The study quantified the carbon fixed by the photosynthetic activity of these two communities, ""but there are others that also contribute to the overall balance of the ecosystem, such as macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh plants"".

Sponsor message UMass Sustainable Aquaculture Online Courses Aquaculture is an increasingly important source of safe, nutritious, and sustainable seafood for people worldwide. Globally, aquaculture production must double by 2030 to keep pace with demand. These increases in demand for aquaculture products, food security considerations, and job creation have generated an increased need for skilled workers. Discover how you can be part of this rapidly expanding industry.

""The total carbon removed naturally in the Aveiro Lagoon will thus certainly be higher than that estimated in this study"", states João Serôdio.

The carbon capture of these organisms, explains the biologist, ""is associated with the photosynthetic process, the most important biochemical process for life on Earth, on which the overwhelming majority of living things, including humans, depend, through which carbon from the atmosphere (or dissolved in water) is used to 'manufacture' new organic matter and thus support the entire ecosystem"". The results achieved by the Aveiro research group are in line with those found for other estuarine ecosystems. In this sense, explains João Serôdio, the Aveiro Lagoon does not differ much from other areas such as the Tagus Estuary or the Formosa Lagoon. ""What was new in this study was the parallel monitoring, in various places of the Aveiro Lagoon and with a great temporal resolution, of the photosynthetic activity of these two communities"". This allowed the biologists ""to discover that the intertidal sediment zones, often ignored or considered uninteresting, are in this ecosystem the most important in terms of carbon sinks.""

The carbon removed by the totality of the primary producers from the water and sediments of the whole Aveiro Lagoon will hardly be enough to compensate for the carbon emitted by 10,000 Aveiro citizens. João Serôdio, University of Aveiro

""Despite the high rates of carbon sinks which occur naturally in the Aveiro Lagoon, estimated in our study at 12,400 tonnes of carbon per year, each one of us emits, on average, and considering only the burning of fossil fuels, 1.3 tonnes of carbon per year"", points out the biologist. But he leaves a warning: ""The carbon removed by the totality of the primary producers from the water and sediments of the whole Aveiro Lagoon will hardly be enough to compensate for the carbon emitted by 10,000 Aveiro citizens"".",,[],[]
‘Green gold’: Could we feed the world sustainably with microalgae?,"As a young child in the mid-1960s, my days were spent living an idyllic rural life on a dairy farm in the village of Lewdown in the heart of Devon. I recall many happy days exploring the glorious countryside, living a life in balance with nature and the environment – or at least, that’s how it felt.

But I also remember the ever-present slurry pit full of manure down at the end of our cowshed. It wasn’t fenced off, and my mum would remind me on regular occasions that to stray too close could mean death by drowning in what was, in essence, an enormous vat of smelly cow pats. As a five-year-old, I stayed well clear.

What we didn’t know then was that this pit of farm manure posed not only a hazard to me, but to our environment. Manure, which is often returned to the land as a nutrient fertiliser without consideration of its wider impacts, releases greenhouse gases including methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, and other harmful nitrogenous gases such as ammonia. It can also lead to nitrogen-rich run-off into water courses, polluting rivers, lakes and coastlines – with knock-on effects on fish mortality and tourism.",,[],[]
